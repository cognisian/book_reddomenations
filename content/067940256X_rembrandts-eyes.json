Very good resource for Rembrandt lovers."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Sometimes books are called \"magisterial,\" to suggest their awesome power and scope, as in \"your majesty,\" royalty. This book lives up to that term. It sweeps across a century of European history, encompassing not only the life and work of one of the world's greatest and most innovative painters (and a world-class etcher and sketcher,too), but also looks deeply at the times that shaped the man and the artistic rivalries and heroes who helped mark his path.The book basically covers Belgium and Holland from the late 16th century through to nearly the end of the 17th century. It began with Antwerp as perhaps the wealthiest city in the world and was when Amsterdam definitively became the world's wealthiest city. Because Amsterdam's wealth was based on trade, its leaders became familiar with and accustomed to art (as well as food, animals, technology, etc.) from around the world. But at the same time, they retained a very parochial sense of what the world was -- with religion at the pinnacle.Into this world, Rembrandt was born (under a slightly different name, as he took or was given the \"van Rijn\" part to reflect his adult decision to move to Amsterdam). His family was prosperous, but not gentry, and he received a good education and was apprenticed at a young age to local artists and then moved up the chain, with more important commissions, as his talent became obvious by age 20.At the same time,  Peter Paul Rubens was the most celebrated painter of the age -- considered a genuine heir to the Italian and Greek masters of antiquity. Rubens had, in fact, lived in Italy for a number of years in his 20s, imbibing the lessons of painting and, especially, sculpture. He brought that muscularity and theatricality to his paintings. And -- important -- Rubens was deeply Catholic and lived in Antwerp, which stayed Catholic during the incessant religious wars of the 16th and 17th century.  The first quarter of this book is more about Rubens than about Rembrandt, and at first it seems a curious decision, like, why do I have to wade through this stuff about Rubens (who I don't even like, as it's way too overdone and way too full of winged cherubs)? But the point is that any artist living in 1600 Europe had to start with Rubens, and then decide where to go from there.Rembrandt, who was from Holland not Belgium (oh, and by the way, Belgium wasn't a nation at the time), copied Rubens for a while. And he did it remarkably well. Sometimes even with a bit of arrogance, such as taking a pose from a famous Rubens painting and putting himself in it. But Rembrandt was not a Catholic; he was a Protestant, and while not on the level of severity of the Calvinists, he had to painting in  less florid style. The book does a great job of explaining why Catholic painting was so over the top, and why Calvinist painting of the same Bible stories or the same formal portraiture of the rich had to be so different.  Basically, Catholics believed that a church painting had to overwhelm its viewers with an emotional attachment to the subject, especially Jesus and his miracles and suffering. This was a direct bond with Jesus and the Holy Trinity -- and it had to be felt by those of high and low education immediately.  Calvinists felt this was blasphemy -- that God wasn't about feeling, but was a distant ruler who preordained whatever was going to happen to you -- and images of the Trinity was idolatry. So they quite literally painted over Catholic images in churches and would allow only art like the 10 Commandments (sounds like Islam's restrictions).  Rembrandt and many other Protestants were in the middle. They didn't go for the Rubenesque over-the-top Catholicism, but they liked their art nonetheless. So he and others developed a more muted, more realistic style to tell the same lurid and inspirational stories.  The heart of the book goes through those details, with literally hundreds of reproductions of images.It also reflected in Rembrandt's decisions throughout his career not to paint idealized people (though he did sometimes). He painted people as they really looked, starting with himself. If they were old, they looked old. If they had a wart, it showed. His women had real flab, and were not copies of Greek ideals. This was scandalous at the time and even for centuries afterwards, as critics and artists argued over whether art should show the ideal or the real.  And it resonates through to today, whenever an artist dares to show an ugly reality.  And Rembrandt was one of the first, and maybe the most prominent, to jump into the fray.The book also details the financial travails of Rembrandt (in contrast to the astounding wealth that Rubens achieved), and the sadness in his life. Like so many others of his generation, he lost children and wives to a series of plagues that came to the Low Country almost every summer, sometimes taking a quarter of the population. Now, that might make you think about God....Anyway, without going into every detail of the book, let's just say that it hits on all levels. It's a biography. It's an deep education -- painting by painting of a master painter -- with tremendous explanations in a page or less of what to look for in various works. It's a cultural history. It's a religious education with explanations I found tremendously helpful. And it explains what made Rembrandt special, especially as he aged and began to go beyond the styles that had been approved in his youth. Rembrandt began to layer his paints thicker and thicker, sometimes blending in ground up glass or ashes or even precious metals to give more texture. He stopped drawing with thin, defined lines -- although he could do it with the best of them.  He wanted to show the truth, not an idealized version of reality. And he broke new ground in painting styles, selecting what to show (such as deeper closeups than other painters, with less attention to backgrounds, so as to give more energy to the key subject).It's all there in this book.  I'll observe that this is not an \"easy read.\" It's deep, it's complicated, and I didn't understand many sections of it. One would probably have to have had a few college art classes to really understand all of it. But I got a lot out of it, and my understanding of art is much deeper than it was before."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "What a great read.  I am enjoying learning about the clients who sat for his paintings. I've seen many Rembrandt paintings in person and marveled close up in how he rendered those layers of lace with perfectly placed paint dots. This is an excellent art history book.  The artwork is impeccable and good quality and thus, the book weighs a ton,  I was going to recommend it to read on an overseas trip but it would require you to pay higher baggage fees. On the weekends I have time to have coffee and read and this book has kept me thoroughly entertained for two months now.  The writer is a master of our language and you need a dictionary once in a while.  I like the writing style very much, and always appreciate being able to drop into a different culture at a very different time, which this writer delivers in droves.  I understand Rembrandt's life better and what his paintings, etchings, and hand drawings were all about.  I have a couple of this author's books at home in the queue."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Schama wrote this in a \"baroque writing style\"?
