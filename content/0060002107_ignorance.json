I picture his narrative as cinematic, as it takes you back and forth between characters and time. This book is beautiful and it explores nostalgia, home and displacement. His origins are definitely prominent in the story and the characters are so great to connect to. This book is both philosophical and alluring, definitely recommend to read it!"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "pura fantasia"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Ignorance is a 20th century tale of emigration and return. Although the personal circumstances of leaving and returning were dictated by the historical events in 20th century Europe, the experience of long absence is at least as old as Odysseus, and he alludes to Odysseus a number of times to connect this yearning from home as part of the human condition. Kundera is a master of his craft, but the story was more of a sketch than a satisfying tale. We only get a hint of the characters. For example, we know that Josef is a veterinarian, and Gustaf is a businessman but their careers are inconsequential to the tale. Similarly, Irena has done domestic work, and her mother is similarly skilled, but that is the past, and they seem to be persons of leisure, dependent on the work of others. Does Kundera care about his characters, or are they only vehicles for exploring his wonderings about memories, identity and language? His indifference in particular towards women is palpable. The unattractive ones he finds repugnant, and the beautiful ones have character flaws that make them eventually unattractive. And ultimately, this is our dilemma with Kundera: much as we wish to nod approvingly at his intelligence and insights, we feel left out and uninvited. Our own story is part of his, but we dare not insist, because our organs are not the same as his."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Kundera weaves a few characters and the barest of plots around his extended musing on the emigrant experience of returning \u2018home\u2019. Storyline is largely incidental to Kundera\u2019s reflections, which I think are in pretty much equal parts perceptive and projection.At some points his characters seem childishly egocentric, unaware of the irony of their constant lament, \u201cNo-one will listen to me. No one is really interested in what I have to say,\u201d as they, themselves, show not a shred of interest in anyone else. This is particularly applied to the returning Czech \u00e9migr\u00e9s:The worst thing is, [the locals who had not emigrated] kept talking to me about things and people I knew nothing about. They refused to see that after all this time, their world has evaporated from my head. They thought with all my memory blanks I was trying to make myself interesting. To stand out. It was a very strange conversation: I\u2019d forgotten who they had been; they weren\u2019t interested in who I\u2019d become. Can you believe that not one person here has ever asked me a single question about my life abroad? Not one single question! Never!Where Kundera goes, perhaps, beyond this is in presenting this as a human condition thing. In response Irena\u2019s complaint about the indifference of her erstwhile compatriots, fellow \u00e9migr\u00e9 Josef asks of her adopted country:\u201cAnd what about in France? Do your friends there ask you any questions?\u201dShe is about to say yes, but then she thinks again; she wants to be precise, and she speaks slowly: \u201cNo, of course not! But when people spend a lot of time together, they assume they know each other. They don\u2019t ask themselves any questions and they don\u2019t worry about it. They\u2019re not interested in each other, but it\u2019s completely innocent. They don\u2019t realise it.\u201dOK, sure, there\u2019s stuff to mull over here (and Kundera is a definitive writer for mulling things over). Moreover he bolsters his case with suggestions that we can\u2019t really interact \u2013 our perceptions and, particularly, our memories - even of the same events - are so unavoidably disparate. This particular issue is recurring for him \u2013 or, at least, there are real shades of it in this line from The Book of Laughter and Forgetting:The invention of printing originally promoted mutual understanding. In the era of graphomania, the writing of books has the opposite effect: everyone surrounds himself with his own writings as with a wall of mirrors cutting off all voices from without.Perceptive.But, perhaps, blind projection \u2013 look at that wonderful generalisation of \u2018everyone\u2019. How far is Kundera presuming his experience \u2013 honestly and articulately expressed \u2013 is uniform? Take just the example from this extract: when people return or arrive from other countries, even other cities, in my experience it\u2019s enormously common to hear them plastered (or, if it\u2019s you, to be plastered) with questions about the experience, even to the point of the visitor getting tired of responding to similar questions. Sure some are just enquiring at a shallow, etiquette level, but many are genuinely interested in detail. I could be completely wrong \u2013 Kundera\u2019s friends would know \u2013 but from this book I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if much of these thoughts come from his own experience as an \u00e9migr\u00e9, and that he wasn\u2019t that interested in the experience of those who stayed, and was surprised at how little interest was shown in him. Many readers would be able to relate to this, but I don\u2019t know how much of this is more about personality than humanity.Other elements that make this sound more profound than whiny are: his assured prose style; educated description of subtleties of how different languages deal with the term \u2018nostalgia\u2019; and the classical motif of Odysseus. But I think this sort of thing is intellectually neutral, and, in itself, shows more about class than insight (cf. Fry\u2019s The Liar). And even though he must have been in his seventies, he still had his trademark adultery (cf. Lodge) \u2013 also seen as European sophistication in an SBS sort of way. It doesn\u2019t rule the whole book \u2013 it\u2019s more of a coda \u2013 but I just don\u2019t get how casually it\u2019s viewed \u2013 like someone deciding to try out a new hairstyle or something. I did, however, relate to Joseph\u2019s cringing at reading his old diaries, and Kundera is highly adept at evoking specific resonances like this. If you read him it might be something else, but it will probably leap off the page at you. That being said, overall this was a pretty meandering book \u2013 probably just as well it was more of a novella than a novel."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is an excellent novel.  Initially I bought this book in Prague and I did like it so much that I ordered for a friend."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This was my first Milan Kundera book and I was very pleased with my selection. Quite a straightforward and easy to read book, Ignorance is a novel that delves into the lives of refugees. Two, to be exact.How their lives have changed when they left their country, in this case the Czech Republic during the Russian invasion, and moved to neighbouring countries to make a new life for themselves. What it feels like to go back to their country of origin after so many years, how the memories they had of their past lives have become distorted by time.It was very interesting to go through this journey with Irena and Josef, and very personal as well. Both of them have come home only to feel like they did not belong any more. That their lives are elsewhere now, and that their memories as well as those of the people around them don't even match. Upon their return, they are haunted by memories they had of a time gone, they find themselves unused to this life that was once theirs, having to adjust to certain aspects and old acquaintances.Home was no longer home.I found it very interesting on a personal level, because I always wonder to myself what it would be like to return to my homeland, Palestine, and how it would feel to be back to a place I always thought I belonged to after living close to 26 years in another country that I now call home.Definitely a thought-provoking book, with many great and profound moments. I look forward to reading more of Kundera's books."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I have suffered through three or four of Kundera titles and after Ignorance I decided to actually express my views of his work.With Ignorance as with most of his late works - I can't help but think that Kundera is strapped for cash. Like with few other titles I read before Ignorance is also written in large font with huge margins on bottom, top, left and right and the typesetting is also somewhat off.Kundera talks yet again of nothing else but sexual desires and communism - which he seems to have an ongoing love & hate relationship that dictates the tone in most of his books.His description of nostalgia in couple of different languages is unnecessary since we have advanced into the internet age decades ago (which the author either didn't notice or decided to ignore) but similar descriptions and \"explanations\" (normally found in Webster dictionary) have almost always a permanent spot in each of Kundera's work which, to me it seems, serves only to fill up empty pages.Kundera views are often presented as an advice perhaps in hopes that he too will be once remembered and  respected as was Jan Amos Komensky or other great teachers? If this was the case such advise could be compressed into 2 pages and the rest of this book can be scrapped. No one will cry over it.In my opinion - Kundera is one of the most over rated author of our time. A victim of his own nostalgia about country he once decided to leave and about his sexual desires whether fulfilled or not. It may be somewhat interesting to read once but all of his books are practically the same, so you will find yourself just flipping through the pages and skipping most of the text to read few sentences that may on may not be worth reading and than you will most likely just keep on skipping pages and \"read \" the entire book within an hour."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "In this \"Homeric tale of exile, memory, and homecoming,\" as described in The Guardian, Kundera manages to explore the nostalgia, I repeat, the nostalgia of the homeland. Alongside also exploring the concepts of memory and forgetting. Kundera describes nostalgia as \"the suffering caused by an unappeased yearning to return.\" Now if we look further back and ask what causes this yearning for return, there is the spirit and the roots of the individual to the place which gave him/her existence. \"What happens to people when they have to emigrate their native country? Is it true that emigration causes artists to lose their creativity?\" Perhaps the yearning to return stems from \"no longer having the roots of their native land to nourish\" their inspiration for living. Recollections, in turn, allow the emigres to hold in memory those specificities that still link them to their homeland in that fashion of life, and possibly forget all others.Nostalgia and memory do not have a one-to-one relationship, so says Kundera. \"Whereas Odysseus did suffer nostalgia, and remembered almost nothing.\" \"For nostalgia does not heighten memory's activity, it does not awaken recollection; it suffices unto itself, until its own feeling, so fully absorbed is it by its suffering and nothing else.\" Irena is consumed by memories but feels very little nostalgia to return. In fact, it is only by her friend's persuasion that she decides to visit the homeland. She feels as though her 20 years in France, having raised her own family and made her own life, is her actual homeland. She feels she has no more ties to her homeland, no more ties even to the mother she left behind. But her memories randomly and by surprise haunt her every day life, and it is through these memories that she is pushed to return, ultimately. Josef, on the other hand, \"had neither reason nor occasion to concern himself with recollections bound to the country he no longer lived in,\" yet yearns to return and in fact does. What a complex dynamic between memory and nostalgia.Sometimes while reading this book it feels like rugged terrain, struggling to keep pace or a grasp on ideas. It seems too much in a much too convoluted sense. It feels like there are two dichotomous personalities to the book (much like memory and nostalgia come to think of it). This is especially the case when Kundera shifts from social relationships to the inner relationship within the main character with their own selves. And then much like nostalgia and memory, the novel is very interconnected, weaving a root system through the book to link the components of what makes us human as a whole. Ultimately, formulating a vision of the complexity of the human spirit.There is a special part in the novel that needs recording. It goes above and beyond the premise of nostalgia and memory. It will make you think about what truly makes us human, and why nostalgia most likely exists in the first place. This part of the book is also the link between our relationships to people and to ourselves. It also shows how very little we know, or even begin to understand, of our own makeup as human beings.
