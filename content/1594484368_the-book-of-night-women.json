From the intriguing and intricately woven storyline, to the complex and well honed personalities of the characters, to the beautiful prose and even the vulgarity of the world as it was for the Jamaican sugar cane plantation slavery culture. All narrated in a jamaican patois that rolls so smoothly along, lending to bringing the reader in to this dark and dangerous world that the beautiful smart young protoganist has found herself born into."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Wowwwwww...  I could not put the book down. I am a Jamaican living  in Mexico and seeing jamaica from an external viewpoint was very eye opening. Marlon captured the language,  culture and tradition with precision. My only regret is that he does not have more books apart from 7 killings and john crow.Will he p\u00fablish a new one soon?5 start for the way he captured this epic piece of my culture"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "My Creative Writing professor mentioned this book in class but it was her facial expression when she said its name that made me buy it.

The literal patois took a little getting used to, but once I got used to it, the power and truth of the story was riveting. The telling through the eyes of a Jamaican slave made the story all the more real and heartfelt. We'd like to ignore or forget the beastly, inhuman cruelty of slavery, but at this point in history with racism rearing its ugly face in our government, our society needs all of the reminding it can get."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Although this is a work of fiction the author made every character and situation so vivid, so real.

Even at her birth, the slave women around her recognize a dark power that they- and she-will come to both revere and fear. The Night Women, as they call themselves, have long been plotting a slave revolt, and as Lilith comes of age they see her as the key to their plans. \r\n\r\nBut when she begins to understand her own feelings, desires, and identity, Lilith starts to push at the edges of what is imaginable for the life of a slave woman, and risks becoming the conspiracy's weak link. But the real revelation of the book-the secret to the stirring imagery and insistent prose-is Marlon James himself, a young writer at once breath\u00adtakingly daring and wholly in command of his craft.", "asin": "1594484368", "rank": "133464", "city": "Jamaica", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bAgr9lMTL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
