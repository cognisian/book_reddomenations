There\u2019s something for everyone, apparently. Some are connoissuers of the aesthetics of tedium. I\u2019m not one.I guess some people like morose, self-pitying characters whose every mundane daily action gets delineated in tedious detail, along with every boring memory they have. And trust me, there are a lot of those since we spend so much time in the past, learning everything they ever did in their vapid lives. By page 200, I was rooting for the psycho to wipe them all out, just to put them out of their misery \u2013 and mine. (At least he\u2019s funny, even if his pathology is risible. But in fairness to Mr. Smith, this came a few years before people became hip to the psycho killer/profiler thing.)Also to be fair, there\u2019s one other funny thing here. I\u2019m not giving away any spoiler by saying that the deep dark horrible terrible transgression of the moral order that engenders all of this is\u2026wait for it\u2026.: a  case of the clap. I don\u2019t care who you are, funny is funny. And reading this book, you\u2019ll be desperate to find anything amusing.I also have to surmise that many readers don\u2019t mind leaden prose that goes on and on and on endlessly in descriptive detail. One reason I got this was the comparisons to Dickens, among others. Well, I just read \u201cMartin Chuzzlewit,\u201d where Chuck spends three pages describing the sign over a tavern and makes it sing. This guy spends the same amount of time describing a street I saw within the first two sentences. At least Dickens had the excuse of being paid by the word.So, don\u2019t be fooled by those who drop names like his, or Pynchon\u2019s or Dostoevsky\u2019s or Kafka\u2019s. This is not literature. This is just long. I can only think that those who compare this to their work haven\u2019t actually read any of those authors, because there\u2019s nothing here remotely reminiscent of any of them. And BTW: Bellow did Chicago better.Bottom line: If you\u2019re a fan of mysteries and detective fiction, stay away. If you\u2019re a fan of fine literature, stay away.Pick up something by Jim Williams instead. Now, there\u2019s a guy who shows how to do genre and classy lit at the same time."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Confusing and not a very satisfying read."}]}, "authors": ["Mark Smith"], "isbn": "0394487664", "longitude": -87.6244212, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "The death of the detective", "word_cloud": "lade lush detailed description everything relevant get bit much time expect action pick great long detour description people mood surroundings think character struggle follow pointless end stick end sure much love mystery self wordy fluff necessary story edit better opinion however manage finish story struggle matter much acclaim garner foe excuse pretentious write style tense story tell suppose give sense immediacy set teeth edge abandon finish chapter others enjoyable way quiet time good introduction character help move long complicate quarter overly mental rumination whimsical nonsensical chapter chapter plot easily follow instead meander thought away appearance old give fresh perspective explain many people find boring point stupefaction something everyone apparently connoisseur aesthetics tedium guess people morose character mundane daily action get delineate tedious detail boring memory trust lot spend much time learn everything ever vapid life page root psycho wipe put misery mine least funny even pathology risible fairness come year people become hip psycho thing also fair funny thing give away spoiler say deep dark horrible terrible transgression moral order engenders case clap care funny funny reading desperate find anything also surmise many reader mind leaden prose go endlessly descriptive detail reason get comparison others spend page describe sign tavern make sing guy spend amount time describe street saw first sentence least excuse pay fool drop name literature long think compare work actually author nothing remotely reminiscent line fan mystery fiction away fan fine literature stay something instead now guy show genre classy lit time confuse satisfy", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Mystery & Suspense"], "summary": "\u201cRemarkable for both its ambition and its accomplishment, it reads as though it were written by a resurrected Charles Dickens, one chilled by a hundred years of graveyard brooding\u2026every page is a pleasure to read.\u201d The New York Times\r\n\r\nA killer calling himself The Deathmaker is on the loose, pursued by Arnold Magnuson, a grief-stricken detective on the verge of a mental breakdown.
