I received this book last week, and only had time to start looking at it today. I purchased the paperback, and as soon as I started looking through it, the cover came unglued. I will be returning it, and am unsure if I want a replacement, because it appears to be poorly constructed rather than an issue with just this book. It is a shame because I was looking forward to this book, and expected better from Phaidon.One item of note, as I look at the recipes, I see that many contain ingredients that would be difficult to obtain here in Central PA."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a great, straight-forward cookbook, like most that Phaidon puts out. This book highlights the kinds of dishes that make Creole food so unique and interesting. There are sectional introductions that identify various foods in their natural state (eg, photos of the various fish and fruit) that are so unfamiliar to most continental cooks. Many of the ingredients might be hard or impossible to find outside of the Caribbean or Gulf coast, but that's no reason not to buy this book. Substitutions can always be made. While there are some recipes that many will find \"weird,\" there are many more than are very approachable and delicious!Living up in the wintery state of Minnesota, this book is a tease to read in the winter because everything in this book screams \"summer.\" Grilling fish and meat, plenty of fruit, and lots of sweet drinks; all of this makes you want to get out and start cooking in the sun. Few of these meals should ever be eaten indoors, I feel. Beautiful book and very well done!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a superb book, with excellent genuine and well-researched recipes.  I have a large cookbook library with over 600 volumes, and own quite a few books about creole cuisine already, including several 'classic' in French and Spanish, that I bought locally.  This is one of the best.  The recipes are clear, and well laid-out.  They each have high-quality pictures, and there are numerous photographs of local ingredients to help you identify them at your store.  The book can be purchased as paperback or hardbound in some kind of oil-cloth.  For a couple of extra dollars, I HIGHLY recommend the latter.  If you buy that book, you will use it!  Trust me.  The hardbound copy will last you much longer.  Shipping was very quick, and packaging was perfect.
