So much so that it leaves you with a sense, not of Summertime, but of an eternal autumn..Disturbingly honest, with glimpses of all our lives."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "In Summertime, his new novel, J.M. Coetzee has chosen to write about himself as if he's died and a biographer is trying to piece together a vision of the man from fragments.I've only just started reading it, but so far it starts with some excerpts from notebooks he supposedly kept in the early 1970's while living in South Africa. At the end of the notes are other notes in italics beginning with phrases such as \"expand upon this...\". The following chapters are named for people who \"knew\" Coetzee. The first person is asked questions by the biographer about Coetzee, but the person interrupts him to ask about these notebooks. The biographer sent the pages from the notebooks to the person for them to read and comment on. The first woman asks about the italicized notes, wondering who wrote them. The biographer says that Coetzee wrote them in 1999-2000 because he was considering making a book from the notes.Why would anyone write about themselves as if they were dead? It's not an obituary by any means.How odd to write now about yourself by creating notes that you supposedly made in the 1970's and then \"added\" more notes to in 1999, and then to have a biographer attempt to piece it all together.One clue (I think) is in a scene from these notes in which he is describing himself pouring and mixing concrete and thinking about how the concrete slab and bricks he is making will outlast him, how they are a type of immortality, and he wonders if men who work in construction think of having monuments to their own immortality all over town in the form of the buildings they worked to build.Not that Coetzee needs me to decode anything he writes, but perhaps this format of retelling your own life is constructed in such a way as to create some form of immortality for himself. Although of course there is much more going on here than that.  Instead of the quick retelling and summarizing of a life in an obituary, here is this puzzle, skewered through with these fictionalized people's lives like the rotisserie spit through a pig over a fire.I don't how I would retell my own life, fictional or real tidbits, no matter which.This novel is a fiction. Coetzee made all of this up. This is what he's been doing the past few years. While I was reading his other works, trying to figure them out, he was making more enigmas. But I'm happy to live with the unanswered questions. I think he is mountains above all other living writers today. He has more than a mastery of language and form; he has courage."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Under the series title \"Scenes from Provincial Life\", the South African writer J.M. Coetzee had published two volumes of semi-fictionalized memoirs,\u00a0Boyhood\u00a0(1997) and\u00a0Youth\u00a0(2002) that distilled some of his experiences into a novelistic format written in the third person. SUMMERTIME, first published in 2009, continues this series but makes a major change to the format and the historical basis for these events.Rather than the conventional narration of the earlier books, SUMMERTIME is a collection of interviews held by one Mr. Vincent, who is at work on a biography of the \"deceased writer John Coetzee\". Vincent wants to cover the years 1972-1977 when John Coetzee has come back to South Africa after a spell teaching in an American university, and when his literary career slowly began to take shape. (J.M. Coetzee had in fact been deported from the US for his involvement in a Vietnam War protest, and his first novel,\u00a0Dusklands, was published soon after his return). Vincent's interlocutors are four women and one man. Julia was a married woman with whom this John Coetzee carried on a brief affair. Margot was his cousin, close to him in childhood and later concerned about his having no wife to look after him. Adriana is a Brazilian refugee, who fled her expat life in Angola for South Africa and then was, to her horror, pursued romantically by John Coetzee. Sophie is a French academic who taught an African literature course with the deceased. Martin was first a rival for an academic post and then a friend. Most of the women note that he was still unmarried in his mid-thirties, and complain of how he was unkempt, either a poor lover or repellant to love, and he cannot even maintain the shabby home he shares with his father.Here is where the disconnect with real-life comes in: Coetzee had in fact married and had two children by this time. Coetzee rarely gives interviews or comments on his personal life, and that has allowed a great mystique to arise around him as an autistic loner, hopeless with women, unable to relate to others emotionally, and never laughing or loosening up. The writer uses this reputation here to achieve a remarkable effect: in talking at length about the supposed subject of Mr. Vincent's project, the people here are in fact revealing more about themselves. Coetzee has subtly turned a memoir on his own life into a detailed fictional work on four different women and how they responded to the pressures in their lives during the time they knew John Coetzee. Below the surface is a subplot on John Coetzee's relationship with his elderly father, and how the writer is torn between his need to be alone for great inspiration and his filial duty to take care of Coetzee Sr. until the end.Coetzee's style is, as usual, highly readable, the prose never too thick to slow one down -- this is the umpteenth book by him that I've read in a single sitting -- but the psychological drama is intense, and Coetzee's descriptions of South Africa really capture the bittersweet magic of that country. If I cannot given this a highly positive rating, it is because I think that the book depends for its effect too much on contemporary gossip about Coetzee, and cannot be expected to have much staying power as people forget the rumour and innuendo."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I have read this book mesmerised by the prose and because of the contents. Coetzee allow us to glimpse some periods of his life though the vision that the author thinks other people had of him,  and you don't really know what's going on: it might be the most truthful bylgraphy or the better orchestrated scam. Whatever, a gift to read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "And it pretty much stayed spot on from there.

What I got is autobiography in quite a revolutionary form: the women who knew Coetzee in his early thirties are interviewed about the now-dead author.  Utterly engaging, filled with awkward intimacy and painful slip-ups, SUMMERTIME is the best book in the trilogy.Another interesting aspect of the book:  so many \"greats\" have written their portraits of the artists as young men\u2014Goethe, Flaubert, Joyce, and Coetzee himself spring to mind.  But I've never read a self-examination focusing on this point\u2014beyond youth, \"young-manhood\", I suppose\u2014the trials by fire after self-awareness has cemented and the moral compass has been set, but before artistic recognition occurs."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Reading is possible to grasp the air of f South Africa. A writer that knows how to transmit feelings. The irony of being telling the story from the point of view of being death. I like very much the symbols Coetzee used throughout the writing .
