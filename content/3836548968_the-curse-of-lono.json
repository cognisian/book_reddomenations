Featuring all of the zany, hallucinogenic wordplay and feral artwork for which the Hunter S. Thompson/Ralph Steadman duo became known and loved, the book was at once their exemplary and most eccentric output.\r\n\r\nThe original edition of The Curse of Lono, published 1983, had long been out of print when TASCHEN brought out a signed, limited re-edition almost a decade ago. The book sold out before it even hit the stores. Now available as a standard TASCHEN edition, this fresh, smaller format, makes the gonzo masterpiece accessible to everyone.", "asin": "3836548968", "rank": "568545", "city": "Honolulu", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hzuK8EVaL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
