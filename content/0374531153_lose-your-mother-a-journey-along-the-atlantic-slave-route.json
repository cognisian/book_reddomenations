There's so much going on in here about space and geography, and the collapsing of time that is super interesting, and Hartman is a really excellent writer. The way she weaves some sentences leaves a lot of \"oh eff\" moments, and I really feel like I have to revisit this when I'm not under a time crunch to finish it for class and think a lot more about questions about ghosts and haunting for myself (I'm always thinking about ghosts and haunting.)Anyway, I really strongly encourage folks to read this, it's a great book that provides a lot of information alongside an emotional journey that's interesting and insightful to follow"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Well written but it is to me in content a book written by someone who had lost her perspective to a white-washed ideological understanding of her cultural background.

Its my DNA. Its my genetics. Its why I have a high risk of sickle cell, high blood pressure, ect. Its why I have kinky hair. Its why I am made for the sun. I've felt so lost and confused. Presently, I despise the hyphenated American attached to my African. Why? Because I feel mistreated. I see my people getting robbed of life and no convictions. We have the same issues here or anywhere in the world. You can argue with another person over what side of the city they live on. Or debate with a Native American over whos history was the worst. Its no different then our brothers and sisters on the Continent. Its hard for us to comprehend that they will not get it. Nor will we get their pain. Maybe an understanding or tolerance but its life. You were blessed to return to the Continent. Although you visited other neighboring countries, I felt like Africa was being seen as a country and not an actual Continent where millions of variois ethnic groups, cultures, and way of life of people. Its not fair to generalize. Its so sad that so called \"Black America\" is still having identity issues. You made the DNA testing sound as if it was useless. I know for a fact people have discovered their biological parents, siblings, and yes even their families on the Continent. Whos to say you even descended from Ghanians or the next? If you do fine, but now all of us do. Some of us coule be Nigerian, Senegalese, Congo.. and more. To me, Ghana has gotten much better. Its a win win situation for all. I'd say... its like hey let me promote unity and tourism and I'll help you dual citizenship (Right to Abode) as well as affordable land and more to start your own businesses. Lets not act like countries were built on everyone being gentle and simpled minded. Maybe its the hustler in me. As long as you don't harm me, we are good. In fact, the African Caribeans were recently granted Ghanian Citizeship. So it must not be that bad. I'm seeing younger and younger going to Ghana. There is also more countries to experience. You may not like Ghana.. but you may love Congo or something. Thank you so much for writing this book. I learned a lot and I am grateful. You know if we can call someone Asian or realize that Whites proudly boast about being European (celebrating Irish heritage), and even having the world speaking European languages (English and Spanish) due to their colonization and supremacy to divide and conquer... we must not be Anti-African. Its sad.. and its due to self-hate in our communities. You are so quick to call yourself a social constructed label to separate yourselves from being African. I'm talking to who ever reads this. There is nothing wrong with having your cultures.. but be real with yourselves. Stop denying being African. Thats your genetics. You can't change that based off a \"race\" aka color and a nationality aka geography. Blessings to all. If you want to look for your Continental families. Definitely try Ancestry, 23andMe, FTDNA, and upload to GED match. There is a google chrome scanner for Ancestry to even create an excel for you to find them. They would love to get to know you.

Your look at the slave trade from the point of view of the commoner IS much needed and provides lots more data on a subject that is often described and presented in ONLY the top down, objective, sterile, them vs. us manner. The information from the bottom, in my mind, is richer. It allows everyday people the luxury of participating in the discussion. They can't say,  \"I don't know,\" \"I was not involved.\" Few are correct. When evil is around, all are impacted, then and now. The Transatlantic Slave Trade was that type of evil. Your representation of it is much needed.I am only now in 2015 reading your book. I am sure your thinking has deepened from your experiences of traveling the slave route AND meeting the descendants. As a black American, I too experience the lingering, un-articulated feelings of \"alien,\" \"stranger\" in the midst of everybody. Like you, I watch many people, of all races and colors in the US and else where, try to separate them self from the slave trade. It was not me, it was my ancestors, \"they say.\" Your work allows ALL to grapple with the visual and non-visual clues in our midst that the hurt, pain and longing of \"losing your mother\" is very real and present in contemporary life.

Following the trail of captives from the hinterland to the Atlantic coast, she reckons with the blank slate of her own genealogy and vividly dramatizes the effects of slavery on three centuries of African and African American history.\r\n\r\nThe slave, Hartman observes, is a stranger\u2015torn from family, home, and country. To lose your mother is to be severed from your kin, to forget your past, and to inhabit the world as an outsider. There are no known survivors of Hartman's lineage, no relatives in Ghana whom she came hoping to find. She is a stranger in search of strangers, and this fact leads her into intimate engagements with the people she encounters along the way and with figures from the past whose lives were shattered and transformed by the slave trade. Written in prose that is fresh, insightful, and deeply affecting, Lose Your Mother is a \"landmark text\" (Robin D. G. Kelley, author of Freedom Dreams).\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a memoir about loss, alienation, and estrangement, but also, ultimately, about the power of art to remember. Lose Your Mother is a magnificent achievement.\u201d Henry Louis Gates Jr.", "asin": "0374531153", "rank": "55873", "city": "Ghana", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51nbtciIoTL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
