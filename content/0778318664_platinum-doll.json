In \u201cPlatinum Doll,\u201d  novelist Anne Girard gives us a most interesting account of one of the biggest stars of that era\u2014Jean Harlow\u2014indeed a \u201cplatinum doll\u201d (while remembering this is fiction and not biography)!  It's the Roaring Twenties and 17-year-old Harlean Carpenter McGrew runs off to Beverly Hills with a song in her heart (silent, of course, as \u201ctalkies\u201d aren\u2019t quite the thing yet), chasing a dream\u2014to escape her small Missouri town life and to become a Hollywood star!  She starts out with a lot of luck, too:  a rich husband. Once there, she  is accidentally discovered by a talent scout at the Brown Derby restaurant (who could have predicted!). She has immediate success, drawing attention to herself in Tinsel Town, where she is able to attend glamorous  parties, to meet \u201chigh society\u201d and well connected friends there, as well as to showcase her considerable talent. Driven even more heavily by her domineering mother, Harlean\u2019s ambition seems to know few boundaries.  She changes her name to Jean Harlow and the curtains rise rapidly for the young, beautiful, intelligent star to be. She also has a great desire to evolve from silent screen sensation to the  silver sound goddess.  While Girard tries hard not to make this a \u201ctabloid style\u201d novel, the reader can\u2019t help but get caught up in the \u201cstories\u201d of the stars she includes in the story, from Clark Gable to Howard Hughes, Clara Bow, and Laurel and Hardy, among others.  Girard\u2019s characterization gives us an insight into Miss Harlow who was fond of reading the Odyssey (for fun!); she had a fantastic memory as well as a very likeable (and complex) personality.  Of course, there\u2019s the price to be paid and one of the early prices are her divorce, putting up with her over-bearing mother, and the fact that she dies from kidney failure at age 26!  Girard weaves the highs and lows throughout the story, which, actually, turns out to be not only a fun, fast read but very well written. She\u2019s actually quite sympathetic to Jean, while not omitting the fact that Hollywood really can be a jungle, despite the glitter and glamour."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Quick read about Jean Harlowe, really nice story about her life. Well thought out and easy to read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I so enjoyed reading about Jean Harlow's life.  The author was good in carrying the story along.  I was left wondering how she died at such a young age...Googled it-sorry to know that another young life left us so early."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I great book to read"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This is a somewhat fictionalized story of the 1930s movie star, Jean Harlow.  The story begins with Harlean Carpenter McGrew (she would later change her name to Jean Harlow), who is newly married to wealthy Charles McGrew.  There is quite a bit of focus also on her relationship with her domineering mother.  The story ends just short of her rise to movie stardom.At first I thought the writing style was a bit over the top, but it\u2019s Hollywood and that cries for flash and fireworks and theatrical drama.  I actually grew to like the author\u2019s writing style.  Though I only read a sample of this book, I placed it on my wish list so I can read the entire book later.The book cover is beautiful."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Boring!  As a huge Harlow fan, this only covers the very beginning of her short life - no energy as we get closer to her success"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "As historical fiction, this novel fails miserably.  There are so many factual errors that it's clear the author didn't do even the most cursory research:  \"The Fun Factory\" was the moniker given to Mack Sennett's studio, NOT Hal Roach's; James Cagney wouldn't be at The Brown Derby in 1928 as he didn't arrive in Hollywood until 1930; Harlean wouldn't be wearing slacks in 1928, as they didn't come into fashion until the early 30s; etc.As fiction, it reads like a young adult novel; the characters, plot, and dialogue are all painfully contrived.  It is utterly absurd, in a Hollywood where the casting couch reigned supreme, that not one of the powerful men sexy Harlean meets on her way to stardom - real and fictional - even tries to get her into bed!  Girard spends an inordinate amount of time on Harlean and her husband's inconsequential breakups/makeups, and has a tendency to get lost in her own storylines (for example, on pg. 161 she says that Harlean's Aunt Jetty's lover left her after the death of their infant twins, then on pg. 249 Jetty says she'd still be with him if he \"hadn't gone and died on me.\").  To make matters worse, there are glaring grammatical errors (such as the use of the word \"bare\" for \"bear\") which says more about the editor than the author.For me, though, the biggest issue with this novel is that many reviewers posting in this forum think that by reading it they are learning about Harlow.  PLEASE!  So much misinformation and myth already swirl around Jean Harlow that we don't need any more!  If you want to learn about the real Jean Harlow, don't read FICTION like Platinum Doll; read the legitimate biographies Bombshell by David Stenn and Platinum Girl by Eve Golden."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I couldn't read anymore after the author wrote the part about James Cagney walking into the Brown Derby in 1928, and Jean and her friend being so excited to see the \"Matinee Star.\" James Cagney wasn't even working in Hollywood until 1930 and he wants famous until 1931, do your research."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Parts of this book were more interesting than others but that's part of what kept me lost in it.
