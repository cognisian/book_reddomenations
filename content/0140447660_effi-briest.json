Effi Briest is the generally likeable seventeen-year old daughter of an upper class family. When her mother's one-time suitor calls and seeks her hand in marriage, Effi is aware of his prospects and immediately assents - though the reader has a sense of foreboding as her playmates' voices echo into the room, calling 'Come back, Effi.'Living in a distant town, Effi's new home is comfortable but creepy, with a ghostly presence that sometimes manifests itself. And while her much older husband Geert is not unkind, he prioritizes his career in the civil service and is rather a dry old stick. And then Effi is thrown into the company of womanizing Major Crampas...Unputdownable and unforgettable."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "i love classic german literature and since this particular book was praised by Thomas Mann i had high expectations. well, i had a big let down there. a story very similar to that of Madame Bovary and i am not a fan of Madame Bovary either. my dislike is for the execution not the story..and the heroine, Effi, is so unlikeable, so annoying that i found myself wishing the worst for her-i knew what was coming and i wished it came faster! i am not used to  feeling like this while reading the classics..,i rather read them slowly, savoring every page..still,i gave the book two stars because i  want believe many maybe lost in translation, Mann cannot be this wrong.."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The translation is poor.  I've got what looks like a mixture of German and English, i.e., Dis instead of this, tling, for thing, etc.  Some words I couldn't make out at all.  So, I didn't enjoy the story as much as I could have."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Please note, I haven't finished the book itself. The two stars is only related to typos on the Kindle edition. There are at least 162 typos in the first chapter. It's quite obvious the book was simply scanned and transcribed by a computer, as specific pages have consistent typos ('th' is regularly mis-copied as 'di'). If you're looking for Effi Briest on Kindle, I suggest you avoid this version.EDIT: In addition, the entirety of chapter 11 is missing. In its place is a paragraph summary of the actual events."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I loved how Fontane described Effi's emotions and her process of growing up.

Book also excellent in setting the scenes and lives in old Prussia.

Considered by many to be the pinnacle of the nineteenth-century German novel, Effi Briest is a tale of adultery that ranks with Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina and brilliantly demonstrates the truth of the author's comment and \"women's stories are generally far more interesting.\"", "asin": "0140447660", "rank": "654611", "city": "Berlin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pW3pHwLIL.jpg", "country": "Germany", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
