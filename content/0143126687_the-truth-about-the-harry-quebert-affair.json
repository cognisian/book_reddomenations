But Marcus\u2019s plans are violently upended when Harry is suddenly and sensationally implicated in the cold-case murder of Nola Kellergan\u2014whom, he admits, he had an affair with. \r\n\r\nAs the national media convicts Harry, Marcus launches his own investigation, following a trail of clues through his mentor\u2019s books, the backwoods and isolated beaches of New Hampshire, and the hidden history of Somerset\u2019s citizens and the man they hold most dear. \r\n\r\nTo save Harry, his own writing career, and eventually even himself, Marcus must answer three questions, all of which are mysteriously connected: Who killed Nola Kellergan? What happened one misty morning in Somerset in the summer of 1975? And how do you write a book to save someone\u2019s life?", "asin": "0143126687", "rank": "81772", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519gYSFu7XL.jpg", "country": "New Hampshire", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
