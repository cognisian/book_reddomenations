No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within nocturnal black and white striped tents awaits a unique experience, a feast for the senses, where one can get lost in a maze of clouds, meander through a lush garden made of ice, stand awestruck as a tattooed contortionist folds herself into a small glass box, and gaze in wonderment at an illusionist performing impossible feats of magic.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Le Cirque des R\u00eaves. Beyond the smoke and mirrors, however, a fierce competition is underway - a contest between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood to compete in \"a game,\" in which each must use their powers of illusion to best the other. Unbeknownst to them, this game is a duel to the death, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will.\r\n", "asin": "0307744434", "rank": "3348", "city": "London", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GfkFJuPCL.jpg", "country": "England", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
