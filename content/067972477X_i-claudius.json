I don't consider myself to be super-intellectual. I started reading 12 Caesars because I love history and it sounded fascinating. I admit, however, the way it is formatted made it hard for me to enjoy and sometimes follow. I mentioned it to my friend who IS amazingly smart and well-versed in pretty much everything and he suggested I might enjoy I, Claudius since it is fiction based on the 12 Caesars and more readable (for me). I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was riveting and thought provoking. I learned more about ancient Roman culture and history and made some connections I hadn't made before about other ancient cultures of that time period. This book made me feel as if I was watching the story unfold right there. Now I do realize this is fiction and am always careful to take that into consideration, but from what I've read about the author, it seems he went to great effort to base it on as much historical supporting evidence that's available. I believe he probably closely created a book based in that time period as possible. It feels authentic (again, not a scholar nor a historian so I can only report my impressions). I definitely recommend it for any history buff. It was great and I'm just starting the next book that continues the story."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I remember reading the book in high school and then watching the TV miniseries with Derek Jacobi. When the book turned up for $1.99 I thought I'd visit it again to see if it was as good as I remembered. I'm happy to say it was, so much so that I started on Claudius, the God, and His Wife Messalina, the sequel.It must have been terrifying to live in Rome with Caligula as a near relative. Claudius took the smart way out, playing up his stutter and apparent stupidity, for all that he was a gifted scholar and historian. Through being constantly overlooked and underestimated, he survived to live to the end of this book, where he is declared emperor.I'm looking forward to the sequel to see how he manages on the throne he never wanted."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Very long and wordy.

Accordingly, it includes the history of the Julio-Claudian Dynasty and the Roman Empire, from Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BC to Caligula's assassination in 41 AD.\r\n\r\nThe 'autobiography' of Claudius continues (from Claudius' accession after Caligula's death, to his own death in 54) in Claudius the God (1935). The sequel also includes a section written as a biography of Herod Agrippa, contemporary of Claudius and future King of the Jews. The two books were adapted by the BBC into an award-winning television serial, I, Claudius.\r\n\r\nIn 1998 the Modern Library ranked I, Claudius fourteenth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 2005, the novel was chosen by Time as one of the one hundred best English-language novels from 1923 to present.", "asin": "067972477X", "rank": "42523", "city": "Rome", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517efjnUZRL.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
