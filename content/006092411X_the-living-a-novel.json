Very well written."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Nature writer Annie Dillard has given us a sweeping historical novel about the settlement of Bellingham, WA on the shores of Puget Sound, and the hills and mountains behind it. Dillard takes us through the forty years from the first permanent European settlements in the 1850s to the coming of the railroads, Statehood, and the Alaska gold rush in the 1890s. Her settlers suffer heartbreaking toil and loss along with moments of exuberance and exhilaration. Her characters' travails and triumphs remind us that life is for \"The Living.\" This novel's strong sense of place should attract especially readers interested in the Pacific Northwest.

The incredibly difficult challenge the primitive forest presented and how those forests were slowly beaten back in fits and starts set against the broader economic history of the country and the impact 19th century capitalism had on people. Character development somewhat lacking."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Artistry with words, Annie Dillard does not hide her hopeless despair with the fancy title \"the living.\"  A morose view on a world beautifully portrayed in liquid letters, The Living is laid bare as the earth: fatalism. You live. You die. Its Over. All that lives on are the generations after you.While I completely disagree with Annie Dillard's perspective, her thinking draws you in. The portrayal of the history of my home state of Washington is why I read the book and is valuable. I did put the book down because of how depressed it leaves you. While it's the longest I ever took to finish a book, the language of Annie Dillard will stay with me.It seems like people have given ratings based on the haunting she casts versus the quality or thinking behind her words. I understand. Mine is based on the latter and the brilliance behind the diverse characters and threads to the story. She move seamlessly from the rapture of creation to the various despairs of the living."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Lyrical prose.

Fortunately, she doesn't disappoint on that level. The gorgeous imagery is dispensed by means of carefully constructed sentences that are full of rich language and clever juxtapositions. I highlighted her well-phrased insights and laughed out loud multiple times, but not often enough considering the novel's size and pace\u2014both of which are comparable to the gigantic, old growth trees that the book painstakingly describes.Alas, \"The Living\" is underwhelming as a story\u2014even by the standards of literary fiction. The summary on the book jacket describes all the action you can expect to see. The story might appeal to those who enjoy sprawling epics\u2014emphasis on \"sprawl\" rather than \"epic.\" In my opinion, there are far too many characters, few of whom are proactive enough to truly come alive or meet a surprising end. If you were to ask me \"What's it about?\" the best answer I could give would be, \"It's about some settlers living in Washington during the 19th century.\"After finishing this book, I'm left with some knowledge about the time period, an appreciation for the value of cookie-cutter Hollywood story structure, and a feeling of relief.
