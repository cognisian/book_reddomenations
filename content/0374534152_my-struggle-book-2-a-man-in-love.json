There's no story arch or anything resembling plot. He's basically asking big questions through the monotony of daily life, which can be a bit boring, but then will save things with profound passages throughout his books. There are times when I would have rated this book as two stars - 15 page descriptions of going to the grocery store can get monotonous, while some of his conversations in the book are heavy into theories and structures of art and literature, with some heavy-handed intellectualism bordering (at least for someone of a non-arts background) on drivel. I actually put this book down for 9 months because I got tired of it. Then I picked it back up and read 150 pages in two days. Some of it is so incredibly good, or heart wrenching, that at times I thought it was the best thing I've ever read. Descriptions of landscapes and nature, or the completely, shockingly honest way he talks about his relationships with his family, make this a worthwhile read. It's challenging at times, but the high points are worth it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "great"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great book!!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Have to be in the mood to read it.

I look forward to finding how my perception of the themes and meeting of this series change as I continue to book 3 and on, seeing how book 2 shifted my impression of book 1.

Knausgaard breaks down lived experience into its elementary particles, revealing the wounds and epiphanies of a truly examined life. \r\n\r\nWalking away from everything he knows in Bergen, Karl Ove finds himself in Stockholm, where he waits for the next stretch of the road to reveal itself. He strikes up a deep friendship with another exiled Norwegian, a boxing fanatic and intellectual named Geir. He reconnects with Linda, a vibrant poet who had captivated him at a writers\u2019 workshop years earlier, and the shape of his world changes. \r\n\r\nBook Two exposes the inner landscape of a man falling in love and the fraught joys and impossible predicaments he faces as a new father. We look on as he watches his life unfold. Love, rage, and beauty flood these pages. \r\n\r\nKnausgaard writes with exhilarating honesty and insight about the collection of moments that make up a life \u2013 the life of someone with an irrepressible need to write, of someone for whom art and the natural world are physical needs, of someone for whom death is always standing in the corner, of someone who craves solitude and love from the depths of his being.", "asin": "0374534152", "rank": "51009", "city": "Stockholm", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bp6geYqfL.jpg", "country": "Sweden", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
