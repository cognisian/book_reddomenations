I do wish that I took more care to classify and comment since memory is so unreliable.In my mind this book goes together with a book I read some time ago and remember often, but can't quite name. Perhaps it's _Survival of the Sickest_ but I can't get that on Kindle to check my memory.Anyhow - one for medicine and one more generally for the way we inhabit the planet and especially the way we grow our food - both of these books convincingly send up much conventional wisdom as mediated by powerful corporate structures with profit as a motive for understanding.For neither of these books is that the authors' aim. This particular book has become a classic on evolutionary theory, mostly because of how throughly its author documents his comprehensive survey of the field. Dissonance with general understanding (of medicine or of evolution more generally to account for both books) falls out from that documentation.This book continues to resonate because there remains hope by its end that it is because our human designs are so much deficient in the face of the greater forces of ever-evolving life on the planet, that those designs will be subsumed by something more alive.The hint is that this will depend on our own continued evolution as well. That there is something beyond consciousness and cognitive power in store for the planet, and that we are locking ourselves away from it by our only temporary but terminal for the species as we are, dominance. Pride our downfall, but also our hope, as it promises to destroy our destruction.Blessed be the meek who feel the strains of evolution more than the pride of arrival.Anyhow, this book still makes a terrific refresher on the principles of evolutionary theory. I'd wanted a different book to document recent discoveries regarding the heritability of acquired characteristics. Some kind of folding of the DNA. I'll keep looking. Because I retain hope for the flowers."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a wonderful book.

The story of the Grants' research on the \"Darwin finches\" is fascinating, but I thought the narrative did not maintain as coherent a story line as in the best popular science writing.  I thought the reflections on larger issues (e.g. science vs. religious dogma, the causes and effects of climate change, and the rapid evolution of bacteria and viruses in reaction to modern medicines) at the end of the book were well done and among the best sections."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The best book on evolution I have ever read.

It has a poor flow of thoughts and descriptions.  I think it's popular because it does canvas the central topic(s) so well .  I think there are better ways to get your head into science.
