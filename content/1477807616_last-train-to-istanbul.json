It was difficult in the beginning to keep up with characters, as successive chapters switched viewpoints, but it got easier to follow once I got deeper into the stories and the ways they intertwined.

Many of the real politicians are present in this novel. The daughter of the mentioned family marries a Jewish man. He belongs to a traditional and respected Jewish family, highly qualiified doctors for many generations. They descend from the Spanish Jews, ejected by the Catholic kings (Fernando end Isabel) in the 15th century and still keep their traditions. In Turkey they were well received and there was (and is) no antisemitism, but it is not tolerated that a high society muslim girl should marry a Jewish man, even if he comes from such a special origin. Therefore this new couple is ostracized by both families and they go to exile to Paris. When the Germans occupy Paris they move again to Marseille, under the Vichy government. When Jews are persecuted also there, they decide to travel back to Turkey, even if Tutkish Jews are protected, with great difficulty, by their neutral government. The history describes the enormous efforts of the Turkish diplomats to organize this special train which during a very long and dangerous journey through several countries finally deposits the Turks safely in Istanbul"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "While it had some suspense, the plot was fairly straight forward.
