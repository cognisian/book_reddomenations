The plot is absolutely linear.  We get on the train at point A and travel on a straight track to the end of the line.  Good, perhaps, for train travel but boring and tedious for a novel.The characters are completely devoid of depth.  An opportunity exists to get to know more about Sinclair but, although a focal point in the story, he remains one dimensional.  We also should begin to know more about Hackett but alas we merely find out about his boots and socks.  The core characters get a mention but feel like an after thought.  And then there is Teddy.  A good potential for a menacing villain but he never develops.The overriding word that comes to mind for the novel is shallow - just scoring the surface of the story, but never getting deep enough to plant any seeds to eventually harvest a crop.Too bad!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Enjoyed the book but find all the Benjamin Black novels are getting into a predictable pattern.

Emotions are extreme, inappropriate (as they say in psychology) and come without warning or reason. Reactions make no sense.  The main character, Quirke, somehow manages to get embarrassed, nonplussed, flummoxed, etc. in every sort of social situation imaginable.  He seems to have the maturity and sophistication of a 12-year-old suddenly forced to deal with adults.  The victim's daughter is like a parody of Rhoda in \"The Bad Seed.\"  The plot (who dun it?) slogs along through the weird psychological landscape.  There is an odd, almost perverse, obsession with Jews and who is and who isn't.  Not sure what, if anything, this is supposed to prove; it is terribly awkward and borders on being offensive.I gave it 2 stars mainly because 1 star should be reserved for books even worse, with terrible writing and sloppy construction.  This one, as noted above, at least is competently put together.  But that is all."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Captivating. Couldn't put it down. Benjamin Black has written a winner.

Further, Sinclair has been seeing Quirke's fractious daughter Phoebe, and an unlikely romance is blossoming between the two.
