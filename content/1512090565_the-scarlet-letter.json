This book is not one in which I am disappointed. It is a wonderful example of the author's masterfully skillful command of the English language and ability in writing a novel that flows effortlessly from idea to idea and from point to point from beginning to the end of the novel. I also cannot go without mentioning wonderful expansive vocabulary. His words were a treat to the ear. He describes a historically inspired story in profound details covering the era and the Puritans with full confidence in his knowledge of both. His explanation of his character's cognitive and emotive forces is wonderfully impeccable and in which I found at no time any cause for a fault on his part. I very much enjoyed the book and I am pleased I have allotted the time in my life for which to give it space to be read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Nathaniel Hawthorne does a great job of including detail, I think that is one of this book's strengths. It also has a very believable moral message, which makes it the classic known around the world. Classic is a repulsive word though, this book doesn't contain all the boring and repetitive characteristics of classics written 6,000 years ago. The book isn't just some ancient work written in an Italian province either. It was written here in america, maybe a little under 200 years ago. Classic maybe, but this is the only classic I'll read."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The Scarlet Letter by Nathanial Hawthorne was a book assigned to me to read and I was prepared to hate it. Upon reading it, however, I found it to be a wonderful novel which still makes valid points today, almost 200 years after it's publication. Hawthorne was deeply insightful in this novel about the intricacies of human nature. The entire novel is a perfect view of all of the flaws in the human race including the vices of jealousy, passion and cowardice. Through the actions of the Reverand Dimmesdale, Hester Prynne and Roger Chillingworth, Hawthorne was able to portray all aspects of emotion. Chillingworth's actions can all be justified by his love for Hester and the intense jealousy he felt for Dimmesdale. Hester's strengths and weakenesses were shown through the great courage she had in staying where she was hated and also in never making her accomplice own up to his actions. I loved this book and even though it was tough to read, it was well worth it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I couldn't put it down.  Loved it!

Its great dramatic force depends entirely on the mental states of the actors and their relations to one another, \u2014relations of conscience, \u2014 relations between wronged and wrongers. \r\n\r\nIts great burden is the weight of unacknowledged sin as seen in the remorse and cowardice and suffering of the Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale. Contrasted with his concealed agony is the constant confession, conveyed by the letter, which is forced upon Hester, and has a double effect, \u2014 a healthful one, working beneficently, and making her helpful and benevolent, tolerant and thoughtful ; and an unhealthful one, which by the great emphasis placed on her transgression, the keeping her forever under its ban and isolating her from her fellows, prepares her to break away from the long repression and lapse again into sin when she plans her flight. \r\n\r\nRoger Chillingworth is an embodiment of subtle and refined revenge. The most striking situation is perhaps \"The Minister's Vigil,\" in chapter xii. The book, though corresponding in its tone and burden to some of the shorter stories, had a more startling and dramatic character, and a strangeness, which at once took hold of a larger public than any of those had attracted. \r\n\r\nThough imperfectly comprehended, and even misunderstood in some quarters, it was seen to have a new and unique quality; and Hawthorne's reputation became national.", "asin": "1512090565", "rank": "25922", "city": "Boston", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41OgsFocWEL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
