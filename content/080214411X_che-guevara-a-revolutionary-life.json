I thought it was pretty balanced; I saw the good and bad. Che was no saint, but he had profound compassion for the poor and underclasses and put his life on the line for his beliefs. But he also had a cruel, even brutal side. Certainly one of the last century's most fascinating characters."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great book I read it a couple of months ago, and really enjoyed it.

Jon Lee Anderson\u2019s biography traces Che\u2019s extraordinary life, from his comfortable Argentine upbringing to the battlefields of the Cuban revolution, from the halls of power in Castro\u2019s government to his failed campaign in the Congo and assassination in the Bolivian jungle.\r\n\r\nAnderson has had unprecedented access to the personal archives maintained by Guevara\u2019s widow and carefully guarded Cuban government documents. He has conducted extensive interviews with Che\u2019s comrades\u2014some of whom speak here for the first time\u2014and with the CIA men and Bolivian officers who hunted him down. Anderson broke the story of where Guevara\u2019s body was buried, which led to the exhumation and state burial of the bones. Many of the details of Che\u2019s life have long been cloaked in secrecy and intrigue. Meticulously researched and full of exclusive information, Che Guevara illuminates as never before this mythic figure who embodied the high-water mark of revolutionary communism as a force in history.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuperb . . . Mr. Anderson does a masterly job in evoking Che\u2019s complex character, in separating the man from the myth . . .\u201d The New York Times Book Review", "asin": "080214411X", "rank": "46106", "city": "Havana", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514vLNBI2cL.jpg", "country": "Cuba", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
