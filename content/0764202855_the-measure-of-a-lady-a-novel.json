Yes, I did get annoyed with the protagonist on occasion because she was so stubborn in her ways, but I understood where she was coming from and her struggle to stay moral in a place where morals seem inconsequential. Many of the errors/challenges Rachel made or faced came from inexperience and naivet\u00e9, which she would soon come to recognize and strived to problem solve in the best way she knew how. I don't have any scruples with the writing/characters themselves because I feel they are well written and designed to be flawed just like we all are; any frustration I have is with Rachel's inconsistency and mixed signals she sent regarding her love interest, which I feel is a very human, youthful mistake. In light of all that I've said, I enjoyed seeing the characters grow and appreciated how the author concluded the story. If you like this book or Romance/Historical Fiction in general, I strongly recommend Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers, or anything by Karen Witemeyer."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The first part of the book was very disturbing but at the end I see a tremendous lesson was learned in thereby to be taught to others."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I AM WONDERING IF THERE IS A CONTINUATION OF THIS STORY IN ANOTHER NOVEL.

Even when you're the only respectable woman around, protesting the decadence of a city lost to gold fever. Dress Modestly. Wear your sunbonnet at all times. Ensure nobody sees your work boots muddied by the San Francisco streets. Remain Devoted to Family. Protect your siblings from the lures of the city, even against their wishes. Stand Above Reproach. Most difficult when a wonderful man turns out to be a saloon owner. Rise Above Temptation.
