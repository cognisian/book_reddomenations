Dennett tells the story not through a relentless narrative, but with hints and feints like she's fencing with her reader until all the pieces come together. At the same time she does a wonderful job of world building, full of smells and dust and noises from the crowd. I found myself sneaking time away from my day to read a few more pages."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Book arrived on time, in good condition and at a good price.

A splendid read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is the wonderful first volume of Dorothy Dunnett's series, \"The House of Niccol\u00f2.\" A rollicking adventure in mid 15th century Flanders and Italy.

The set piece with the ostrich is a classic scene that has stayed with me for almost 30 years."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Dorothy Dunnett is an amazing author!

The time is the 15th century, when intrepid merchants became the new knighthood of Europe. Among them, none is bolder or more cunning than Nicholas vander Poele of Bruges.\r\n\r\nNiccol\u00f2 Rising, Book One of the series, finds us in Bruges, 1460. Jousting is the genteel pastime, and successful merchants are, of necessity, polyglot. Street smart, brilliant at figures, adept at the subtleties of diplomacy and the well-timed untruth, Dunnett's hero rises from wastrel to prodigy in a breathless adventure that wins him the hand of the strongest woman in Bruges and the hatred of two powerful enemies. From a riotous and potentially murderous carnival in Flanders, to an avalanche in the Alps and a pitched battle on the outskirts of Naples, Niccol\u00f2 Rising combines history, adventure, and high romance in the tradition stretching from Alexandre Dumas to Mary Renault.
