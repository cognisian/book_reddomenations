I am a bit of a dystopian fan, but this went a bit deeper in identifying a warning of sorts on where we could be heading in the future as a consumer in an industrial world with a never ending appetite for happiness. I would recommend this book to anybody who sees the world as slowly being engulfed in addictive time-wasting activates. Huxley beautifully portrays where the world might lead if people get accustomed to drugs, electronic screens, and sex as their daily activities.For a brief look at what you have to look forward to in this book; God is absent, people are no longer born, they are produced on assembly lines, all books with any philosophy or emotion are burned or put in a vault, families have gone extinct, and everyone gets around in helicopters. Their role in society is dictated before they were born and are constantly fueled with sex and drugs (provided for by the government) to be happy. From a young age, children are conditioned to not fear death, to hate books, and anything colorful. This book kept my attention because of the uncanny resemblance to some of the same ways that we fall into these types of addictive traps in our own lives. Huxley was a true visionary to be able to make this book and predict how humans would slowly obtain a reliance on activities that provide artificial happinessAt times, the book is tough to follow due to the unique dialog, but it is definitely worth the read, especially if you want an experience in thinking through the grand question of \u2018better to be happy or free\u2019."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It was a really advanced lecture for its age, and I would recommend it because it gave a view of what might be coming in our society."}]}, "authors": ["Aldous Huxley"], "isbn": "0060850523", "longitude": -0.12574, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "Brave New World", "word_cloud": "dystonia future prophecy elements author become closer modern reality ever along reason reminder humanity evolve much however quickly change technology ever changing culture past point heeding warning doom live nightmare long ago imagine along enjoy novel much think much realistic vision future mass baby electrocution scene epic get look different time philosophical take dystonia future enjoyable challenge anyone interested subject work great classic buy son want along enjoy interest look people saw future see lot whats happen today talk put right middle dystonia universe hard follow interest truncate end let some ponder loooovvveeee this bite dystonia fan go bit deeper identify warning sort future consumer industrial never end appetite happiness anybody see slowly engulfed addictive activates beautifully portray people get accustom drug electronic screen sex daily brief look forward absent people longer bear produce assembly line philosophy emotion burn put vault family go extinct everyone get helicopter role society dictate bear constantly fuel sex drug provide government happy young age child condition fear death hate anything colorful kept attention uncanny resemblance way fall type addictive trap live true visionary able make predict human slowly reliance activity provide artificial happiness at time tough follow due unique dialog definitely worth especially want experience think grand question better happy free really advanced lecture age give view come society", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Science Fiction"], "summary": "Brave New World is a novel written in 1931 by Aldous Huxley and published in 1932.
