He writes about Australia and is held up as an example of someone who gives an accurate account of the young country.It is generally held that Patrick White is not an easy author to read.Of my friends, I know only one who has voluntarily read a whole book of his, so I resolved to find out for myself what the enigmatic author is like.I, a Queensland inhabitant, picked A Fringe of Leaves, partly because we had a copy at home and partly because it is a depiction in part of early British Queensland, Moreton Bay settlement and Fraser Island and the aborigines living there. Also it describes English-Australian interactions and its protagonist is a woman. Given Patrick White's personality, that also whet my curiosity.The book follows the heroine from the UK to Australia with her husband to meet her brother-in-law and then sail back to the UK. Unfortunately, on the return trip the ship, on entering Queensland waters, encounters thick fog and one thousand miles south of the Great Barrier Reef founders on a coral reef in the middle of the ocean. Somehow the survivors of the shipwreck struggle to Fraser Island, the largest sand island in the World. There is some confrontation with the locals for reasons that are not made clear and all but the heroine die.She ends up with the aborigines and is rescued from them by an escaped convict who guides her back to \"civilization\" in Moreton Bay from where she heads off back to Sydney.There are two main attractions to anyone contemplating reading Patrick White, one is his descriptions of colour which are very unusual and graphic. He uses words for colours that were quite unusual and vivid [garnet, ochre, onyx, topaz, the colour of raw cobalt shot with bronze, livery, plum, silver gold]. The other attraction to Patrick White is that he is marvellous for anyone with insomnia. I know of no other author with the same ability to close his reader's eyes after only two or three pages, consistently night after night. This is a highly potent effect and it is quite magical how he is able to achieve it. One night I had three pages to the end and just simply could not finish.But there are drawbacks too. The book although purportedly about Australia doesn't sound Australian even though it is set in Australia. It sounds more like an Englishman/Pommie trying to write about Australia, so the effect is quite troubling. Also, the story, although supposedly based on an actual event, just does not ring true and indeed is totally implausible, if analysed in any depth. White has an ocean-going ship sailing very close to the mainland coast in the middle of a fog. Even though fog in the subtropics cannot be very common and even if there were fog, surely the ship's captain and navigator can stick to the chart and avoid reefs especially since they are at least 1000 miles away. The fight between the shipwrecked and the aborigines is also highly implausible and out of character. Particularly since the local aborigines have been kind to another European who arrived among them in much less favourable circumstances. And then White goes on to describe cannibalism which is just untrue and is simply the repetition of a myth that has no factual basis.Finally his description of the woman protagonist is about as distorted as his description of the place and the inhabitants. It is equally prejudiced.But by far the worst part of the whole book is that although White writes at great length about very little, his writing is not only tedious it is incomprehensible. The last paragraph in the book I have read and reread about 10 times and still I am uncertain what he is trying to say.I would say that A Fringe of Leaves would get the prize for the worst book I have read since I have been in Australia in the past 20 years. It does literature, Australia, Women and Aborigines all a great disservice when I can understand what he is writing about, but there are times when it is just impossible. He has an uncanny ability to write up to a hundred pages without actually saying anything meaningful or memorable. As a result, I regret that I have lost respect for White.One reason we have literature is so that writers can make certain situations clearer and help the readers to think about them in a different way. That is achieved by a variety of mechanisms, but language is to facilitate communication. A decent author should be able to paint word pictures of events or ideas in a vivid clear form. White on the other hand has the ability to obscure even the most clear-cut situation by copious verbiage.And one reason we have book reviews is to try to steer people towards good books and away from bad ones. Book reviewing is not a blood sport, but without some guidance and honesty in our opinions, we would all end up reading more junk than the greats. My ambition is to try to stick to the better books and to help others to do the same.Take my advice, avoid this book like the plague, unless you are looking for a medication-free treatment of insomnia.Educators, please oh please, think several times before inflicting this turgid, racist, misogynistic, mythological drivel on young folks in the future; there is a great danger that you will put them off reading for life."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Other reviews of this book talk about the narrative, which is a compelling true life story of Eliza Fraser, her shipwreck and life living with aboriginies. However, while the novel suceeds at this level, there are many more layers to this book. The title of \"Fringe of Leaves\" is a a clue to the central themes. The fringe is a recurring motif, initially as a leaf patterned shawl, then a \"grass skirt\", but also referring to Australia as a continent with fringe of trees around the dry interior. To me this fringe of leaves is an outward \"skin\" that hides the reality beneath. The Eliza Doolittle-like transformation of Ellen from farmers daughter to \"lady\", then back to naked aboriginal are are all just superficial changes that do not really change the core of the person beneath. The changing shells of Ellen can also be seen as references to Australia as a nation, with the colonialization, convict influence and aboriginal people, mirroring the three \"states\" of Ellen. This is a rich and brilliant book that is full of 'clues' that reward the the thoughful reader, don't miss them."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "What riper themes for a 'historical' novel?  Patrick White's \"A Fringe of Leaves\" is exactly that, a historical romance set in Australia in the 1830s, when much of the country was as yet unconquered by its English and Irish settlers, a good number of whom were convicts. Fringe was first published in 1976, but in many ways it reads as a late-Victorian novel. There's a tremendous amount of Thomas Hardy about it, in subject matter, in narrative structure, and in its bitter-to-bittersweet outlook on humankind. The central tale of romance, between a strong-bodied young woman and a bookish older man, has echoes of George Eliot's Middlemarch -- intentional, I think -- and the survival tale that emerges as the second half of the novel, after a shipwreck, reminds me inexorably of Joseph Conrad. Then, when the heroine is 'adopted' unwillingly into non-European culture, I can't help thinking of E. M. Forster's \"Passage to India\". Forster's and White's uneasy attitudes toward erotic encounters are of a kind.But Patrick White was his own man as a writer, and had his own very recognizable narrative voice. He mixed crisply evocative scenic descriptions with almost parenthetical wit and irony. His persistent tone of surly superciliousness toward his own characters,his creatures of imagination, may require a breaking-in period for many readers. I was strongly 'put off' by it when I read \"Voss\", my first encounter with White. However, in \"Fringe of Leaves\" the author created a compelling female character, Ellen Roxburgh, of more persuasive reality than almost any other heroine in fiction portrayed by authors of any gender persuasion. Mrs. Roxburgh is the survivor, and the horrors she survives would seem impossible except that they are utterly true to history, very similar to the accounts of the sufferings of the real-life American Captain James Riley, a shipwreck castaway enslaved by Bedouins in the Sahara in the early 1800s.As I've already suggested, this is a novel with two halves -- the first a story of love and guilt among the Anglophone settlers, and the second a grueling narrative of captivity and escape -- but the two halves are jointed together masterfully by a shipwreck scene worthy of Conrad or Melville. And then there's an ending... the most unexpected, puzzling, ironic ending/non-ending one could ask for, the kind of ending that first makes you want to heave the book into the surf but then compels you to acknowledge it as the only thing plausible.This is a \"page-turner\", whatever other impression of difficult earnestness I may have suggested. It would be possible, for a less compulsively analytic reader, to 'go with the flow' of passions and pangs, and to read \"A Fringe of Leaves\" as a flaming romance. Whatever sort of reader you are, give it a shot! It's perhaps the best 19th Century novel written in our lifetimes."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Mrs Roxburgh and her husband set sail for England from Austrailia. The Bristol Maid is shipwrecked and she is taken prisoner by cannibilistic aborigines...  On one level this is a first rate adventure story of love, betrayal, capture and escape. But such is the power of Patrick White-and as with his other great works-this is also a brilliant exploration of man-the beast-and the nature he is bound by. White appals the reader with the manner in which the aboriginals enslave and treat Ellen Roxburgh,but deftly illustrates that no matter what cultural angle we take or live by,they are all just a veneer over our true savage selves. If the aboriginal customs and rites that guide their lives shock civilized sensibilities,what so about civilization that has enslaved men and women in a brutal penal colony,stringing up the bodies of captured bolters 'as a warning to the rest'?. Yes its covered up with aesthetics and manners,but it is still as savage as any 'primitive' culture. This is a truly great piece of work.  White writes in meticulous detail, so vivid that it conjures pictures in the mind that forever will remind you of the story.  It is impossible to say what serves as Whites masterpiece as his great novels-'Voss' 'Tree of Man' 'Riders in the Chariot' 'Solid Mandala' and 'A Fringe of Leaves' are all so superbly of a high standard that maybe only his collected works in one volume could be considered as such. A true nobel writer."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "There is a touch of the chaos in Fringe of Leaves. It is not boring and it is one of White's better novels. It has a good story and I will not reveal the plot beyond what the publisher reveals on the book jacket.I have read three of White's novels: the present work, the Tree of Man, and Voss. The present novel, is more complex than Voss, and unlike Voss here the author manages to breath some life into the characters. It has a good plot that reminds one a bit of Jane Eyre, but with quite a different setting. It is set in England in the middle of the 19th century. It is about a young woman from Cornwall who marries a wealthy gentleman. They go to Australia and are caught in a ship wreck off the coast of Queensland after visiting the husband's brother in Tasmania.White uses stream of consciousness in a mild form which seems a bit novel after reading Voss. But the thing that grabs your attention is his use of structure. He introduces the protagonist, Ellen, by having two ladies describe her for about 20 pages. The two women ride in a horse drawn carriage chatting about Ellen. You, as the reader, realize that White will be creative in what will follow in the story.After that we move the present scene in the story. But Ellen has these flashbacks to fill in the story of her life over most of the first half.Patrick White gained fame as the Australian Nobel prize winner in literature and as a person with a prickly or difficult personality. He was educated at Cambridge but settled and wrote in Australia after World War II. He wrote about a dozen novels and a biography.This is a good novel and it deserves 5 stars. After a dozen pages or so it becomes clear to the reader why White is famous: he has an unusual style and he is a gifted writer. There is no question about his writing ability. We see great writing ability in Voss and that skill is present in The Tree of Man and in the present novel.Overall, I thought it was a good book and an interesting read and an interesting book to read if you are interested in the works of Patrick White."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Read any review of Patrick White\ufffds A Fringe of Leaves and you will expect it to be an exciting tale.  One that includes adventures on the sea, a frightening shipwreck, and deaths of important characters; a tale of enslavement by the wild and savage Australian aborigines, sex, and cannibalism; a tale of the heroic rescue of a damsel in distress by an escaped convict.  But if you are expecting this adventurous and daring plot, you may turn away disappointed.  You may read halfway through the book and not encounter more than one or two of the events mentioned in the reviews. What is it, then, that makes A Fringe a five-star read?  Why do many readers across the globe claim it to be one of Patrick White\ufffds most brilliant works? This is not, in fact, merely a story of adventure and excitement.  It\ufffds a mission of humanity.  Ellen Roxburgh is the image of any individual with conflicting views of life within herself.  This is not a story of rescue, but one of survival.  It reminds us all of our own personal inner struggles and how much we have been able to overcome.  It is a reminder that the loss of innocence in every child is the first step in that child\ufffds becoming an adult. A Fringe is also an anthem of cross-culturalism that sings true today in America, though it was set in 19th century Australia.  Living here, we have all acquired or developed a certain social standard unfamiliar to our infant natures.  From living among many legions of immigrants, or even from traveling abroad, we know what it is to subscribe to other social standards.  A Fringe explores the effects of such an initiation in Ellen Roxburgh\ufffds character.  This initiation is exhibited as the cause of her internal conflict of social behaviors.  She began as a Cornish farmer\ufffds daughter, and then developed a fa\u00e7ade of proper civilized mannerisms when she married her aristocratic husband.  She initiated another set of social standards when she was forced to live among the aborigines.  White\ufffds moving depiction of this struggle will inspire and comfort the patient reader. Patrick White\ufffds A Fringe of Leaves may not satisfy an impatient adventurer.  But it surpasses its acclaim of literary merit in its brilliant demonstration of timeless humanity and cross-cultural issues."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Patrick White writes like a castaway from the Victorian era. His novels are long and full of real characters and the society and civilization of which they are a part and from which they come is equally real. Each character possesses a fully developed history, and the story as a whole progress from one point to another. And in the process people are changed by the experience. If that sounds old fashioned to you, well, it is old fashioned but those are values that some readers miss and for those readers these novels. I don't want to make White sound too antiquated though for his themes are very contemporary ,or timeless, as his themes are those that don't go out of style. This is my favorite of his novels. In A Fringe of Leaves(c.1973) White tells a shipwreck story upon the shores of an as yet uncolonised Australia. The characters who survive the shipwreck are then captured by Aborigines and must adapt to a lifestyle quite unlike the one left behind in fair old England. White uses this tale to examine civilization first by showing his characters in it and then by showing his characters as they appear stripped of it.....in only a fringe of leaves. The examination is quite a thorough and engaging one. The novel feels Victorian partly because it is set in that time (or before) but it only retains the best of that periods use of the form. White himself is Australian(and one who has won many awards, Nobel included, and to many he is the best they have so far produced) and so his study of England is tinged with an insight reserved for the ousider or in his case the postcolonial. The shipwreck portion of the book is only about 150 pages or so near the end of a 500 page plus novel. It takes patience to get to the exciting part of the story but once you are there you will want to read that section more than once. In those blindingly intense pages the characters cling to but a few delicate and sacred strands of belief to keep the savage world from totally adopting them. The aftermath portion of the book is equally interesting."}]}, "authors": ["Patrick White"], "isbn": "0140186107", "longitude": 153.0234991, "periods": ["1800s"], "title": "A Fringe of Leaves",

shipwrecked on the Queensland Coast and Mrs Roxburgh is taken prisoner by a tribe of Aborigines. In the course of her escape, she is torn by loyalties - to her dead husband, to her rescuer, to her own and to her adoptive class.\r\n\r\nA young Cornish woman, Mrs Ellen Roxburgh, travels to the Australian colonies in the early 1830s with her much older husband, Austin, to visit the \"black sheep\" of the family, Austin's brother Garnet Roxburgh. After witnessing the brutalities of Van Diemens Land, the Roxburghs embark on their return trip to England on The Bristol Maid. However, the ship runs aground on the coral reef off Fraser Island on the coast of what is now Queensland. \r\n\r\nEllen is the only survivor from the leaky vessel in which the passengers and crew travel to the shore. She is rescued by the aboriginal people of the island, and she later meets Jack Chance, a convict who has escaped from Moreton Bay (now Brisbane), the brutal penal settlement to the south. It is Chance who escorts her through the dangerous coastal territory south to the outskirts of the settlement, but who refuses to accompany her further and returns to his exile. She returns to \"civilisation\" transformed and tormented by her experience with Garnet in Van Diemen's Land, with the aboriginal people, and with Chance.\r\n\r\nThe novel sets in sharp relief the distinctions between men and women, whites and blacks, the convicts and the free, and English colonists and Australian settlers. The contrast between Ellen's rural Cornish background and the English middle-class she has married into is also highlighted.\r\n\r\nWikipedia", "asin": "0140186107", "rank": "1049251", "city": "Brisbane", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51rAZLfEQBL.jpg", "country": "Australia", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
