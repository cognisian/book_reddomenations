It's terrible as a novel.If you're interested in a 19th century piece of social criticism, this is a fascinating read. Bellamy imagines a Utopian future in which class struggle has been eliminated. Looking at the ways a text can be radical in some respects but conservative in others (race & gender), this book gave a thoughtful and at times eerie prediction, made more so by the fact that we've passed the year he chose to set this story in."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Amazing."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Published in 1888 Looking Backward takes the reader grin 1888 to 2000.

It influenced many thinkers of his time.

Forgive me, but most of the reviews leave me in shock. Looking Backward seems to be treated as a work of fiction, or else a fantastical novel about futures. To this reader both those descriptions are secondary. What is primal is Edward Bellamy's insightful, passionate, detailed observation of the madness of the world. The pure, unadulterated  insanity of Western so-called civilization. I am blown away that in  1887 the entire complex of capitalism was so deeply in place, down to the last billboard advertisement. What Mr Bellamy describes of the various quarters of then-Boston might as well be today, 2017. Incredible! The only difference being that the fear-based, ego-maniacal plummet to national if not global suicide has accelerated immeasurably.And yet, as written in the Postscript, it has happened before in history that a swift veering brought a nation or culture from the abyss (several in particular are noted) - and that it could happen again.The value of this amazing author is in his exquisitely bold and truthful description of society as it has been throughout the ages of rich versus poor. And this is what makes me weep. Nations, classes, and individual persons set one against the other as though this were natural. Walking, driving right past suffering without seeing or feeling. The protagonist himself weeps at the knowing that he, too, saw and did nothing. And I, too. Yet now am moved to as never before, as I sit in a house furnished with seats, tables, art, food and square-footage, much more than I need. How many times in my life have I dreamed of selling everything, giving half of it away and living in a village where people with brown skins sit under trees in parks and talk to each other."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Simply the most clear and compelling indictment of what we now call neoliberal capitalism, the current global form of the age-old rule of the rich. Bellamy eviscerates a social order based upon the mortal sins of greed and envy and envisions in extraordinary detail what a society might look like if it were predicated upon the best in human nature as opposed to the worst. Read this book with an open mind and heart, suspend and then overcome the cynicism of TINA (there is no alternative) that has been implanted into all of us, and not only your thinking but your life will change. What would be the full manifestation of the Kingdom of God that Jesus spoke about and urged us to bring to earth? Bellamy fleshes it out in all of its glory...for those who have ears to hear and eyes to see."}]}, "authors": ["Edward Bellamy"], "isbn": "0486290387", "longitude": -71.0595678, "periods": ["1900s", "2000s"], "title": "Looking Backward", "word_cloud": "force buy class taught total described time dumb time travel classic excite today first year ago well write great character set development surprise end put fun eventful compelling character intrigue terrible interested century piece social criticism fascinate imago utopian future class struggle eliminate way text radical respect conservative others race gender give thoughtful time eerie prediction make fact pass year chose set story amaze publish take grin author science fiction imagine world social philosophy think world influence many thinker time world imagine arrived opinion thirty year first work fascinate predicted debit card wonder world possible version rubbish correctly make good hard version download properly perfect look life base know human nature root problem certainly room make improvement eliminate political alone paint picture interesting dream want wake could weep come amazon know publish nevertheless forgive review leave shock seem treat work fiction else fantastical future description secondary primal insightful passionate detail observation madness world pure unadulterated insanity civilization blow away entire complex capitalism deeply place last billboard advertisement describe various quarter well today difference plummet national global suicide accelerate yet write happen history swift veer brought nation culture aby several particular note value amaze author exquisitely bold truthful description society age rich versus poor make weep class individual person set natural driving right suffer see feel protagonist weeps know saw nothing yet move never sit house furnish seat table art food much need many time life dream sell everything give half away living village people brown skin sit tree park talk clear compelling indictment call neoliberal capitalism current global form rule rich eviscerate social order base mortal sin greed envy envisions extraordinary detail society predicate best human nature oppose worst open mind heart suspend overcome cynicism alternative implant think life change full manifestation speak urge earth flesh glory ear hear eye see", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Science Fiction"], "summary": "First published in 1888, Looking Backward was one of the most popular novels of its day. Translated into more than 20 languages, its utopian fantasy influenced such thinkers as John Dewey, Thorstein Veblen, Eugene V. Debs, and Norman Thomas. \r\n\r\nWriting from a 19th century perspective and poignantly critical of his own time, Bellamy advanced a remarkable vision of the future, including such daring predictions as the existence of radio, television, motion pictures, credit cards, and covered pedestrian malls.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, the novel is the story of time-traveler Julian West, a young Bostonian who is put into a hypnotic sleep in the late 19th century, and awakens in the year 2000 in a socialist utopia. In conversations with the doctor who awakened him, he discovers a brilliantly realized vision of an ideal future, one that seemed unthinkable in his own century. Crime, war, personal animosity, and want are nonexistent. Equality of the sexes is a fact of life. In short, a messianic state of brotherly love is in effect.\r\n\r\nEntertaining, stimulating, and thought-provoking, Looking Backward, with its ingenious plot and appealing socialism, is a provocative study of human society as it is and as it might be.", "asin": "0486290387", "rank": "156170", "city": "Boston", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513qkeraxsL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
