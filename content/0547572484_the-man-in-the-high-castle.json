Typically opaque, as per PKD's signature, yet unfortunately devoid of any flutter of narrative urgency. Characters are scattered, gathered and then dispersed for no logical reason. One can't help but think that PKD intends to reflect on the burden and fluidity of time in relation to history. But his voice comes across as overly preachy, which is unlike PKD at all. A fascinating book of ideas, surely. For a more coherent and potent narrative work, please refer to Amazon's underrated TV adaptation."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Book came in good condition.

My brother-in-law is Jewish, he has blue eyes, blond hair, fair skin, he looks like a Nazi propaganda poster. So I can't believe Dick believes that Jews look a certain way. If they did, why did Hitler make them wear a Jewish star? With black people, brown Hispanics, Asians, you don't have to make them wear anything, you know what the are the minute you see them."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great quality...

The book describes an alternate history in which the Axis Powers are victorious over the Allies in World War II and Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan are the dominant world superpowers. It was definitely ahead of its time when first published in 1962 and won the 1963 Hugo Award for Best Novel.The book is set in a 1962 divided United States, with Japan controlling the western states and Nazi Germany the east. Dick uses multiple loosely connected characters and intertwined subplots to explore racism, authoritarianism and disillusionment, resulting in a classic \u201cwhat-if scenario\u201d novel; we meet a subservient antiques dealer, a jewish craftsman, his judo instructor wife who has walked out on him and an ethical Japanese civil servant. Many of the principle characters read a novel within the novel, \"The Grasshopper Lies Heavy\", which describes an opposite alternate history in which the Allies do in fact win the war, but with a different final outcome to actual history; the victorious British Empire becomes more racist and ends up in a cold war with the US. In addition, the characters make critical decisions by consulting the \"I Ching\", an ancient divination text which professes to guide believers along the right path.This book raises a lot of questions and unless you\u2019re a follower of the \"I Ching\", will leave you looking for answers; but if you enjoy a good story with a philosophical theme, then read this book."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The object of this is beyond me.

Slavery is legal once again. The few Jews who still survive hide under assumed names. In San Francisco, the I Ching is as common as the Yellow Pages. All because some twenty years earlier the United States lost a war\u2014and is now occupied by Nazi Germany and Japan.\r\n \r\nThis harrowing, Hugo Award\u2013winning novel is the work that established Philip K. Dick as an innovator in science fiction while breaking the barrier between science fiction and the serious novel of ideas. In it Dick offers a haunting vision of history as a nightmare from which it may just be possible to wake.\r\n \r\nDick's Hugo Award-winning 1962 alternative history considers the question of what would have happened if the Allied Powers had lost WWII. Some 20 years after that loss, the United States and much of the world has now been split between Japan and Germany, the major hegemonic states. But the tension between these two powers is mounting, and this stress is playing out in the western U.S. \r\n", "asin": "0547572484", "rank": "4310", "city": "San Francisco", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41EONpW2m9L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
