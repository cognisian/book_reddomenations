Now to be clear, I am not taking a political position as to my opinion on the state of affairs, I am merely commenting on the fact that human behavior repeats itself. And again. And again. And again.

But in our age of dynasties, mercurial social sensitivities, and politicians making love to the camera, Skeffington might as well be talking to us.\r\n\r\nNot quite a roman \u00e1 clef of notorious Boston mayor James Michael Curley, The Last Hurrah tells the story of Skeffington\u2019s final campaign as witnessed through the eyes of his nephew, who learns a great deal about politics as he follows his uncle to fundraisers, wakes, and into smoke-filled rooms, ultimately coming\u2014almost against his will\u2014to admire the man. Adapted into a 1958 film starring Spencer Tracy and directed by John Ford (and which Curley tried to keep from being made), Edwin O\u2019Connor\u2019s opus reveals politics as it really is, and big cities as they really were. \r\n\r\nAn expansive, humorous novel offering deep insight into the Irish-American experience and the ever-changing nature of the political machine, The Last Hurrah reveals political truths still true today: what the cameras capture is just the smiling face of the sometimes sordid business of giving the people what they want.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe best novel about American politics and the best novel about Irish-Americans I have ever read. . . . A superb job of vigorous, humorous writing\u2014funny, engaging, and tolerantly mellow. . . . So good, so enormously readable, and so authoritatively persuasive.\u201d New York Times", "asin": "022632141X", "rank": "466197", "city": "Boston", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510b5fGatfL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
