If that does not bother you, I definitely recommend going for it. It is about the relationship between a writer and her cleaning lady.

It is initially a deceptively simple story of basically 5 characters, 2 major ones, that takes place mostly on 1 street.  But of course, it turns into a tumultuous, wrenching life history (just like the volatile history of their country, Hungary).  The main 2 characters are vivid, complex, interesting and you care an awful lot about both. The period in question has flash backs to WW1 to present day.  Great book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very interesting read."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Very repetitive and not very holding after the first 100pages.

The principal, an elderly woman named Emerence, defies description: incisively intelligent without formal education, domineering, dignified in servitude, unsentimentally loving, selfless to death. She shadows more intelligible figures in her Hungarian town, including the intelligentsia, politicians, and the petty bourgeoisie who survived the horrors of the 20th century. In the process, she is completely without peers. Each person seems to understand her and interact with her in a unique way, revealing as much about their own weaknesses as about her strengths. At the center is an archetype: a woman who is completely incapable of understanding selflessness and love in their truest sense, and who surrenders everything to ambition. The novel is written with crushing intensity and a great feel for provincial life. This is the first work I've read by Szabo, and I'm sorry I got to the party so late."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "This book is so well reviewed, but I found it boring.

Magda is a writer, educated, married to an academic, public-spirited, with an on-again-off-again relationship to Hungary\u2019s Communist authorities. Emerence is a peasant, illiterate, impassive, abrupt, seemingly ageless. She lives alone in a house that no one else may enter, not even her closest relatives. \r\n\r\nShe is Magda\u2019s housekeeper and she has taken control over Magda\u2019s household, becoming indispensable to her. And Emerence, in her way, has come to depend on Magda. They share a kind of love\u2014at least until Magda\u2019s long-sought success as a writer leads to a devastating revelation. \r\n\r\nLen Rix\u2019s prizewinning translation of The Door at last makes it possible for American readers to appreciate the masterwork of a major modern European writer.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Door tells a great deal about the sufferings of 20th-century Hungary through the heart and mind of a single fearless woman, as Magda is taught by example to consider her own inadequacies. Magda Szab\u00f3\u2019s great book was published in Hungary as long ago as 1987; Len Rix\u2019s fluent translation is a belated and welcome gift to readers in English...profoundly moving.\u201d The Independent", "asin": "1590177711", "rank": "21330", "city": "Budapest", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/415rbk9Z1VL.jpg", "country": "Hungary", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
