This is a story about two old friends in Spain who head off on a sort of pilgrimage in their battered car. But it isn't up to the standard of his best work, eg The Human Factor. I read this one in paperback years ago, quite liked it then I thought, and recently bought the Kindle version. Unfortunately the conversations (arguments/debates) now seem laborious, and at times preposterous. Writing modern idiom makes Greene seem like a fish out of water. A young women appearing from behind some bushes asks the old gentlemen if they have been 'making out' like her! It was too embarrassing to read any more and I deleted the book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "More to it than it first appears .
