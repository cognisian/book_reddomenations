He wrote four short novels, all satirizing the American Dream, but died at age 37 when he ran a stop sign and an oncoming car killed him and his wife (F. Scott Fitzgerald had died just the day before). West penned Miss Lonelyhearts during the grip of the depression, which highlights the sadness and desperation of the times. The protagonist, which West only refers to as \u201cMiss Lonelyhearts,\u201d works as an advice columnist for a newspaper. He receives letters from people dealing with abuse, suicidal thoughts, and all kinds of grim realities he isn\u2019t suited to provide advice for. He slips into a state of depression, has hallucinatory fantasies, and starts sleeping with a woman who writes to him for advice. West creates a gritty and raw world that is realistic yet fantastic, ending with a bang that makes the entire book feel like a dream.I love Nathanael West but feel like I missed something with The Day of the Locust. It's on many \"top books about Hollywood,\" and take place in the 30s, so of course I had to read it, but for as much as it was about the geography and architecture of the city it was also about things like cock fights (which I feel like I never need to read again). I think it does show the seedy underbelly of the city well but I just didn't feel like it really went anywhere.Overall West is worth reading. He gives an insight into 30s America and the bleakness of the depression."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I read this book on recommendation from a radio personality.

I listen to the podcast \"You Must Remember This\" and it was mentioned as a story about the pitfalls of Hollywood life - I was surprised that I hadn't heard of it before. This is a quick, easy read with strongly allegorical characters exploring the falsity and destructiveness inherent in each of us.  I think this is an important read in American literature because Nathaniel West believed the American Dream is a sham and I feel like this is how a lot of people in our country feel - cheated, bored, lonely with only the catharsis of violence to look forward to.  I would've liked to have read the edition that also has his other book, Miss Lonelyhearts, as I think the two together would've been interesting for comparing the arc of development in in West's theory of the American Dream, as he grew older."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Saw this recommended by Paul Theroux and I am really glad I read it.
