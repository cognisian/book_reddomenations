It was hard to follow the characters and who was who as time went by but I think I got it.  It was an interesting way to weave around history in the stories of each character.  I enjoyed this book and do recommend it.  It was a slow read for me though..but so much depth to it.

I find his books, and also those of Anthony Grey who writes of Far East countries/cities, so readable and one is reminded of so much of history that one has long forgotten.  Can really recommend his other books such as Paris."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is my third Rutherfurd novel this summer, and it is just as amazing as The Forest and Sarum.  I once had a history prof who used to say that you can learn more about history from a well written novel than from reading a history book.  For example, never yet read a better explanation of the persecution of the Huguenots than Mr Rutherfurd's.  He is consistently amazing."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Truly enjoyed the timeline from start to finish.
