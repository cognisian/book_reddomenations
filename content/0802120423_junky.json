Junk is not a kick. It is a way of life.\r\n\r\nIn his debut novel, Junky, Burroughs fictionalized his experiences using and peddling heroin and other drugs in the 1950s into a work that reads like a field report from the underworld of post-war America. The Burroughs-like protagonist of the novel, Bill Lee, see-saws between periods of addiction and rehab, using a panoply of substances including heroin, cocaine, marijuana, paregoric (a weak tincture of opium) and goof balls (barbiturate), amongst others. \r\n\r\nFor this definitive edition, renowned Burroughs scholar Oliver Harris has gone back to archival typescripts to re-created the author's original text word by word. From the tenements of New York to the queer bars of New Orleans, Junky takes the reader into a world at once long-forgotten and still with us today. Burroughs\u2019s first novel is a cult classic and a critical part of his oeuvre.", "asin": "0802120423", "rank": "57754", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616nbkV0aFL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
