I also loved Monique's other book \"The White Woman on the Green Bicycle\". I guess the truth is I'm sick of books that are too ... feminine. I'm a woman, but I'm tired of everything being all flowery and everyone going on and on about their feelings. Not that Monique doesn't delve into the feelings of the characters, because you know exactly how each of them feels, what losses/challenges they're experiencing, etc. But she's got a good dose of masculine energy in her writing which is refreshing to me. I'm not sure how else to describe it.Monique's descriptions of what it's like to be alone out at sea were exceptional. I really feel like I got it, even though I've never had the experience. Worth the money!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This novel was alright. I kept hoping it would get exciting, and climax but it just didn't happen.
