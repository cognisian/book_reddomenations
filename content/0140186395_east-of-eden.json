The writing is \u201csimple\u201d and easy to read, but the thoughts and depth are both real and raw. We know little about Cain and Abel in the Bible story, but I suspect this gives some insight into both the brothers. One \u201cgood\u201d but far from perfect, the other \u201cbad\u201d but as much from circumstance and poor timing as from evil intent (although the latter does exist at times). They both pay for it in their own way."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book had some of the most odious characters and themes I have ever read. I found myself, at first, hating it, but still captivated by the story. The last third or so, I found certain characters to be more endearing and their purposes more significant. I was still on the fence as to my true opinion until the last page. Once I read the final word of the novel (which wouldn\u2019t make sense unless you read the rest) I felt the entire work not only redeemed, but highly recommendable."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Spellbinding.couldn't put it down.

Set in the rich farmland of California's Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families\u2014the Trasks and the Hamiltons\u2014whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.\r\n\r\nThe masterpiece of Steinbeck\u2019s later years, East of Eden is a work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. Adapted for the 1955 film directed by Elia Kazan introducing James Dean and read by thousands as the book that brought Oprah\u2019s Book Club back, East of Eden has remained vitally present in American culture for over half a century.", "asin": "0140186395", "rank": "3312", "city": "Monterey", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gcQhUb-yL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
