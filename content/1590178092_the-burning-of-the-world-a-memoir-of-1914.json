The 20th century saw maybe the worst of it \u2013 although only by degrees. The First World War, the 2nd \u2013 the cold war, gulags and concentration camps and mass starvation, a war against not only the body but also the mind. The shattering of Yugoslavia \u2013 pieces flying every which way. The Armenians \u2013 nobody ever talks about them, do they? Not politically correct, I suppose, to mention that genocide.We in America are obsessed with World War II. It\u2019s probably the grotesqueness of Hitler, the darkness of Nazism, the flagrant evil that didn\u2019t bother to hide. Slaughter, cold and heartless and mechanized. But the reality is that World War I was more existential for Europe. While WWII was about despotism and tyranny, the First World War was the remaking of an old order. The redrawing of boundaries, the fall of dynasties, the final destruction of the \u201cSick Man of Europe\u201d. Setting the table for all the geopolitical messes for a hundred years \u2013 messes we are still dealing with, like Turkey and Palestine and Syria and Jordan. The House of Saud.But these epic tales of nations are carved all by individual men. We like to think of those men as Churchill or Stalin or Roosevelt \u2013 of \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d. But those are just the names we remember. Most are forgotten; \u201cuncounted lives that are buried without drums and trumpets under the foundations of monumental successes\u201d as Joseph Conrad says.\u201cThe Burning of the World: A Memoir of 1914\u201d is about that. It\u2019s the story of Bela Zombory, a poor Hungarian painter and his first year of war. Drafted into the army, he\u2019s forced to the front to fight the Russians \u2013 always the Russians. He is injured, and is returned to Budapest to recover. It\u2019s his story \u2013 a short story, simple and uncomplicated. But not plain \u2013 full of the emotions of a man who does not want to fight, nor does he want to die. It is not a treatise against great powers \u2013 it is not a diatribe against war \u2013 it is not a self-serving heroic autobiography. It\u2019s just a story of a boy, an artist, and his first year of war.If you are intrigued by Europe and the wars. If you are a student of war. And if you are a reader \u2013 you\u2019ll enjoy \u201cThe Burning of the World.\u201d"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "An interesting perspective on WWI from a young artist drafted in the Hungarian army early in the war.He is skeptical from the start.

Good service from supplier."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "\u201cThe Burning of the World\u201d a non-fiction work by Bela Zombory-Moldoran (1885-1967) is short, beautiful and sad.  The story is told in the first person and is a memoir by the artist Bela Zombory-Moldovan.  Even with zero knowledge or understanding of the Hungarian language, I sense that the translation is excellent. It was assembled and translated by the grandson, Peter. Read the book first, and then go back and read the Introduction.It is a rare thing, indeed, to find in a war story such flowing, colorful, glorious prose, as here where the reader is treated to a panoply of sounds, smells, feelings, food, and --- especially \u2013 colors, as only a painter can render.Bela goes to war in the first weeks of WWI as a junior officer in the Hungarian military. He is wounded rather severely not many weeks later, while serving in Galicia, fighting the Russians. Today no doubt his diagnosis would include PTSD.  He is a symbol of Old Europe and a victim of the absolute unpreparedness of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire for the disaster that the war and its outcomes bring, including not many years later by the second disaster of WWII, and Hungary\u2019s shrinkage and virtual disappearance.It isn\u2019t so much the story of the war\u2019s beginning and eventual stalemate that is impressive. In fact, the political discussions held from time to time by Bela with relatives, friends and colleagues, are among the least interesting, least intellectually cogent aspects of this excellent book.  What the reader sees and feels instead is the old culture, the geography, the Adriatic Sea, the mountains, the change of seasons, the battlefield, and the man \u2013 Bela --who loses himself and his anchor in life as a result of his brief stint of wartime gunbattle. We see family and tradition, caring and pathos, joy and sadness.  Lacking entirely is any suggestion of sexuality or romance.  This is, essentially, an asexual story. But there is a palpable closeness between and among the people who come to life in the grandson\u2019s re-creation of this book in English, from a hand-written original manuscript on old, yellowed scrap-paper.Read it for the sensuality of feelings and color. He\u2019s at his best when on a train. Read it if only to enjoy good writing, but also to understand an often-forgotten chapter in the awful history that was World War I.A 5, for sure."}]}, "authors": ["Bela Zombory-Moldovan"], "isbn": "1590178092", "longitude": 19.0404707, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "The Burning of the World: A Memoir of 1914", "word_cloud": "write young aspire artist conscript austrian hungarian army outbreak poignant unique view people theater operation experience first hand account typically deal western find fascinate historically personal depth writer observation unit decimate russian army early conflict return home try adjust new reality short work deserves wide readership war brewing year centuries millennium word repeat farmer peasant priest citizen mercenary noble war forever century saw maybe worst degree cold war gulag concentration camp mass starvation war body also mind shatter piece fly way nobody ever talk not politically correct suppose mention obsess probably grotesqueness darkness flagrant evil bother hide cold heartless mechanize reality existential despotism tyranny remake old order redrawing boundary fall dynasty final destruction table geopolitical mess year mess still deal epic tale nation carve individual men like think men name remember most forgotten uncounted life bury drum trumpet foundation monumental success story poor painter first year war army force front fight always injure return recover story short story simple uncomplicated plain full emotion man want fight want die treatise great power diatribe war heroic autobiography story boy artist first year intrigue war student war interesting perspective young artist draft hungarian army early skeptical start wound first engagement experience harrow evacuation to hospital display recognize classic symptom unfortunately memoirs incomplete end month interest account day lead first month war so much confusion much unknown account author first experience battle reveal short work much read feeling entire generation young men march north foot kill maimed russian artillery shell not even imaginable hungarian cry baby first person narrative favorite wartime perspectives focus actual war nature society war role return love write wonderfully evocative charm melancholy account serene way life vanish talented artist life irreparably damage deserves far greater audience war scenes are esp valuable unusual glimpse eastern front infrequently cover highlight massive bungling huge confusion lead totally unsurprising obliteration empire fine add ever grow collection material service supplier work short beautiful sad story tell first person artist even knowledge understand hungarian language sense translation excellent assemble translate grandson first back rare thing indeed find war story flow colorful glorious prose treat panoply sound smell feeling food especially color painter go war first week junior officer hungarian military wound rather severely many week later serve fight doubt diagnosis symbol victim absolute unpreparedness disaster war outcome bring include many year later second disaster shrinkage virtual much story war begin eventual stalemate impressive fact political discussion hold time time relatives friend colleague least interest least intellectually cogent aspect excellent see feel instead old culture geography mountains season man lose anchor life result brief stint wartime gun battle see family tradition care pathos joy sadness entirely suggestion sexuality romance essentially asexual story palpable closeness people come life grandson original manuscript old yellow sensuality feeling color best train enjoy good writing also understand chapter awful history sure", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "WWI"], "summary": "New York Review Books Classics\r\n  \r\nThe budding young Hungarian artist B\u00e9la Zombory-Moldov\u00e1n was on holiday when the First World War broke out in July 1914.
