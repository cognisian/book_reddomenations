As it happened, after putting the book down, I began at p. 70, when Hadrian\u2019s future teeters between possible early death and possible elevation to emperor.  After reading to the end, I then began again at the beginning.  Since much of the early pages are devoted to Hadrian reflecting on his life, and on old age, I rather like this approach to the book. This book could be read as a tutorial on leadership.  Hadrian was ambitious, ruthless and devious when necessary, hungry for experiences of all kinds, loyal when possible, self-deprecating but also prideful.  He enjoyed life, both its pleasures, and his acts of self-discipline and courage.  He appealed to Yourcenar, as she states, in part because he brought peace and prosperity (and security) to Rome; one must credit those people lusting after power who then have admirable goals for what to do with it once obtained. \u201cEach time that I have looked from afar, at the bend of some sunny road, toward a Greek acropolis with its perfect city fixed to a hill liked a flower to a stem, I could not but feel that the incomparable plant was limited by its very perfection, achieved on one point of space and in one segment of time. Its sole chance of expansion, as for that of a plant, was in its seed; with the pollen of its ideas Greece has fertilized the world.  But Rome, less light and less shapely, sprawling to the plain at her river\u2019s edge, was moving toward vaster growth: the city has become the State.\u201d"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "An interesting portrait of Hadrian and Roman culture, but not a way to learn the details of historical events."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "In the form of an unlikely deathbed letter to 'Mark,' Yourcenar attributes to Hadrian much of the philosophy generally credited to his successor, Marcus Aurelius. It's exceedingly well thought out, researched  and organized. In spite of the unlikely venue Yourcenar succeeds better than any author in memory to put the reader into the mindset of her protagonist. She adds imagination to an otherwise non-fiction account.The historical reminiscence starts with the Senate encircling the hard pressed Domitian, reminding us of the trials of Donald Trump. It's a good insight into the starting point of the retreat from maximum extent under Trajan. We see Hadrian's wall in Britain and the retreat from Parthia. There is extensive coverage of the homosexual association with the young slave Antinous, deified after death and accorded the name of an Egyptian city. Hadrian contemplates the succession, past and present. He observes both politics and culture migrating away from a center in Rome, a preview of the thrust of empire culminating in Constantine. His fascination with Athens as a center of culture will evolve to the Greek nature of the empire, a preview of the Byzantine Empire. In contemplation of religion, Hadrian deplores persecution of Christians and sees the Jewish revolt putting the first cracks in the, soon to end, Pax Romana.Yourcenar provides a great jumping off point for Gibbons' 'Decline and Fall.'"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Marguerite Yourcenar (1903 - 1987) who was writing her works in French has produced widely acclaimed book entitled ''The memoirs of Hadrian''. I have to admit that this is a very well researched novel from the historical fiction genre. Author did her homework and she started writing this book being very well prepared. As a reader I have to praise Mrs. Yourcenar for all of her efforts that she made to write this historical novel with very high professionalism.Moreover I cannot agree with the negative depiction of the Hadrian's predecessor Emperor Trajan, who is presented in the novel as a ruler obsessed only with new conquests that have devastating impact on the Roman state. Trajan was officially declared by the Senate and his contemporaries as ''Optimus Princeps'' what means ''The Best Ruler'' and one knows that such titles do not come for free. The reign of Trajan was very unique in comparison to the reigns of other emperors in the first centuries AD. He was very much successful soldier-emperor who significantly extended the borders of the Roman state. Unfortunately Hadrian resigned from the eastern acquisitions of his predecessor immediately after he was appointed as the following emperor.This well-researched book on one of my favourite Roman Emperors deserves a praise due to its professionalism, but not due to its style. Because of the way how it is written I must admit that ''The memoirs of Hadrian'' by Marguerite Yourcenar is not the best book on antiquity I have ever read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It a forgotten classic.
