Too much description, not enough narrative punch, plot moves as slowly as cold molasses, cheesy dialogue.  Perhaps the author had pretensions of taking up where George Simenon left off with his marvelous Magritte novels  (Simenon stopped writing in 1973), with this meandering tale of a French detective covering one of Montreal's seedy areas.  Unfortunately, it comes off as third-rate Simenon.  Even the weakest or lame of the Magritte novels is a far more enjoyable read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Trvanian is a great writer."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I keep coming back to this book every couple of years.

It is a world where violence and brutality are a way of life. To the people of the Main, police lieutenant Claude LaPointe is judge and jury, father confessor and avenging angel. \r\n\r\nMontreal\u2019s police force has changed over time, but LaPointe has not. His commitment to justice is total, as is his devotion to the Main and its underworld community. But when a cold-blooded murderer invades LaPointe\u2019s territory, he is forced to examine his long-held beliefs and secrets and to confront his own loneliness and mortality. With a cast of unforgettable supporting characters and an unusual and remarkable hero, The Main is another gripping tale of death and danger, of action and mystery, by the incomparable Trevanian.\r\n", "asin": "1400098238", "rank": "787546", "city": "Montreal", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Btd5GnWKL.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
