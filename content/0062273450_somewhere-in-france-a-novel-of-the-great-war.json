Her parents, the Earl and Countess of Cumberland, thought there were ways for a proper lady to help without getting her hands dirty, but for Elizabeth (Lilly) that was not enough, so she enlisted in the WAACS and ended up driving an ambulance at the front in France. After being recognized by a soldier who had been a footman at Buckingham Palace, she was astounded at peoples\u2019 reactions, both good and bad, to finding an aristocrat in their midst. The other WAAC drivers were enthralled with the thought that, as a child, she was one of the children brought to the palace to play with the Prince of Wales. Lilly\u2019s surprise, on the other hand, was the effect that all of this had on her love life."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I enjoyed this book  immensely! I have read many historically-based novels with the romance worked into the facts and this one was perfect"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is a period novel set at the beginning of World War I.  It involves a privileged British girl who wants more from life than parties and marrying well.  It is historically factual regarding the lives of British royalty and their families.  Women during this time period were considered practically worthless.  Many times they were not educated beyond the basic task of learning to read.  This book focuses on the struggles of women who want more out of their life.  It details the struggles of two particular women, Lilly and Charlotte.  Lilly is a \"lady\" and, as such, is expected to do one thing and one thing only, marry well.  Charlotte is her tutor, a university-educated women, who helps her look outside the box her family is determined to keep her in.  Lilly falls in love with a friend of her brother, Edward.  However, he is not considered suitable or worthy of Lilly by her family.  Edward and his friend, Robbie, enlist and are sent to the front lines of World War I.  What I particularly liked about this book was the the war was pretty thoroughly discussed with no holds barred on the savageness of the first world war.  It made me have a deeper appreciation of the men and women who served in this war to end all wars.  I would definitely recommend this book for your reading enjoyment.  It is a fairly easy read, short chapters, good for reading a little at a time.  However, once I started reading it, I couldn't get back to it fast enough."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Loved it!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The freedom to choose your own destiny is seeded deeply into our souls. Lille was some one who lived  deeply not just in love, but in life. She was someone we would have all wanted to identify with during the time of this setting. Excellent read if you want to have your heart captivated."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "An impeccably paced, compelling tale of love between classes in a fully realized Great War setting. Robson's depictions of the horrors of everyday life as a field surgeon and an ambulance driver on the front are unflinching without crossing the line into gratuitous violence. The romance is handled realistically, deftly, and with great empathy. A great book for readers of historical fiction. I'll note that while this is part of a series, I think the books can be read in any order and each stands on their own."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very good read -- seemed to captured both female and male characters quite weel with some very realistic discussion of why those who experience war prefer not to speak of it -- primarily, so others will not have to suffer. Nice insight. Well worth the read. Very well rounded protaganist in the upper class lady becoming a centered young woman."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very informative background of World War I.
