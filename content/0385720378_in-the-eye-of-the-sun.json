For anyone who wants to learn what the life of the educated middle and upper middle class women in the Middle East really is, and not the stereotypes, there is no better book.Ms Soueif made me feel that someone finally gave my life experience a voice; that I wasn't lost anymore in the in between of what people think Egyptian women are and how they think that all those who deviate from that group, are all westernized in brain and soul and happy for it. She expressed the voice of strong, independent and highly educated women in the Middle East, whose love for their homeland is their identity, their root and their soul."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "You know a book is great when it reains with you for years.

It is lengthy and there is not really a plot to rush the reader along. It's politically interesting, for one, and gets inside the soul and psychology of its narrator. I struggled with parts but was really pleased I persisted.It is told by Asya. We meet her as a bright young child in an educated family in Cairo. We follow her progress to university -  an emotionally heightened time of activism and eventual disillusion for a generation of young Egyptians.The greater part of the novel continues to follow her life after graduation. But she does not go where most western writers would take her - into the arms of a lover - but into the pages of a good book.SPOILER ALERTThere is an affair of love, for sure, but not quite as you might expect. For Saif - his name - love is not about taking and possessing, but giving. He demands little of Asya. It is hard not to admire Saif, but perhaps he is hard to love. His personal response to the crisis in his country is quite different from that of Asya. Indeed we can only guess at what he is really doing. We do know he is not cheating on Asya.We encounter him always in her thoughts but rarely in her company. Is this love?Academic work takes her to England, to Lancaster University as she pursues a doctorate in linguistics [the \"good book\"]. It is bleak and lonely and cold. She finds some warmth in the charms of another man - for him love is possession. Her generosity of spirit finds some rewards in his bed only. He is a bad choice, if she has indeed chosen or just accepted. Indeed, the degree to which Asya has taken control of her life or been swept by the currents of her fate is a recurrent theme.Asya's PhD is on metaphor. She is told by her tutor that she must control her interest in the romance of form to focus on the laws of syntax. This she accomplishes in her thesis but not in her life.Many topics are covered by Ahdaf Soueif - the Middle East [not from the vantage of Washington or Tel Aviv], the position of women in the Arab world, the choices for intellectual and intelligent women in modern life. I will remember it above all for the love between Asya and Saif, despite it not conforming to ordinary ideas of a love story. I think it is a difficult book, but ultimately rewarding - can that stand as a metaphor for the narrator's life?"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Heartbreaking story. Gives a detailed insight into the lives of women living in Afghanistan. Beautifully written. The plot well planned and developed. I shed a few tears I have to admit."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The part I liked most was the piece about how the author tries to translate and explain an Egyptian song full of innuendos and culture dependents to an English audience, it was hilarious and instructive. The personal account is OK, the parts happening in England were tedious but I liked reading the Egyptian parts, especially as an Israeli whose father came to Israel from Egypt. The book is too long, but I understand it's her debut novel. Will read her other work."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "So where should start from ?!The novel presents life between 1967 to 1980 in the middle east moving to Europe ..  so in the back ground ; we see the historical events that took place in that period ,Egypt , the wars with Israel , Palestine  ..Jordan ..Lebanon , Saudi Arabia , Syria & Iran . the political transformation From Naser to Sadat , all the detailed changes : economically , socially , culture & even in Urban patterns .While on the front layer we see the life of a family & their surroundings , through them we meet Muslims , Christians , leftists , servants , farmers , workers , the Elite .. westernized people and the fundamentalists rising. we also see the traditions ,religion ideologies , taboos , and all what concerns women , Ahdaf describes everything in so much details !the novel's main core is based around Asya , her life between Egypt & England in that critical period , with her eyes we adore Egypt and in the same time  get introduced to England And travel to different European countries , one of the most interesting parts to me was the comparison between the life of the Nile and the life of the Thames !In Asya's ten years journey towards maturity : we live love , romance , passion , sexuality , compassion , humiliation , abuse , failure , infidelity , regrets , bitterness , breaking down & loss !! I can not meet a personality like Asya every day with all her contradictions that present the Cultural duality values she has , but when I read Ahdaf's biography I felt that Asya is - some how - part of her , specially in her relation with her mother & her childhood , also I can see that one of Asya's friends in the novel seems to be inspired by Radwa Ashour - who is one of Ahdaf's friends-and her husband Mourid Barghouti (auther of I saw Ramallah) , this gives more reality to the atmosphere ..Honestly , I hesitated at first to rate it as 5 (not because it does not deserve it) but because I thought I could not rate it as (The map of love) that captured my heart , while (In the eye of the sun) really.. really hurt my stomach With its tragedy ! beside I was very much annoyed by Asya in some parts ... true I loved her ..loved her descriptions & meditation , I sympathized with her, cried with her , loved Saif with her & understood her reasons for her behavior ; but I could not justify her behavior or her cruelty to herself before anybody else !But I decided to rate it as 5 because of Ahdaf that manage so cleverly to prevent me from letting this 800 pages book down before finishing it !! her so much full of life characters , her brilliant way that expressed human feelings & weakness , for the metaphors she used and specially for the last part of the book ! wow - It is the most painful one but so powerful : the conformations between Asya & Saif , Asya & her mother ..Asya & the mirror ..then Asya & the memories !! also the way she discussed Islam & traditions , the translations of Quraan , and from anther side Om Kulthom's songs , this was an unforgettable book !"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Though the protagonist of this novel comes from a priveleged background and is pursuing a Ph.D. in an arcane corner of English literature through most of the story -- all of which means that she is not exactly an Egyptian \"everywoman\" -- the intimate view of her life, her thinking and the social controls on both was fascinating. And more than an anthopological adventure, it was a reflection on how different cultural values can shape a life story.The real dramatic trigger in this story was the impossibility of an healing conversation between her husband and her about the \"elephant in the room\" in their marriage. Both of them are intelligent, educated, cosmopolitan people who functioned like Westerners in business and academia. But in their personal relationships, they exist in a Muslim construct (however apparently modernized it may be) in which men's and women's roles are separated and non-negotiable.The tension between the traditionalism of their family lives, modernity of the \"outside\" lives, the dramatic events and changing politics of the Egypt and the Middle East, the vivid descriptions of everyday events contrasted with discussions of government figures, all add up to a evocative and often mesmerizing rendition of another kind of life. But not so different that we don't understand and sympathize with every character. Well, almost every character. Just one, an attractive Englishman who becomes very important to the story eventually turns out to be a whiny sort of sociopath. Very scary guy, and one our endlessly courteous and empathic heroine had no idea of how to handle. (Most of us Western girls would have recognized the type and gotten rid of him pretty quickly.)I enjoyed this book. It was not a quick read, but I kept making time for it. I read the last 200 pages in one session, because I couldn't put it down. I had a little difficulty at first with the unfamiliar names, but the characters were so well-defined that I caught on quickly.. This book is not plot-driven as other reviewers have observed. But it definitely has a plot and periods of suspense that are simiply agonizing. Perhaps reads more like a memoire, a walk through the arc of someone's life, sampling the important moments that eventually changed everything.And in the course of this book, things do change. Especially for this woman. She is almost too perfect at the beginning, beautiful, well-to-do, in control of her decisions and her dreams. At the end, she is real. Life has challenged her cultural training, and she has made choices that are impossible to live with unless she changes at the level of belief, motivation and expectations. It's hard for her, and we travel through this minefield with her.I wish there were another book, telling us where she goes from the end of this story. But in the meantime I recommend it highly."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "If you want to be taken on a journey through the middle east in the mind of one (somewhat neurotic) Egyptian female, from birth to death and dying, love, engagement, marriage, intellectual striving, poetry, rose, and a touch of Islam and Christianity, you will enjoy reading this detailed account of Asya's life and the perspective she has on her immediate wealthy Egyptian family culture and the often fleeting moments of apathy she has for others in her immediate view."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Her eyes fixed firmly on the future, Asya Ulama makes a mess of her present in Soueif's novel of love and cultural clash.Asya's story begins in 1979, in London, and ends shortly afterwards, back home in Cairo. In between is the story of Asya's coming-of-age from the blossoming of her first love during the time of the '67 War with Israel, through her education and marriage, continued education and separation.Asya's parents are both professors at Cairo University; she grows up speaking English and is expected to study abroad, obtain her doctorate and become a professor herself. At the same time her family and culture is highly patriarchal. A friend is withdrawn from University by her father for walking alone with a young man. Asya's curfew until she is betrothed is 7 p.m.Yet she goes alone to Italy to study for a summer. And later, after her marriage to gentle, urbane, cynical and world-weary Saif, she travels to England for her doctorate while he builds up his business in Syria.Asya's life is shaped by the expectations of others. Both hemmed in and bolstered by her family relationships, her loneliness in England is paralyzing. Although her doctoral subject bores her she slogs on -- her family expects it, her parents would be disgraced at the University if she failed.Meanwhile her marriage is foundering on shoals of sexuality. Misunderstanding and total lack of communication leave her a virgin after several years as a wife. Finally, in an act she knows to be as self-destructive as it is liberating, she takes a lover. The emotional pitch of the book becomes shrill and Asya's meandering search for meaning in her life becomes more and more short-sighted until all her actions are defensive.Souief's long passages of punishing dialogue -- harangues from Asya's lover and Asya's husband, Asya's self-flagellating responses -- exhaust the reader. And roiling beneath the surface are political currents -- the Palestinian cause, the rise of Muslim Fundamentalism, government corruption.With fully engaging characters -- even the minor players are real -- Souief, an Egyptian living in London, has created a sweeping, thought-provoking novel focused on an inevitable collision of cultures and the plight of women caught in the middle."}]},

detailed, richly textured novel impeccably recreates the milieus of Cairo, London and English university life as it recounts the maturing of Asya, a beautiful Egyptian who, by her own admission, \"feels more comfortable with art than with life.\" \r\n\r\nSoueif, a Londoner making her American debut, tells Asya's story cinematically, beginning in 1979 and going back to 1967, with chapters formally divided into scenes and a plethora of flashbacks, flash-forwards and different perspectives. During the course of those years, Asya, daughter of an intellectual Cairo family, falls in love with and marries Saif, a highly successful computer expert who indulges her with considerable luxuries. \r\n\r\nBut the marriage is plagued by sexual problems; going to England to pursue a doctorate, Asya eventually takes up with Gerald, a pseudo-sensitive boor studying marketing. Finally, her marriage over, she returns to a very different and less hospitable Cairo than the one in which she grew up to begin a teaching career about which she is, at best, ambivalent. \r\n\r\nThe author invests scenes of childhood with the burnished glow of fond memory; these are among the most poignant passages here. Her impressive and only slightly overlong novel, with its acutely observed vision of male-female relations as a series of complex power struggles, suggests the emergence of a major new talent.
