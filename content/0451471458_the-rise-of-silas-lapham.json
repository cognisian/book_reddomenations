Silas Lapham is a man of conscience who fully realizes his folly; but he is also an ambitious man who lets his aspirations lead him to risk both his fortune and his family\u2019s happiness for status in a society that will never truly accept him.\r\n \r\n\u201cHis perceptions were sure, his integrity was absolute,\u201d wrote Henry Seidel Canby of William Dean Howells, whom he credited as being \u201cresponsible for giving the American novel form.\u201d", "asin": "0451471458", "rank": "628145", "city": "Boston", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Y6YcdnF3L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
