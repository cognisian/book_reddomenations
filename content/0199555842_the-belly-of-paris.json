The result is one of Zola\u2019s more masterful stories filled with intricate subplots that cause the reader to have ever-changing allegiances and impressions about the characters.Zola was a master of descriptive writing. In The Belly of Paris he creates scenes that the reader can see, feel, taste and, most impressively, smell the market, all of which are integral to the story. As in many of his stories, hypocritical, vicious gossip does much to drive the narrative. The highlight in this novel is a scene in which Zola intertwines the voices of the women at the market with the stench of the cheeses surrounding them as their chattering sets off the events that lead to the inevitable conclusion. As the \u201cgreat explosion of smells\u201c combined, \u201cThe stench rose and spread, no longer a collection of individual smells, but a huge, sickening mixture. It seemed for a moment that it was the vile words of Madame Lec\u0153ur and Mademoiselle Saget that had produced this dreadful odour.\u201dUnlike many of the other novels I\u2019ve read in the Rougon-Macquart cycle, the first part of the story is filled with sympathetic characters. Reading on, it was like a being in a constant, unbalanced state and compelled me to keep reading. The Belly of Paris would be a great starting point for anyone interested in learning about Zola\u2019s writing."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I usually like Zola's writing but could not really find the center of interest in this novel. His protagonist returns to Paris after a long absence and his brother has taken over the bakery and married a dominant wife. The protagonist is not in himself interesting. HIs surroundings are interesting. I have to finish the book and hope I do. I got a little depressed at the lack of life in the main character."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "We read this book for our annual gastronomic December book club meeting.

He finds the city changed beyond recognition. The old Marche des Innocents has been knocked down as part of Haussmann's grand programme of urban reconstruction to make way for Les Halles, the spectacular new food markets. Disgusted by a bourgeois society whose devotion to food is inseparable from its devotionto the Government, Florent attempts an insurrection. Les Halles, apocalyptic and destructive, play an active role in Zola's picture of a world in which food and the injustice of society are inextricably linked. \r\n\r\nThe Belly of Paris (Le Ventre de Paris) is the third volume in Zola's famous cycle of twenty novels, Les Rougon-Macquart. It introduces the painter Claude Lantier and in its satirical representation of the bourgeoisie and capitalism complements Zola's other great novels of social conflict and urban poverty", "asin": "0199555842", "rank": "438918", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515sF0gEtFL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
