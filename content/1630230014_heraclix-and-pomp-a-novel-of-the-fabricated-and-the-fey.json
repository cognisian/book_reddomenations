Heraclix is now alive, a reanimated man sewn together from numerous other parts, but with no memory of his former life he finds himself wondering what kind of person he could have been. And Pomp who believed herself immortal, finds herself questioning that status after being nearly killed by a rather nasty necromancer.Quite literally thrown together by the necromancer, the two set off to find new meaning in their lives. Heraclix wants to know how and why this was done to him and what kind of man he was before. With her new found mortality, Pomp tries to wrestle with the language and the meaning behind that word. As they travel across Europe, with a side trip to Hell, the two discover the necromancer they thought dead is very much alive and has plans to ensure his own immortality.Though the premise was interesting and the summary on the flap of the book drew me in; it pains me to say, dear reader, that I did not enjoy this book. It has glowing reviews on Amazon as well as other sites, but alas it does not have one from me. Perhaps it is because this is a very dense book, it became quite complex at times. Or perhaps it was because several of the characters had similar or near identical names which made it difficult to keep track of who was who.Whatever it was, I found myself slogging through this book and not liking it. Several times I wanted to put it down and not finish it, yet I persevered. I only finished the book because I wanted to know if I was correct in guessing how certain plot points would be resolved \u2013 I was correct in my thoughts and what I surmised would happen did happen.I never enjoy giving a negative review on anything, whether it be a book, music, etc. You, dear reader, might enjoy it despite my words.

Shortly before finishing it I asked myself why, and I think I've got the answer. This excellent story, the first I've read by Forrest Aguirre, is  one of the most descriptive pieces I've read in quite some time. Scarcely anything Aguirre shows you in this story lacks for a description, and some of the details are strikingly imaginative. As is the plot, which starts out as a simple quest for knowledge, yet develops some beautiful twists and turns along the way, long after you've stopped pestering the air around your reading chair with enquiries like \"what, exactly, was that foul sorcerer up to and why does Heraclix want to uncover the painful secrets the sly magician left behind?\". You stop asking, and file the questions in the back of your mind, because the book is such a joy to read, and the characters so engrossing. Aguirre just sets Heraclix the golem and Pomp the fairy on their path, and keeps showing and showing until, when he suddenly answers one of the questions you'd almost forgotten you'd tucked away, that cleverly revealed bit of telling resonates like a smartly rung bell, and keeps resonating until he tells you the next thing. Aguirre so deftly turns the storytelling adage  \"show, don't tell\" into \"show and tell\" that you hardly notice. If I'm trying too hard to be a little too clever here, it's because I have a serious case of storytelling envy going. For me, that's the best kind of story there is.  Heraclix and Pomp sits firmly in one of the most difficult to define niches around: \"Wierd fiction\". The wierd is tough to describe, but easy to recognize when you see it. And this one is a fine example that simultaneously delights and unsettles the reader. While doing so, it begs to be sipped and savored. Barrel on through at your own risk."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "\u201dHe remembered nothing of what came before the womb, though he felt intimations from that pre-existent time that he wouldn\u2019t quite form into full realizations. As the will to live slowly fused with his nascent consciousness, his heart, brain, and eyes awakened. Immediately, questions, and his awareness grew:Who am I?I am I.Where am I?I am here.What is here?It is where I am.What is where?And so forth.\u201dMost of us after the inconvenience of being squeezed out of the womb, kicking and screaming, do find that we now have to cry (sing) for our food. We have, as a bonus though, inherited at least one rather large servant and possibly two that seem inordinately concerned about our well being. They slave away for us for many years and then slowly ease us into wiping our own arse, finding our own food, and in extreme cases they actually send us out to earn a living and to pay our own bills.This was not the case for Heraclix.He was conceived through necromancy. He is not a baby, but a massive man standing head and shoulders above the tallest man. One look in a mirror or a pool of stagnant water would show him that he is not by any stretch of the imagination going to get by on his looks. He is a golem, a stitched together creature, \u201da calico quilt of flesh\u201d.He is Mowler\u2019s Monster.\u201dThink that you are not yet begotten, that you are in the womb, that you are young, that you are old, that you have died, that you are in the world beyond the grave; grasp in your thought all of this at once...then you can apprehend God.\u201d Hermes Trismegistus, HermeticaHeraclix has a lot of questions, but God never enters the equation. Now the door to Hell, well, it was wide open.\u201dBeelzebub, Lord of Flies. Below the neck, it was dressed sharply---all frills and gaudy lace under a dark purple riding coat. ITs claws showed from under the sleeves, needle-like and dripping green venom. The insectile demonic eyes confused the onlookers, so that everyone in the room--Heraclix, Pomp, and the sorcerer--thought that the demon was looking his, her, and his way, respectively. The demon\u2019s proboscis, however, pointed directly at the sorcerer.\u201dFor most of us when we are first born we aren\u2019t promptly introduced to the Lord of the Underworld. Heraclix makes his acquaintance even before the blood and the other juices of the womb can be shaken from his body.Anybody ever been trying to read and had a fly buzzing in the window behind your head? Take that times a thousand and you\u2019ll have an idea of the level of annoying noise that Beelzebub is capable of.Now as Heraclix is flopping around trying to get his bearings there is also Pomp, a fairy, whose special blood is necessary to complete whatever insidious plans Mowler has for Heraclix.\u201dInstantaneous invisibility, dragonfly wings, and a quiver full of potent arrows--along with a charming personality--are her assurances of everlasting life.\u201dShe is gullible, and easily tricked by the nice old man into becoming part of his experiment. She has no sense of time, only the present exists, and because that is probably one of the best gifts a person can receive, especially if they are happy by nature, she doesn\u2019t have to worry about a future because it stretches before her over hill and dale further than the eye can see. She can never possibly catch up with it.Mowler is left howling on his way to hell, after the Golem, through some spark of compassion, rescues Pomp from his clutches.It is tough, exasperating work being an Evil Genius.\u201dMowler, frustrated by the people\u2019z continued willful ignorance and their lack of recognition at his genius, left Prague for Vienna, ranting and raving about how he would call up the very powerz of Hell and rule the world if he had to sacrifice every living soul in the Holy Roman Empire to do it.\u201d The mayor paused for a moment. \u201cThey don\u2019t have much imagination, these sorcerers. They can be a bother.\u201dHeraclix and Pomp become unlikely travelling companions as they try to read the map of his body, the conglomeration of human parts, and discover who they once belonged to. In particular he is worried about the big blue hand that keeps trying to kill anyone that poses any level of threat to Heraclix. HANDY, but making more enemies than friends.Forrest Aguirre takes us on a journey through some of my favorite parts of the world, Vienna, Prague, Budapest, and Istanbul. He also takes us to my least favorite place to visit\u2026HELL.\u201dHe noticed that the worms were hauntingly familiar and peculiarly abnormal--not your normal annelids. They were, he realized, Hellspawn larvae, Lumbricus Hades, the souls of the damned beginning their migration through eternal torment. He saw their visages, millions of them bearing the face of their former selves, though the condemned wouldn\u2019t recognize themselves if held to a mirror, not at this stage. And even after they had grown back into an understanding of their past lives and sins, they would be unable to recognize their own reflections, having been so twisted and mangled by the mutations and excruciating torture inflicted on them by other souls further along in their \u2018progression\u2019 that their appearance and voices would only remain as a pathetic mockery, a caricature of the person they had chosen to become in mortality.\u201dI\u2019m marking HELL off my tour route. Forrest already took me there, luckily while still safely ensconced in my favorite reading chair. I was scorched around the edges, but relatively unharmed. I may have worms with the faces of the tormented in my next nightmare, but that will just give me more incentive to tread lightly in deepening my own bucket of sin.Aguirre is a lyrical writer who made a genre I rarely read into a surprisingly literate endeavor. Through the mismatched eyes of a Golem and the purity of a fairy we are able to look at the absurdity and the misguided wants and desires of what we do with our lives. The jadedness we acquire and nurture steals the innocence of others. We do this out of love, out of animosity, and the world each time loses a bit more luminous... splendor."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "a charming and swiftly-paced romp through 18th century Europe, featuring a fearsome but sweet golem and his skittish but brave fairy companion. painted with bright, vibrant colors with the not infrequent splash of darkness and blood. part picaresque and part uncertain quest. quest for a soul, quest for the meaning of existence? perhaps. and hey, they also visit Hell. yay for traveling and yay for unusual destinations!I liked the writing. Aguirre is a talented writer who is quite at home when detailing the odd and the strange in prose that is often equally odd and strange. I quite enjoyed the off-kilter directions that sentences sometimes went, the unusual phrasings, the quirky quality to the prose. the chapters from the fairy Pomp's perspective are in the present tense, which is a clever way to illustrate her unique view of the world. the writing is not perfect: there was some clumsiness here and there and a rather rushed feeling at the end - things that might have been fixed by a harsh taskmaster of an editor. but I'm not sure I would have wanted them fixed because the clumsiness blends in with the delightfulness in a way that is all of a piece. Aguirre is an idiosyncratic and stylish writer; I was pleasantly reminded of other smart, quirky, and sometimes flawed authors I've enjoyed. I admire those sorts of writers.I really liked the story. I haven't read any other books with this setting and it completely fascinated me. at times it felt like the best sort of travelogue - one from the distant past, set in places I've read about but have never actually immersed myself into when reading fiction. Aguirre has a certain way of describing places like old Prague, Vienna, and Istanbul... a light touch with the description, using just enough for me to feel like I was in the actual place. but the story is not only a travelogue - it has deeper, more emotional goals. Heraclix & Pomp is about two completely different people trying to figure out who they are and what they can be. there was such a tenderness in the depiction of Pomp and the golem Heraclix's journeys and their frequent soul-searching, their need to be good and kind and just. this is a book for adults, definitely, but there was a lovely purity to the underlying theme of the book that often made me feel like I was reading a fable for children."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "When his creator is killed, a golem named Heraclix leaves Vienna with a fairy named Pomp in tow in search of answers. Heraclix seeks the former life (or lives) of his constituent body parts and Pomp wants only to understand the human way of life. They travel to the Near East and back again with a short detour to hell. Will they ever find the answers they seek and will they like the answers they get?Heraclix and Pomp brings a lot of different elements to the table. It's part historical fiction, part fantasy, with some political intrigue thrown in. Forrest Aguirre's prose feels like a mix of Peter S. Beagle and Gene Wolfe to me, dense but with a certain poetic beauty to it.Heraclix, the dour golem, and Pomp, the curious fairy, go from one European locale to the next in their search for answers, encountering ghosts, demons, Turks, Romani, necromancers, as Heraclix slowly pieces together who his body parts used to belong to. Intrigued yet?Forrest's depiction of Hell was one of my favorite parts of the book. The Lord of the Flies and his minions were pretty grotesque. I wasn't a fan of the political intrigue at first but I was sucked in eventually.If you're looking for some beautifully-written fantasy that doesn't trod along all the familiar paths, you'll enjoy Heraclix and Pomp. Four out of five stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "\"...what were the origins of the many pieces of Heraclix? He was like a puzzle to himself, an unknown being or beings, self-aware, yet unaware of the individuals from whom he had been constructed.\"Where do we come from? Of what are we made? Who are we? How did we get to be who we are? Can we change? In the case of Heraclix, of the title, all the above apply. H is a big guy. Think Shrek with a bit less green. Usually the golem is a clay creature, but H is more of a group effort, being comprised of parts, a Frankenstein monster with better (than the film) motor skills, and a makeover. Heraclix is riven, as so many of us are, with a complicated nature. His is more physical in it's manifestation, though. With one arm in particular eager for action, he reminded me a bit of  Doctor Strangelove. In a nifty opening, he breaks out of a womb-like vat of liquid (not the last birth event in the book), and does what any newborn might do. He reads everything he can get his paws on. Doesn't know where the ability came from, but really, really wants to get a handle on his world, and comes across his maker's private, and very disturbing, notes.Mattatheus Mowler is not your garden variety sorcerer. Sure he's a few hundred years old, and is educated enough to animate dead parts, among other nifty tricks, but the boy has some serious ambition, not to mention an issue with aging, and is not to be messed with. That brimstone aroma that may be wrinkling your nose emanates the Faustian bargain he has made. He has a client list that would be the envy of any K Street operative. Of course, evil, connected genius or not, he is still human, more or less, and makes mistakes enough to allow for an actual contest. Not exactly your ideal re-animator, (or would that be assembler?)  as daddy dearest  rains blows and other abuse down on Heraclix's large frame with abandon. But one day MM brings a sweet young thing to the lab, in a jar.Pomp is a pixie with moxie. She encourages H to stand up for himself, and overcome the self-loathing that accompanies his beatings. Mowler has dark plans for her of the sacrificial sort, but the plan flies to pieces, the premises succumbs to fire (always a risk when dealing with hellspawn), and a dynamic dimorphic duo is made.The motive force here is Heraclix trying to find out who he actually is. With information gleaned from Mowler's premises, he and Pomp set off on a classic journey of self-discovery. They cover a fair piece of European landscape, beginning in Vienna, with stops in Prague, Istanbul, Budapest, and sundry locales in between. Along the way they pick up pieces of the puzzle, as in a video game, that lead them from place to place. The information is sometimes in the form of clues, in Mowler's papers, say, or in writing along the side of a coin. More often it is in the form of stories told by Gypsies, Cossacks, wizards, an old man in an obscure town, sundry characters they encounter in their quest. As the pair travel, together and separately, they gain knowledge.Heraclix comes across as a likeable hulk. He has a pure heart (whomever it might once have belonged to) and is an honest seeker after truth. In trying to discover his true identity he learns a thing or two\"...there was something in the quality of sorrow suffered at the hands of another that was different than the sorrow that one brought on others, whether through one's own stupidity and neglect or by intentional acts of hatred. The latter carried the sharpest stings of guilt, regret, self-berating...\"Pomp, while a very valuable partner, is not so much seeking truth herself as she is eager to help Heraclix. Hey, the big lug saved her, so she owes him. But she finds that she, as well, is challenged to consider her view of herself and the world.\"Her life isn't now about playing pranks all day every day. It isn't about not caring. All this playing pranks and not caring isn't fun any more. If she goes on like this, her life stays immortally, eternally...boring. Death is sad, but death makes life more worth living.\"In addition to H&P; there is a parallel story involving Holy Roman Empire royalty, a young lass, and a fair bit of intrigue.There are some images and themes that run throughout. Birth is addressed multiple times, in both a biological and baptismal way. Heraclix is very clearly being born by breaking out of a watery enclosure in an early scene. There is what might be seen as a baptism by fire, and later in the book, he has what seems another aqueous bursting through or two. History figures large here. Pomp, when we meet her, has no notion of it, not understanding the concept of memory. Heraclix cannot remember anything and wants to find out who he is. The tale is told in a historical context, offering a look at the feel, if not much of the detail, of tension between the Holy Roman Empire and its foreign enemies. Eternal life is addressed in the wizard's desire for it and in how Pomp, who has it, copes with and gives a lot of thought to the implications of life without end. Changing one's life is also addressed on multiple fronts. A killer becomes a healer. Pomp is faced with potentially changing her orientation as well, getting to see in person the questionable wages of all-fun-all -the-time.I am sure there are many references to folk tales I missed in here, but a visit to hell itself surely must conjure Dante. So be on the lookout for references to The Inferno.  And heading to the basement certainly seems in synch with a Campbellian structure.One of the things that most impressed me was the diversity and creativity of Aguirre's imagination. Heraclix alone is a marvelous concoction, but there are many more. Phantoms haunting the one who killed them, demonflies from Hell, a Godzilla-like Beelzebub, some carnivorous clover, fairies up to no good, a demonized crow, some magic mirrors, a telescope for seeing magic. The list is considerable and the creations quite fun. While some echo familiar elements of fantasy fiction, there is an added layer of the new that gives it all some real sparkle.Gripes were few. There are a fair number of characters, and it can be a bit tough at times keeping them straight. The ARC I read did not have a list of characters in it. I do not know if the final version might. I find it useful to make my own list as I read to help keep everyone straight. Also there was one escape I had a problem with.Aguirre has established himself as a top-drawer, award-winning editor of speculative fiction, and a seasoned writer of sci-fi as well. Heraclix and Pomp demonstrates that he is also a confident, creative and imaginative novelist.  The journey on which Heraclix and Pomp set out is a consistently interesting and engaging one, offering not only a look at a fantastical world, but adult consideration of eternal, real-world, existential issues. I am sure they would love for you to tag along.Heraclix and Pomp was sent along by the author in return for an honest review"}]}, "authors": ["Forrest Aguirre"], "isbn": "1630230014", "longitude":
