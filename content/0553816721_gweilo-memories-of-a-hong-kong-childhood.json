I love it. Beautifully written memoir. It is hard to believe an eight year-old boy was allowed to wander the streets, squatters camps, dangerous walled city where opium was the norm ( he had been forbidden to go there) etc. He learned the language, immersed himself fully into the Chinese culture learning to speak Cantonese fluently. His parents marital problems are a part of the memoir as they were a part of his awareness. I think, as one reviewer put it, \"bashing\" too strong a sentiment to be used when he tells in passing of the abuse the father heaped on him and the mother;it was his reality. I can't recommend this book enough. My copy, bought in the States is called \" Golden Boy.\""}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "An excellent book for those whom experienced their life in Hong Kong during the 50's, 60's and 70's as an expatriate.There was so much which I can relate to in Martin Booths book, bringing  pangs of nostalgia."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great easy read and if you live or lived in HK, great to relate to the places and experiences."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "A fantastic remembrance of an exotic childhood in Hong Kong.

Unrestricted by parental control, he had free access to hidden corners of the colony normally closed to a Gweilo, a \u201cpale fellow\u201d like him. Befriending rickshaw coolies and local stallholders, he learned Cantonese, sampled delicacies such as boiled water beetles and one-hundred-year-old eggs, and participated in colourful festivals. He even entered the forbidden Kowloon Walled City, wandered into the secret lair of the Triads and visited an opium den. Along the way he encountered a colourful array of people, from the plink plonk man with his dancing monkey to Nagasaki Jim, a drunken child molester, and the Queen of Kowloon, the crazed tramp who may have been a member of the Romanov family.\r\n\r\nShadowed by the unhappiness of his warring parents, a broad-minded mother who, like her son, was keen to embrace all things Chinese, and a bigoted father who was enraged by his family\u2019s interest in \u201cgoing native,\u201d Martin Booth\u2019s compelling memoir is a journey into Chinese culture and an extinct colonial way of life that glows with infectious curiosity and humour.\r\n\r\n\u201c[Gweilo] stands as one of the most original and engaging memoirs of recent years, all the more telling because it is so personal, witty and true. Booth has delivered a pre-coming-of-age book that ranks with the best of the breed.\u201d The Times", "asin": "0553816721", "rank": "237094", "city": "Hong Kong", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510MuCNYF-L.jpg", "country": "China", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
