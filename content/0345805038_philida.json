It has violence, but it also has beauty and simple goodness, courage and understanding.  Descriptive narratives immersed me in this simple, poetic story of an era and area I knew very little about. I enjoyed it!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I am not surprised by the variety of reviews for this book. Philida is a worthwhile read, but not a pleasant one. It was sometimes hard to follow--told in first person from different perspectives and then in third person and with frequent use of Afrikaans words that are unfamiliar to American readers. The brutality of slavery and Philida\u2019s lack of control of her difficult situation are powerfully portrayed, which is hard to read but important. In a way, the book is uplifting--Philida is an interesting character, who grows into a determined, confident woman in spite of her treatment. Other characters are well developed also. I felt the book ended abruptly and that the parts after she left the farm were less complex than the earlier sections, but overall I liked the book."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This is a really hard book to get interested in and then stay interested.  It took twice as long as normal for me to read it.  The beginning chapters were definitely very adult in context and shouldn't be read by kids.  It also ended very abruptly and I didn't see a follow-up book.  I don't think I would read one if available anyway.  On to my next book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "How did I miss this for so long? I was caught in it's web from the first page until the last. Now I wish for more of Philida's story. What an amazing character. Very well written novel about one of the earliest troubled times in the \"beyond description\" history of South Africa.  In 1837 the slaves were freed but had to stay indentured for 4 more years. They were allowed to wear shoes for the first time! The years before, told by Philida and those in her life is a story worth reading to help us learn or remind us to accept people of any color or culture as equal.

You just got to listen and do as they tell you. You don\u2019t say no. You don\u2019t ask questions. You just do what they tell you. But far at the back of your head you think: Soon there must come a day when I can say for myself: This and that I shall do, this and that I shall not.\"\r\n\r\nIn Philida, longlisted for the Man Booker Prize, Andr\u00e9 Brink\u2014\u201cone of South Africa's greatest novelists\u201d (The Telegraph)\u2014gives us his most powerful novel yet; the truly unforgettable story of a female slave, and her fierce determination to survive and to be free.\r\n\r\nIt is 1832 in South Africa, the year before slavery is abolished and the slaves are emancipated. Philida is the mother of four children by Francois Brink, the son of her master. When Francois\u2019s father orders him to marry a woman from a prominent Cape Town family, Francois reneges on his promise to give Philida her freedom, threatening instead to sell her to new owners in the harsh country up north.\r\n\r\nHere is the remarkable story\u2014based on individuals connected to the author\u2019s family\u2014of a fiercely independent woman who will settle for nothing and for no one. Unwilling to accept the future that lies ahead of her, Philida continues to test the limits and lodges a complaint against the Brink family. Then she sets off on a journey\u2014from the southernmost reaches of the Cape, across a great wilderness, to the far north of the country\u2014in order to reclaim her soul.\r\n\r\n\"A soaring, kaleidoscopic account of a slave woman's struggle to protect her humanity. The voice of Philida is wonderfully nuanced and complex\u2014capable of rendering up both the brutality of her experience, and the poetry she manages to wrest from it. A masterful and deeply humane work of art.\"\u00a0Jennifer Egan, author of\u00a0<i>A Visit from the Goon Squad</i>", "asin": "B00FI6QDZW", "rank": 0, "city": "Cape Town", "image": "", "country": "RSA", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
