Yeats' poem \"Easter 1916\"). While politics certainly has a prominent place in the narrative, Iris Murdoch's primary focus is on the interpersonal relationships of a set of characters, most of whom are related to each other at least distantly (Murdoch provides a rundown of the genealogy early in the book: pay attention).Different chapters are told from the perspectives of different characters, who include Andrew Chase-White, a 21-year-old British cavalry officer who has yet to see action in the trenches in France, his (assumed) fiancee Frances, her widowed father Christopher Bellman, Andrew's alcoholic uncle Barney, his Irish nationalist cousins Pat and Cathal Dumay and, most interesting of all, his aunt, the nymphomanic and iconoclastic Millie Kinnard.Murdoch takes quite a bit of time developing the characters before kicking things into motion in the last third of the book, where it all pays off (though one critical scene comes off almost as slapstick comedy). This parallels the political scene as tensions increase as the time of the Uprising grows closer (it actually commenced on Easter Monday, not Sunday). Hidden character motivations and attractions are revealed and (in most cases) acted upon. A brief coda set 22 years later (on the eve of yet another World War) gives a rundown of what happened and also makes one final startling revelation.The Red and the Green is similar to Murdoch's earlier An Unofficial Rose in having a set of characters who seemingly can only love only someone who doesn't love them back. In my review of that book, I termed it a circular firing squad of love, and a similar situation exists here, though not in quite as extreme a form. At the center of the interrelationships are Pat and Millie, who seem to draw the most attention\u2014good and bad\u2014 from other characters. Pat is a quiet man's man respected by even those who disagree with him, while Millie is basically a ditz with little impulse control and ants in her pants. If there's one character you wish had gotten more space in this book, it would be Millie, the fish out of water whose lifestyle would have fit much better with the Swinging Sixties (when Murdoch's book came out)."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This being by Iris Murdoch, it is well-written, but it feels incomplete and sometimes preposterous.  Characters and plot are a mess."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "If written by almost any other author, \"The Red and The Green\" would get 5 stars from me.  It's only on the scale of Murdoch's books that it gets 4.  The title plays on Stendhal's \"The Red and the Black,\" referring to the army and the church/university.  Among other things, those are the two ways a young man could work his way up out of the peasantry.  The choice presented by Murdoch's title would seem to highlight an Irishman's 1916 choice to fight with England against Germany, or to fight with Ireland against England.No other author can display the complexity of an individual's motivation with Murdoch's succinct incisiveness. In two or three paragraphs she can show you some of your own internal drives, some of which you may not have known were there.  Fear and greed, of course, but many subtle bargainings for advantage, and many buried desires, as well.  Dublin in the spring of 1916 may be unrivaled as the place compacted with the most complex and conflicted population of differing human motivations.  Murdoch's talent for displaying human behavior and its drives is put to wonderful use.Initially upon reading the book I felt that she had diminished the Uprising by treating it as a comic opera of confusion among the sexes, but later I came to appreciate that Murdoch plays a deep game.  Although Irish women at the time were not 'allowed' to be political, they did of course have their opinions.  For the most part those opinions are expressed as \"war is stupid,\" e.g., \"there is no such thing as dying for Ireland.\"  It now appears to me that Murdoch has managed to establish some parallels between (a) the seeming randomness of an individual's love for, and attachment to, an inappropriate or even destructive other person, and (b) the compulsion among some Irish to die as an expression of their demand for freedom from a foreign ruler.  No matter any intellectual overlay, the thing called \"the human heart\" can move you to do things that are not to your benefit, and may even result in your destruction.  It's possible that Murdoch's message (if there is one) is that it's this irrational behavior that keeps tyrants from ruling us all."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "An extended Anglo-Irish family living in the vicinity of Dublin on the eve of the Easter Rebellion of 1916 reflects the attitudes and pressures that lead eventually to the cataclysmic events at the Dublin Post Office.  Andrew Chase-White, a young officer in the British Cavalry, has been assigned to Dublin, where he has often spent holidays with his extended family and where he has an almost-fiancee.  His idolized cousin Patrick Dumay, \"the iron man,\" is secretly a member of the Irish Volunteers and an admirer of Padraig Pearse.  His teenaged cousin, hot-headed Cathal, supports the Citizen's Army under James Connolly.As the action unfolds throughout the week leading to the uprising, the family interacts on several levels, revealing their mores, their dreams for the future of Ireland, their occasional tendency to look for religious significance in political destiny, and their personal hopes and failings.  The story of Andrew's chaste courtship of Frances Bellman is thrown into sharp relief through the character of Millicent Kinnard, Andrew's aunt, a flamboyant and overtly sexual woman.Millie has tempted one relative into abandoning his priestly calling, persuaded another to propose marriage to her as a way of solving her financial problems, and worked her wiles on her chaste young nephews, a generation or more younger than she is.  Since she has a peripheral role in the rebellion, Millie, in the absence of a single main character, connects the older and younger generations both socially and politically, acting as a linchpin of the action.Murdoch's stunning ability to choose precisely the right word or phrase leads to memorable descriptions which enliven the story and bring the large cast of characters to life.  Andrew, for example, possesses \"plodding conscientiousness,\" in place of courage.  An elderly man's legs are like \"solidified paste, rigidly tubular yet without significant shape or color.\"  Physical love is regarded by one person as \"the triumph of his will over his fastidious mind.\"Murdoch's eccentric characters combine with her sense of irony to create absurdities that are filled with dark humor, and in one memorable scene, the procession in and out of Millie's boudoir (which also serves as a shooting gallery) resembles a slapstick film.  Less philosophical, perhaps, than some of Murdoch's later novels, this is the only one which uses Murdoch's native Ireland as the setting.

The time, 1916, is the eve of the famous tragic Easter Rebellion in Dublin, which startled Europe even in the midst of the First World War. \r\n\r\nA single Anglo-Irish family provides the extremely diverse characters. Pat Dumay is a Catholic and an Irish patriot. His relentlessly pious mother pursues her own private war with his step-father, a man sunk in religious speculation and drink. Pat's English-bred Protestant cousin and rival, Andrew Chase-White, an officer in King Edward's Horse, puzzles out his complex emotions about Ireland and Frances, the girl he loves, against a background of the fear of death, while Frances's father, Christopher Bellman, scholar and cynic, finds love of Ireland a more passionate matter than he had bargained for. Weaving these people together into a tragi-comic pattern moves Millie Kinnard: fast, feminist, and only just respectable. \r\n\r\nAs rebellion looms nearer, tension mounts in the sombre rain-soaked Dublin streets; and if, in the end, death disperses most of the people, this is felt to be as inevitable as in a Sophoclean play.", "asin": "0099429136", "rank": "3276172", "city": "Dublin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QnQyuDiQL.jpg", "country": "Ireland", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
