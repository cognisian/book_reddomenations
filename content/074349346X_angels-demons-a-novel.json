The story was fast paced, with lots of unexpected twists and turns and a lot of excitement. The numerous historical references and the details about the locations and organizations (CERN in Switzerland, the Vatican in Rome) all made the story come to life. Some of the science seems a bit far-fetched, but still the book was a great read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This was my second reading but having just returned from Rome it was amazing to relive all the locales we had just visited.
