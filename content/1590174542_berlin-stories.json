Aren\u2019t I clever?\u201dBerlin Stories is predominantly short observations of Walser\u2019s surroundings. It\u2019s reflective and doesn\u2019t so much tell a story as park itself on a bench and gaze off eager and misty-eyed into the world, hoping to capture a place and people\u2019s essence in a brisk vignette. Calling this a collection of \u201cstories\u201d seems like a glaring misnomer.Many of these 1-2 page \u201cstories\u201d are bland and trivial, in spite of the author\u2019s exuberance. Yet again, the comparison stands: Journal writing begins with the fantasy that every string of thought that passes through the writer\u2019s mind in the course of a day is not only interesting but deserving of inscription (I\u2019ll attest: It takes the sobering experience of reading one\u2019s own journal perhaps 3 or 4 years gone to realize this is emphatically not the case...).I had never heard of Walser before reading this, but I suspect I am not reading his best here. A better, more sensitive and eloquent writer showed up to pen the last 4 stories, and I was equal parts annoyed and impressed. \u201cFrau Wilke\u201d is moving; \u201cFrau Scheer\u201d is a perceptive and intimate portrait of a lonely woman; and the last, \u201cA Homecoming in the Snow\u201d seemed like the only truly personal and sincere account of the writer himself. If those stories are an indication of Walser\u2019s other work, I\u2019d be happy to read more. I mean, this is beautiful:\u201cThere I saw on the bed the things which the poor lady had till recently worn, her dress, her hat, her sunshade, and her umbrella, and, on the floor, her small delicate boots. The strange sight of them made me unspeakably sad, and my peculiar state of mind made it seem to me almost that I had died myself, and life in all its fullness, which had often appeared so huge and beautiful, was thin and poor to the point of breaking. All things past, all things vanishing away, were more close to me than ever. For a long time I looked at Frau Wilke\u2019s possessions, which now had lost their mistress and lost all purpose, and at the golden room, glorified by the smile of the evening sun, while I stood there motionless, not understanding anything anymore.\u201d"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Most of these \"stories\" are actually very short newspaper columns written by Walser. Unfortunately, the book doesn't make clear where or in what form each piece was originally published. Many of the pieces here do not translate well to a modern reader; Kafka may have laughed his head off reading \"Mountain Halls\" but without any context it's impossible for me to see why.There are gems hidden within this collection: \"Fire,\" \"Frau Wilke,\" and \"Frau Scheer\" are all well worth your time. Sadly, there are many more stories that should have remained in the scholarly archive, and offer nothing to a casual reader, including most of the \"Theater\" section. Bizarrely, right after \"Frau Scheer\" we are given \"The Millionairess\" which is simply a short outline (rough draft?) of the preceding story.It is fascinating to watch the almost comically hyperbolic optimism of the early newspaper pieces collapse into the black hole of the two late stories, \"Frau Wilke\" and \"Frau Scheer,\" which are both excellent and unrelentingly bleak. However, despite some worthwhile stories, this is definitely not the best introduction to Walser."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I expected to be hypnotized by this book, as I was by Jakob von Gunten, but alas it did not happen.

Berlin Stories has numerous terrific moments, the unique context of his time spent in Berlin is fascinating and like all of his writing, it resonates fully across the generations.
