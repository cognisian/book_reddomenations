If there are political views expressed in this review, they are informed by The Prague Cemetery, Umberto Eco's novel treatment of the development of perhaps the most evil piece of fiction ever concocted.The Prague Cemetery by Umberto Eco is the perfect type of book to read with ready access to the internet. In fact, I can't imagine reading this book without the instantaneous aid of online research facilities. Using online resources, the reader can begin delving into deeper source material to discover that this twisted tale of political intrigue and espionage is based on historical facts. Perhaps knowing that fact up front, will keep some readers going through the long slog of the three part narrative.The original editions of the antisemitic work referenced throughout The Prague Cemetery, were indeed written by the characters mentioned here. I don't know enough of the history to say where truth ends and fiction begins, but that blurring of the historical in the novel is part of what makes Umberto Eco's writing such an excellent introduction into his semiotics and philosophy.Presciently, Eco stated before his death that social media was being misused and he saw it as a growing concern. The fact that demagogues now have an open platform to share their views, somehow makes the fact that Henry Ford paid to have half-a-million copies of the worst type of hate literature printed, pale in significance. The book Ford had printed, and its history as a 19th century sensationalist phenomenon, led directly to the \"final solution\". That is the book at the very core of this novel. A forgery protected by \"free speech\" and often quoted by Hitler in \"Mein Kampf\".Where are we headed today?\u201cSocial media gives legions of idiots the right to speak when they once only spoke at a bar after a glass of wine, without harming the community. Then they were quickly silenced, but now they have the same right to speak as a Nobel Prize winner. It\u2019s the invasion of the idiots.\u201d - Umberto EcoDisinformation once promoted in print by an antisemitic American industrialist, can now be spread much more widely and effectively. At the dawning of the age of the internet troll Eco produced this novel on the anti-intellectual roots of 20th century antisemitism. Can it do anything to stop the tsunami of fear and hate mongering online today? We now live in the era of the unabashed, unrepentant troll, who feels no compunction to seek the truth, nor desire to let thinking interfere with his world view. And if we, the readers of Umberto Eco, complain that the views expressed by the trolls are nothing more than the warmed over remnants of 19th century charlatans, we are accused of attacking \"free speech\" along with the 21st century freedom to hate on a grand scale.How will we teach the coming generations any truth, when it appears that their ideas and views of the world are being misshapen daily by those willing to mix a specific dose of hatred with a calculated misspoken half truth, or as it is more simply referred to: lies. We can no longer call out our politicians as liars. For some reason, now, when people misquote facts, embellish lies with greater lies and sell it all -- to a public gleefully willing to buy it at exorbitant rates -- those who oppose the shilling hucksterism of populist demagogues are accused as socialists, communists, or worst of all: intellectuals. This is eerily similar to the world described in The Prague Cemetery.Intellectuals faced with a crisis of believability where science, facts and historical data are concerned, are forced to confront a world safe in its own truthiness. All of these themes are presented in this novel that could be describing our own future, by uncovering our very real past. Accepting the views of the hucksters and throwing the expeditious criminals into jail has real consequences for a society. If we choose to disentangle ourselves from the hard truths that bind us together, we may find that we have set sail adrift on a current of half truths that can only lead to tragedy.The fact that the ultimate goal of the actual work being written here in Eco's novel, is considered by almost every author as secondary to the will for political power, money and greed certainly doesn't portend well for a society built on internet hate-bait, anger-click, yellow churnalism that seeks to maximize revenue, casually disregarding the facts. The problem is: Truthiness has never set anyone free."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The Prague Cemetery made me google all the characters, the conflicts of the time and even the streets where they lived and fought. I appreciate an historical fiction that compels me to verify it's validity. Along the way, I learn about this period of time.Eco entwines a mystery into this 19th century Euro history with a fictional character(s) who disintegrates through the story.The book could have been shorter but for some absurdly long rantings where I had to jump over pages of it. Overall, it was worth the read because I got a clearer understanding of the time and how it relates to what I see happening today."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I know it the scholarly thing to give it a rave review, but I found myself laboring to finish it at times.

Eco is definitely a master of holding one's suspense in a novel. But I found Eco generally unsuccessful at getting inside the mind of a conspiracy theorist. Eco's politics are fairly bland and he doesn't seem privy to the type of worldview that would allow you to really step inside the protagonist's shoes. All in all, the book is worth a look for the first 30 pages or so, but I found it unconvincing and lost interest partway through."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Thank you"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Given the reknown and accolades, I owed it to myself to give Umberto Eco a read.  Perhaps this was not a good first choice (I will try another), but I found _The Prague Cemetery_ to be confusing, tedious and a struggle to stay interested.  I rarely quit reading a book mid-way through, but I did so in this case.The book is a series of diary entries, the identity of the protagonist is difficult to determine: he either suffers from multiple personality disorder or is merely having a laugh at our expense - it was never clear to me (even after reading the first 120 pages).  To complicate matters further, Eco jumps around in time, adding a whole other level of confusion and mystery to who our narrator is and what he's on about.In spite of my struggles and ultimate failure to finish the book, it is clearly apparent that Eco is a gifted writer.  The voice(s) of Simonini are witty - funny, even, as he is abrasive, cantankerous, deeply mysogynisitc and prejudiced against all manner of people from the French to the Freemasons to Jesuitis - yet in spite of these repugnant character traits, he is not without some redeeming features.  This is no easy feat for a writer to pull off, and Eco does so masterfully.I am disappointed in my choice, but will absolutely give Eco another chance.  It seems, sadly, that _The Prague Cemetery_ was just not a good choice for an introduction to Eco's writing."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I know it the scholarly thing to give it a rave review, but I found myself laboring to finish it at times.
