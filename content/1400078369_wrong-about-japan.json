First, this reader absolutely loves Peter Carey books. His prose is just unique and he rarely wastes sentences, let alone paragraphs when he gets into full swing with his books. Secondly, this reader was also drawn to reading it because he has lived in Japan for a very long time and still continues to live there even today. So, he was very keen to read the book, but strangely enough, this reader thought it was only average. It took this reader more than half of the short book for Carey's writing to drag him along and apart from the finish to the book there was only one other part that really caught the readers attention. He thought it was a meander down memory lane rather than the powerful prose of Peter Carey. It was an unmoving and disappointing account by Carey.This reader was so disappointed with Carey's, \"Wrong about Japan\" that he thought about so many other really good books that he has read about Japan. The absolute best book about Japan that you could read (in this persons' opinion) would be: Alex Kerr's, \"Dogs and Demons\". A fabulous read that underpins the structural, social and some economic problems that exist in Japan. Some other Kerr's of books are worth a read too such as, \"Lost Japan\" and \"Living in Japan\". For a light hearted entertaining read you could try Simon May's, \"Atomic Sushi\" or \"The Accidental Office Lady\" by Laura Kriska; For an almost polar opposite account of Japan read you could try, \"Peasants, Rebels and Outcasts\" by Mikaso Hane or the fabulous Kaplin and Dubro's, \"Yakuza\" about the nasty seedy underside of Japan. Of course, there are books on its' politics, history, Bushido, WW2 (of course), cook books, travel books and language books just to name a few topics available about Japan.This reader just thought Carey's, \"Wrong about Japan\" was strangely average. A person who has won numerous literature awards seemed to have mocked up or slapped sticked a quick yarn about his son to no great effect. It scrapes in for a mere two stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I love Shogun and books about ancient Japan. I have never read manga, but was intrigued by the idea of a father and son visit because I want to go myself. The author gives such good details and uses self-deprecating humor to allow us to know what it feels like to be a foreigner in a land where social rules are so different, even in modern times, to westerners. I related to raising a child in the digital age when I almost hate my smart phone.I didn't like some of the repetitive information and the author at times was a little harsh about the supposed superiority of the Japanese. However, the interview with a man who talked about living through the bombing during WWII was of great value and I will never forget it.This is a fun, quick read with precious nuggets throughout."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Absolute garbage.

I've never read anything by him before, but was intrigued when I saw the title at a local library.  I've had a lifelong fascination with Japan since I lived there for a year in 1960 when my dad had a Fullbright Scholarship that financed the trip for our family.This book is an entertaining nonfiction account of a middle school-aged New York City boy named Charlie who has a fascination with Japanese manga (visually told stories, like comics with a distinctly Japanese flavor), and anime, or Japanese animation films. His dad Peter, who narrates the story, wants to visit Japan with his son. Charlie agrees only on the condition that they don't just visit temples, Noh dramas, Kabuki theater, and the usual traditional spots. The boy wants to visit manga authors and publishers, and anime studios and directors.Although, much to the chagrin of Charlie, his dad does take him to some of the more traditional tourist sites, including a four-hour Noh drama Charlie suffers through and later claims to have been the worst experience of his life, they also visit the manga and anime worlds. Peter, through his contacts with the Japanese publisher of his books, is able to line up dates with some very famous and talented manga and anime artists.The absolute topper of their trip is that they actually arrange a visit with Hayao Miyazaki, the revered animation genius who created and directed such films as \"Spirited Away\", \"My Neighbor Totoro\", and \"Castle in the Sky\". If you have not seen any of these films, do! Comically, when they actually meet Miyazaki, whom they catch somewhat unexpectedly while touring the studio on a day it is shut down, they have no interpreter and wind up communicating largely through gestures and some flip books Miyazaki shares with them.The book is quite charming, and it's fun to see a father and son having such a great time together as they bicker in between adventures with exotic food and Japanese culture both traditional and contemporary. There's a kind of running gag throughout the book that every time Peter asks the manga and anime artists a question, they shake their heads and state vaguely that the question is so off-the-mark, if not downright moronic, that they really can't be bothered to answer it. Handled politely, of course. This is Japan after all.At 158 pages, it's a fun and quick read, and you'll learn a bit about Japan in the 21st century in the process."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a very enjoyable book.
