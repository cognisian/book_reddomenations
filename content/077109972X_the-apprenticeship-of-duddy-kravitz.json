The story is clever: Duddy, marginalized and impoverished, working-class and academically challenged, with no mother and a \"dope\" for a father, graduates from high school without any prospects except slaving in his uncle Benjy's garment factory. However, while working as a waiter at a countryside resort he happens upon a lake and decides to buy it to have it developed. This is Duddy's ticket out of poverty and obscurity. With everyone against him, you can't help but root for him. But when it becomes clear that Duddy will do anything to achieve his dream, the question becomes: do you still support him and why? This is essentially a morality play back-dropped by absurdity and treachery. In between the laughs, it raises questions about social class, racism, and capitalism. It remains a Canadian classic.Troy Parfitt is the author of War Torn: Adventures in the Brave New Canada."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "The book was hard to follow and Duddy was a skag.

Growing up in the heart of Montreal\u2019s Jewish ghetto, Duddy Kravitz is obsessed with his grandfather\u2019s saying, \u201cA man without land is nothing.\u201d \r\n\r\nIn his relentless pursuit of property and his drive to become a somebody, he will wheel and deal, he will swindle and forge, he will even try making movies. And in spite of the setbacks he suffers, the sacrifices he must make along the way, Duddy never loses faith that his dream is worth the price he must pay. \r\n\r\nThis blistering satire traces the eventful coming-of-age of a cynical dreamer. Amoral, inventive, ruthless, and scheming, Duddy Kravitz is one of the most magnetic anti-heroes in literature, a man who learns the hard way that dreams are never exactly what they seem, even when they do come true.\r\n", "asin": "077109972X", "rank": "2438184", "city": "Montreal", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ARrVELFUL.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
