Doctorow's brilliant novel Billy Bathgate, and it's even better than I remembered. Told from the viewpoint of a poverty-stricken teenager in 1935 who catches the eye of the notorious Dutch Schultz mob and is with them until their demise, it's a tremendous experience.Part coming-of-age, part dance-with-the-devil, part homage to a departed era, and part action novel, this one's a feast for people who like the written word. Doctorow accomplishes a lot in this book, but one thing he does especially well is make deft references to events and thoughts and observations that happened earlier in the story. At the end of the novel you realize just how important it was to pay attention to the little things all the way through.He also brings real people back to life as unforgettable characters. From Schultz's brilliant right-hand man Otto \"Abbadabba\" Berman to his most talented hitman Bo Weinberg, from the deadly and unnamed nemesis who is unquestionably Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano to the volatile, crafty, and self-destructive Dutchman himself, they walk, talk, and rampage again in this story. I strongly recommend it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A 1930's American gangster classic. So chock full of love, life, death and the will to survive set down in clean, Hemingwayesque  prose. The rich cast of characters got under my skin so deeply they haunted my dreams.Can't believe I discovered Doctorow so late in life, but now am on a mission to devour his other works."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Enjoyable blend of history and fiction.

The fruits of the meticulous memory of Billy Bathgate become a great story for the reader, and a magical windfall for the title character at the conclusion of the novel.The racket deals in beer, unions, policy, and \u2018runs it like a candy store.\u2019  But it also deals in death, beginning with the murder of Bo Weinberg at the start of the novel, with his feet stuck into a bucket of cement until it sufficiently hardened, then the body dumped in the East River.There is also the murder of Julie Martin, up in Onondaga County, where Dutch Schultz and his associates spend a summer preparing for the income tax evasion trial of the boss.  They spend money around town like it\u2019s candy, make donations to local causes, and essentially buy the goodwill of the community.  Schultz even has a highly publicized conversion to the Roman Catholic religion, sponsored by \u2018a man with the bad skin.  The one he respects so.\u2019  A portion of that community becomes the jury for the trial in Onondaga County, the one which concludes with the judge saying \u201cin all my years on the bench I have never witnessed such disdain of truth and evidence as you have manifested today.\u201d\u201cI promise, I tell him in the first act of mercy in my life\u201d to take care of his girl, says Billy, as Bo Weinberg is facing his sentence.  This promise nearly becomes his undoing.  Bo\u2019s girl becomes Dutch\u2019s girl--what choice does she have after being a witness to Bo\u2019s execution?  In Onondaga, Bo\u2019s girl Drew is introduced as Billy\u2019s governess, and the two spend plenty of time together keeping up appearances.  By the time she becomes expendable, Billy has fallen for Miss Drew, and when the two are dispatched to Saratoga, it may be a trip to their own funeral.Yet Billy is also resourceful, and lucky, he\u2019s the kind of guy who makes his own luck, so the reader has the feeling that Billy can change the script. He was trying to catch on, but had to navigate the tricky boundaries of making himself available without being pushy. He seemed in a pickle when he went to the numbers house with his paper bag of cupcakes, but the incident became his opportunity.  \u201cYou handle Saratoga, kid, I\u2019ll believe you can handle anything,\u201d said numbers man Addadabba Berman.  But Billy was so nuts about Miss Drew that he couldn\u2019t see straight, and that kinda nuts can get your own nuts in a bind.As spellbinding as Ragtime was, or The March, or World\u2019s Fair, or Waterworks were, Billy Bathgate might be E.L. Doctorow\u2019s best novel."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "An interesting tale, curious enough to keep me engaged.
