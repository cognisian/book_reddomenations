Constantly guessing who the real bad guys were, great story twist. Left me wanting more."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "For an author that claims to do research, his sloppy research on this book just turned me off.  The main protagonist is flown 3,000 miles in an F-14 Tomcat without refueling - all at Mach 2.2!  Apparently the fact than an F-14 needs to be on after burners to go Mach 2.2 - and would have enough fuel to last about 10 minutes at that speed - or to go about 250 miles - escapes him.  What trash.  What's even funnier, after dropping off it's passenger, the Tomcat apparently takes off and returns without refueling - a round trip of 6,000 miles.  I wonder if it traveled home at Mach 2.2. also!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "best dan brown everspellbinding adventure  The twists and turns left me spell bound till the end of the book"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "With every passing chapter I formulated my own plot, and each time I was wrong.

A good elaborated idea with true scientific facts that engages you with the story, but he turned it into a soap opera with mission impossible paraphernalia.He is writing novels like film scripts, making sure there is enough 3D effects justification, to hide the story lack of a truthful ending."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book kept me interested from beginning to end.  The mixture of topics...White House,  NASA, geology...kept producing one event after another.

The movie is good but the book is so much better. Just be careful, you might just learn something. Dan brown really does the research. I recommend this book very highly."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "This is not the real Dan Brown as I have read all his other books and really love the way he uses science and symbolism to intertwine his story but this one was boring. I read half the book and put it down as there was no interest in it fir me. I just hope his new one is as good as all his others but this one does not stand up to the real Dan Brown."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great Story!  recommended read for sure.
