It gave her the creeps every time she rode in it.Leah is given the flight to San Francisco where the funeral is to be but Hans is not included. In a fit of rage about it, he grabs Leah by the neck. She\u2019s seen his anger before but not to this extreme. His reaction fuels her exit remorseful that he is.Judy was years prior both a mentor and a friend to Leah.

Her beloved former boss and friend, Judy, has died in a car accident and left Leah her most prized possession and, as it turns out, the instrument of Judy\u2019s death: a red sports car.\r\n\r\nJudy was the mentor Leah never expected. She encouraged Leah\u2019s dreams, analyzed her love life, and eased her into adulthood over long lunches away from the office. Facing the jarring disconnect between the life she expected and the one she is now actually living, Leah takes off for San Francisco to claim Judy\u2019s car. In sprawling days defined by sex, sorrow, and unexpected delight, Leah revisits past lives and loves in search of a self she abandoned long ago. Piercing through Leah\u2019s surreal haze is the enigmatic voice of Judy, as sharp as ever, providing wry commentary on Leah\u2019s every move.\r\n\r\nFollowing her \"irresistible\" (Time) and \"wicked\" (Slate) novel Bad Marie, Dermansky evokes yet another edgy, capricious, and beautifully haunting heroine\u2015one whose search for realization is as wonderfully unpredictable and hypnotic as the twists and turns of the Pacific Coast Highway. \r\n\r\nTautly wound, transgressive, and mordantly funny, The Red Car is an incisive exploration of one woman\u2019s unusual route to self-discovery.", "asin": "1631492330", "rank": "654947", "city": "San Francisco", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41y06bsQs8L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
