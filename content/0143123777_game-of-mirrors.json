I've enjoyed Catarella, Fazio, Mimi and of course Salvo.This particular book has not been made into a TV movie, I think.  At least I don't remember it (it is always possible I've seen it and simply forgotten!) and so in one regard this was particularly fun for me to read: I did not know how it would end.The title of the book is very appropriate as it does seem that it is a deadly game that is being played.  One that for a good part of the book does not make a lot of sense.  Things are not what they seem, to be sure.We see Salvo at the top of his game, here, against a quite challenging set of circumstances.  There is, of course the obligatory whining about growing old, and the fact that he is being seduced by a young, beautiful, woman.  One might get tired of those predictable things, but perhaps it is the current summer heat wave -- I have forgiven him for his failings.This was just simply a lovely summer read.  As I write this, I'm not quite certain if it is the last of the books.  There might be one or two more.  At the same time I was reading this, MHz released for streaming the most recent two movies.  So a wonderful double-dose of Montalbano.  The actors in the shows all are growing older as well (except the actor who plays Fazio!  He is forever young!).  It is a pleasant way to spend a hot July.I didn't realize it for the longest time that Camilleri's books about Montalbano always have 18 chapters.  It's an impressive feat.  The one negative comment I have about Game of Mirrors is that it ends very abruptly.  Bam! It's done.  You're left wanting maybe just a little bit more... and maybe that's not such a bad thing."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Like almost all Camilleri, a great story.

All Camilleri\u2019s books are written in Italian; the outstanding Stephen Sartarelli is Camilleri\u2019s translator.  In many places in the book I howled with laughter. (Many strange looks on the bus.)Camilleri\u2019s Montalbano,  Commissioner Inspector and Fazio is his right hand and prot\u00e9g\u00e9, are very smart and work together to determine who is behind the killings. Love blooms, unique this series.  Several great characters, fully developed, are part of the action. The secretive involvement of the Mafia clouds the solution. However, Montalbano is a reader of good literature, and he eventually sees through the intricate plan. Montalbano\u2019s series of questions and the resultant interrogations of those involved in the crimes lead to solving the many ugly murders.A great read!  I look forward to the Camilleri\u2019s next book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Enjoyable Inspector Montalbano mystery.
