It's hilarious and heartbreaking, and yes, as others have pointed out, full of foul language and furious emotion. That's a good thing! This novel is about what it's like to feel pulled by two different cultures, and how we find home--with our families? Inside ourselves? It's also a coming of age story with a frank and very real point of view about how the protagonist begins to have a sexual awakening. It's great. Read it, unless you are squirmish about foul language and real prtrayals of women's sexuality, in which case stick to Anne of Green Gables or whatever."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Interesting novel about the coming of age of a Palestinian American young lady, set in the Middle East of the 90s and then in Texas.

Like many first novels, this is very autobiographical with the central character, Nidali, being. like Jarrar, a Palestinian-American born in the U.S. but having a childhood in Kuwait and Egypt before moving back to the U.S. as a teenager.Because Jarrar had an interesting life, there are sections of the book that reflect that.  Her family's flight across Iraq after that country occupied Kuwait was a thrilling ride and their inability to go home afterwards because of the pro-Iraq stance of Palestinian leaders was touchingly done.However, one gets the impression that Jarrar simply took the happenstance events of her own life and fictionalized them without the additional focus that a novel requires.The relationship with, Esam, the fundamentalist cousin is a missed opportunity and an example.  This could've have been a very intriguing conflict between a westernized adolescent and an indoctrinated jihadi wannabe but it becomes a relatively unconnected incident with a character who remains undeveloped.  The story of Nidali's name, a boy's name from a father whose hopes for a son led him to prematurely name her with a boy's name, Nidal, which was them feminized with an \"i\" after he realized that he'd jumped the gun, is an example of cutesy touch that doesn't really go anywhere.  The sections on her discovering sexuality and her teenage romance with Fakhr seem like typical YA fare.Indeed, much of the novel is like that the above;  Jarrar certainly has personality but I think this would have been more engaging as a memoir rather than a novel."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "This woman is sick and bitter and ethnocentric as a nazi."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I like it.
