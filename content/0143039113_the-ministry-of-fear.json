It's also beautifully written, with a hero - if that's the right word - so damaged, so vulnerable that the reader can't help but sympathize with him and his predicament as he bravely tries, in war-torn London, to find the reasons he is being hunted by both the police (for a murder he didn't commit) and by Nazi agents for the secrets he may have unwittingly exposed merely by winning a fateful cake at a village fete. The author had first hand experience of the blitz in London, which is on display in the grim, fitfully violent world of this tale. That it's also quite funny, in a darkly unsettling way, is only one of the reasons this  novel transcends the strictures of the the spy genre. In fact, Greene was inventing the genre as he went along. Only Conrad and Somerset Maugham had explored this territory in a literary way before him. Ian Fleming's James Bond and the espionage fiction of John Le Carre were still in the future when \"Ministry of Fear\" (great title!) was published in 1943."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This 1943 novel is subtitled \u2018an entertainment\u2019, Greene\u2019s term for lighter works he produced, but is it really \u2018light\u2019? It starts out as a literal interpretation of the English saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t have your cake and eat it\u201d. Arthur Rowe wins a cake at a fundraising event after consulting its fortune teller. Its organisers are reluctant to let him have it, but Arthur takes it home. Next day, a man arrives at his lodging house and insinuates himself into eating slice after crumbling slice of said cake. Then a German bomb strikes the house. [After all, the novel is situated in London during the Blitz.]Arthur used to be a journalist. He has been tried for killing his terminally-ill wife and was sent (briefly) to a psychiatric institution and is now unemployable. Neither the armed forces nor civil defence want him in its ranks. He had few possessions, just his clothes and two books he loved when young and reread again and again, but he is financially secure. He is convinced his visitor on the fateful night tried to poison him and is keen on finding out why. Did the cake he was not meant to win,  contain something he must not find?Graham Greene did his bit for the country by e.g. concocting this espionage novel, co-starring an \u2018Austrian refugee\u2019 brother and sister surnamed Hilfe (\u2018help\u2019, \u2018aid\u2019, \u2018assistance\u2019) running a well-connected humanitarian agency with plenty of volunteers. Greene pictures plenty of wartime poverty, stoicism and sacrifice on behalf of the home nation. And portrays (even) blundering Arthur, stunned, burdened and confused by his life\u2019s losses, as useful in the war effort! Was made into a \u2018noir\u2019 war movie in 1944.

I am sure the rest of his books are easier to read."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "If you were to level an accusatory finger at Greene's \"entertainments\", as he called them, you might say they're too much like \"novels\". They're stitched up too conveniently and implausibilities become credible as you're bustled along by the hastily woven plotting \u2013 it's almost as if the novelist saves himself from the incredulity of the reader at the last moment by sleight of hand, and you let him get away with it \u2013 or otherwise \u2013 with a grudging (perhaps nodding) respect. \"The Ministry of Fear\" is one of Greene's best of this category, and it's amnesia (of the hapless protagonist, victim) that rescues what almost becomes an implausible narrative. Read it to the end and it's haunting on multiple levels, hinting at some of the much greater work Greene does in \"The Heart of the Matter\" and \"The Quiet American\". Even when he was writing fast, there's a profundity to Greene: she loved him better when his past became a mystery to himself ... and so he let it be.
