Gorton is aware of the lack of environmental substance which has always featured in Stead\u2019s work. Referring to the author\u2019s note taking, the scraps of comments, conversations, ideas: \u2018The landscapes went, and most of the weather, along with the ordinary narrative machinery of getting a character out of a room and down some stairs; so did the historic backdrop and the characters; backstories\u2019. And so we have a hotel the Hotel Swiss-Touring. A cheap hotel, not a \u2018pension\u2019, overlooking a Swiss Lake leading to the French border where \u2018Most of our guests are in bed by eleven, a middle-aged set.\u2019 The story is told by the twenty-six year old owner Swiss German \u2018Selda\u2019 Bonnard who is married to Roger a poor would-be playboy Swiss French. They have a young son Oliver. Mme Bonnard carries the confidences of her guests and Italian, French and Swiss staff. It\u2019s a hotel which in season caters for skiers and passing tourists and also puts up artistes and road companies of the local casino and nightclubs. But the motor car and better roads will soon see this \u2018reclusive\u2019 home for war-torn and former British empire colonialists, a mad Belgian Mayor, an old Princess, a racist American heiress and others an anachronism. The author takes the attitude and observations of Somerset Maugham, but Mme Bonnard is not always there to observe the detail. Thus we are dropped in and out of meetings and conversations, where the characters\u2019 dialogues (third person) become the main features of the story. The novel runs (awkwardly like Balzac) without chapters and the first break comes at page 31. One wonders how the final pages will end. There is a build-up, but who will be the receiver of good or ill? Mme Bonnard sets the rules and makes her final observations. She\u2019s an hotelier who for her age has matured much and continues on. The guests have their favourite staff and also mix occasionally with each other. The best examples come at outings to the local restaurants, followed by visit to nightclubs. Some guests want to impress, others sneer. They are suspicious of the English whose pound has plummeted and who lack style. Mr Wilkins a former rubber marketeer in Malaya and now sometime currency speculator is suspect. His \u2018cousin\u2019 the rich Eurasian Mrs Trollope gains some sympathy. \u2018Mrs Trollope told me everything and I soon understood; yet you are always astonished at how people can muddle their lives.\u2019 One of these outings involves the Blaises (a strange doctor and wife couple), the Palinosts and the Princess with her singing dog. It goes on for over fifteen per cent of novel. Mr Wilkins is paying (or rather his undeclared de facto). Virginia Woolf could scarcely do better. Stead has the measure of subtlety, observation and dialogue to breathe life into this amazing soir\u00e9e. Serve the appropriate wines, food and have the guests talk about their estranged children and say outrageous things, the party takes on its own direction. All this in a part of Europe not altogether safe from the Russians, as the Cold War reaches a crescendo. This is a brief novel of Stead\u2019s long time observations of people and events from several countries. She\u2019s done an artful job in bringing us something entirely different from her usual lengthy opus.Martin Kerr has written seven novels and two volumes of short stories. His books, including New Guinea Patrol first published as a hardback in 1973, are available on Kindle or through his website."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "It is quirky but not good enough to recommend."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I expected more.  I know, I'm a Hun.  But throughout my reading of the book, I had the impression it was a poor translation from German into English.  Excellent premise, a small hotel, post war Europe, refugees, but for me, there are better portrayals out there."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "3.5 starsThe Little Hotel is the tenth novel published by Australian author, Christina Stead. This edition is published under the Text Classics banner and sports a gorgeous colourful cover by the talented W H Chong, as well as an introduction by poet and author, Lisa Gorton. While it was not published until 1973, Stead began writing it, or some version of it, in the early 1950s, based on her diaries of her time in Europe with her partner, communist sympathiser, William Blake, in the fifties.Mme Selda Bonnard runs Hotel Swiss-Touring with her husband, Roger and their multi-cultural staff. Their guests are equally diverse, and Selda\u2019s observations about them and of their interactions form the bulk of this novel. It\u2019s just a few years after the end of World War Two, and Swiss-Touring is a cheap lake-shore hotel that caters to tourists as well as longer-term residents.Against a backdrop of paranoia about the possible Russian invasion and the difficulties of retrieving funds from their native lands, the hotel\u2019s guests, past and present, are described in potted histories and anecdotes; their petty crises and domestic dramas are filled with snobbery, racism, jealousy and insecurity. Many of the guests are eccentric; one turns out to be crazy; others may even be dangerous.Stead evokes post-war Europe with consummate ease, firmly establishing the era with both her characters\u2019 ideas, opinions and dilemmas, and the political and financial situation. This neat little volume will appeal to readers who enjoy historical fiction with a good dose of satire. Classic fiction from an award-winning Australian author."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A strange one. Set in lausanne in a small pension style hotel, with an eclectic assortment of permanent or coming-going-coming residents from a variety of European backgrounds.Nothing really happens. They whinge about each other, reveal themselves, their prejudices, racisms, absurdities as they eat the horrible meals, interact with the hotel staff, or stroll around the lake.I read one academic feminist analysis which sees Stead as having created synedoches, wherin each character represents a social, economic, financial, political position of post-WW2 Europe, and noone was very nice. There was no Eleanor Roosevelt trying to intelligently steer a United Nations through! I don't know about all this. I don't think I have the patience to unravel its greater meanings, if there are any. Maybe it was a product of its times in that sense.Stead was a Marxist and she had also lived in Europe and elsewhere following men who didn't really appreciate her and took her for granted, like the only really sympathetic character, Mrs Trollope.I did really enjoy the wry and ironic tone, which reminded me in places of Trollope's masterpiece - the Barchester Chronicles - though no-one approached the odiousness of Obadiah Slope! Is that why Mrs Trollope was named thus? There were flashes of Jane Austenesque social satire as well. There is a series of grotesques who are very funny. So, synedoches aside, I enjoyed it."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The book starts off a bit slow but the last half is wickedly funny.  Always perceptive, Christina Stead brings the bizarre life of a little hotel to the reader in a way that is impossible not to recognize if you have ever been there.  The restaurant scene in Chapter 5 is a tour de force only matched by the incredible chapter in The House of All Nations where the two couples have dinner.  I am going to read every one of her books."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Though London\u2019s Times Literary Supplement has placed Christina Stead in the company of Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Ibsen, and Joyce, she still remains unknown to most readers in the United States, despite her deliciously twisted sense of humor, her pointed social satire, and her vividly depicted characters.  In this novel, set in a small hotel on Lake Geneva in the immediate aftermath of World War II, Stead introduces an assortment of bizarre guests currently living at the small Hotel Swiss-Touring. Though most of them are accustomed to more elegant accommodations, the twenty-six-year-old hotelkeeper, Selda Bonnard, and her slightly older husband Roger do their best to meet their guests\u2019 needs.In this first person narrative, told by Selda Bonnard, the various guests at the hotel come alive for the reader.  One, who claims to be the Mayor of B in Belgium, appears to be certifiable, creating numbered documents about his stay in the hotel and traveling to \u201cthe clinic\u201d daily for \u201cinjections\u201d and shock treatments.  Mrs. Blaise, whose husband comes to visit every other weekend from Basel, claims to have millions of dollars and packets of jewels safely stowed in New York banks.  Mrs. Trollope, a dark woman from \u201cthe East,\u201d lives with her \u201ccousin,\u201d Robert Wilkins, who is constantly following the exchange rates and suggesting that his \u201ccousin\u201d move her accounts out of England closer to him.  A strange English woman named Miss Abbey-Chillard, who appears to have almost no money, also appears to have serious health issues and demands special foods.These five permanent guests form the core of the novel, and as they reveal themselves through their conversations and interactions, they begin to resemble characters in a dramatic comedy of manners.  The hotel employees resent them and their frequently high-handed demands, and an undercurrent of cruelty by the employees toward the guests emerges.  The Mayor of B provides unintentional comic relief throughout, and when he begins to imitate the strip tease dancer who lives upstairs, his deep-seated problems become public.  Gradually, through the characters\u2019 conversations, the reader learns the nature of the relationships among all the other characters, with most of the action eventually focused on the relationship of Mrs. Trollope and her \u201ccousin,\u201d Robert Wilkins.All of Stead\u2019s characters are flawed, and since all are shown in intimate scenes in which they reveal themselves, at least to the reader, they inspire a kind of empathy \u2013 and even a pervading sadness \u2013 which does not often happen within social satire, which is usually characterized by sterotypes.  Even Mme. Bonnard, the hotel keeper, has her problems, and though she is the main unifying character, her inflexibility regarding aspects of the hotel management make her less than sympathetic, at some points.  The novel as a whole is elegant and consummately literary, building an intense, darkly humorous, and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere as the characters try to live their straitened lives and survive to live another day in a changed world.  Christina Stead, a superb novelist who can easily hold her own with contemporaries Beryl Bainbridge, Fay Weldon, Penelope Lively, and Muriel Spark in England, and Thea Astley and Elizabeth Jolley in Australia, deserves much more recognition in the US."}]}, "authors": ["Christina Stead"], "isbn": "0805024123", "longitude": 6.1466014, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "The Little Hotel: A Novel",
