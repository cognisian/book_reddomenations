Rutherford had arrived in New Orleans, Louisiana a year earlier from southern Illinois.  He thought the city had beautiful demi-mondaines aplenty in every hue; it was his kind of town, full of excitement. Marriage to a schoolteacher was the farthest thing from his mind.Rutherford\u2019s only chance of escape from Isadora and Zeringue was to become a cook aboard a ship, the Republic, bound for Guinea, to purchase African slaves. He hoped his absence would dissuade Isadora and his creditors forgetting he existed.Aboard the Republic was a vile, heartless, shrewd dwarf, Captain Ebenezer Falcon, whose byword was Never Explain and Never Apologize.  Falcon had no difficulty running the ship and keeping his motley crew of rapist, murderers and scalawags in line. They all had secrets, and Falcon accepted Rutherford as assistant cook to First Cook, Squibb.In the costal trading post at Bangalang, Falcon bought the mysterious Allmuseri tribesmen, thought by slave masters to be the best quality.  He also purchased their god, kept in the hold, a deity considered telepathic. The crew blamed the deity and Allmuseri for the monstrous storms and later disintegration of the ship\u2019s contents. Mutiny, cannibalism, and an unfurling of diseases, resulted in deaths. Even Rutherford had a meltdown after coming face-to-face with the deity.Although irresponsible, Rutherford is smart, articulate and engaging. He found seafaring disturbing and restricting. He missed the mischievousness and pleasure of his vice, stealing, and the very thought of stealing gave him a \u2018tingle,\u2019 \u201c...as if I was slipping inside another\u2019s soul.\u201d He stole doubloons from Falcon and read his journal, discovering a man who sacrificed spiritual values for power and material gain, unlike his first mate, Northerner, Cringle, a man of integrity who believed in fairness and toward the end self-sacrificing.Rutherford appears to have enormous internal conflict concerning anger with his brother, his former slaver, from whom he received a humanist education, and his father for allegedly deserting the family. Added to the conflict was being loyal to his shipmates, but the sorrow felt for the Allmuseri chained in the hold.  He became friend to Allmuseri, Ngonyama, one who readily learned English.  Rutherford realized the joy in the Allmuseri\u2019s lives had diminished, as would their ancient traditions and beliefs. He also realized what he had once enjoyed: women, expensive suits, the latest stage plays, wins at gambling, and parties was nothing new under the sun. Rutherford\u2019s trip to Africa would be far worse than marriage to Isadora.Although I did not like the climax, the book is engrossing with vibrant characters, told in first person and, at times, in narrative. The similes, metaphors, and imageries are exceptional.  Sometimes Rutherford is incoherent, a cue of his emotions.  At this point, the writer\u2019s work is deep and thought provoking. The book contains numerous words from sixteenth century Middle English and a battery of ship terminologies.  As evidenced by his thoughts, Rutherford appeared to have studied under a learned and philosophical man. He considered Falcon a Faustian man. Rutherford used Greek words when describing characters as Icarian or Sisyphean, Parmenidean, and a smattering of Latin, such as causa sui. Make sure you have your dictionary handy. This novel is a good choice for book cIubs. I give the book 4.5 stars. The author served up a book with an unusual flavor."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Loved this book since I first read it over 20 years ago in high school.
