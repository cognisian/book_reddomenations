Having been to Ireland while studying 10 yrs at, Cambridge UK International summer school, was well aware of the goings on of  Trinity scholars (not much different than Cambridge and the \"Neo Pagans\"). Also, my Nana from the old sod, gave me quite a history of her home land so nothing in the book shocked me In fact found it quite believable, as well as enjoyable. Do understand the refusal of the Irish press to publish the book in the religious fervor of the time. Brendan Behan's autobiography is another book akin to Donleavy's. For those who enjoy biographies it will be another Irish escapade."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "This was billed as a comic masterpiece chronicling the doings of a presumably lovable scoundrel. It's nothing of the sort. The protagonist, Sebastian Dangerfield, is one of the most execrable characters I've ever \"met.\" A physically abusive and borderline insane drunk, a sociopath. I generally love dark characters, but Dangerfield has no redeeming qualities that I can identify. He beats his wife, he beats another woman, he attempts to murder his child. He gets drunk, launches incoherent soliloquys that are in no way amusing or insightful, and engages in \"escapades\" that are in essence prolonged bar fights. The other characters in the book serve no purpose other than to enable his behavior - the men by funding him and drinking with him, the women by having sex with him despite his psychological and physical abuse.I did finish the book, in part because Donleavy does have real literary talent, and in part because I couldn't believe a book that's survived this long could be this bad all the way through. This is, however, in no way an enjoyable book. Don't make the mistake I did of slogging through 338 pages of this garbage."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "It had all the extra-ordinary attributes that many reviewers had told me about, but by 30 pages into it I realized that I'd rather spend my time reading fiction that lifts me up or non-fiction that educates me.

It has a sense of humor that fans of Don Quixote will appreciate without having to read 1600 pages. If you are a fan of tilting the occasional pint and always wished to visit Ireland this book's for you. Fans of Wimpy from the Popeye cartoons will also be able to relate to this book.

It is a fairly good piece of entertainment, both funny and maybe am the only one to found it so, weirdly moving. Mr.Smith somehow unfair loneliness touched me. After all, he is seeking for love. The way Donleavy writes it makes it quick in action, so, it is never boring. Shows one can have a fortune and feel inner sadness: because of loneliness? Found laughter and a sort of melancholy in the whole, very understandable. Some passages went fixed in my memory, such as the one of Smith throwing notes through his window while snowing, with his secretary in that bedroom. A singular man? Be sure he is. A remarkable work, as good as \"Fairy tale in New York\" and others. Really, love Donleavy and his unusual stories."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I'm only part way through this book but it is totally hilarious.
