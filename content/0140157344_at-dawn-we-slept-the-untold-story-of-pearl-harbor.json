I cannot put this down!  I wanted to write this review before I forgot.This remarkable book is an achievement because it contains both all of the detail you would expect from such a well-researched project and great writing: the author really brings out the personalities in a great piece of storytelling.What really stands out is the way he simultaneously tracks developments in Japan and the US throughout 1941, moving back and forth from the Japanese officers and politicians to their American counterparts.  As Yamamoto and a small circle of colleague start to get serious about the seemingly impossible dream of a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the Americans keep pondering what the Japanese would do if negotiations broke down.  Again and again the idea of some sort of attack on Pearl Harbor is brought up and then forgotten.  The frustration a typical American reader is likely to feel cannot be understated.  Epic frustration.The detailed examination of the Japanese planning is good not only for those who want to learn about this operation but also, to be coolly objective, it's simply a good case study of people turning over a problem (or opportunity) and looking at it from almost every angle.  The contrast between the Japanese and the Americans could not be more stark.To demonstrate how thorough this book is: I bought it on the off chance that I would find an answer to my own question, which was, did the Japanese not realize that it was possible that sunken ships would simply be hauled out, repaired, and sent out to fight the Japanese again?  This is the cost of trying to sink ships in the shallow waters of a harbor (with all those repair facilities right there) instead of out in the (for all intents and purposes) bottomless ocean.  Anyway, I was sure Yamamoto had considered this (especially since the shallow harbor presented a problem for the Japanese torpedoes).The author did not disappoint.  He shows in a couple of places in his narrative how this issue vexed one of the Japanese officers in particular, who was hoping that some of the ships would be parked in a much deeper harbor not too far away.  The other harbor was included in the planning, but he was to be disappointed that morning when reconnaissance discovered nothing there.  But they did plan for this disappointment: because of the shallow water at Pearl, their mission was not merely to sink the battleships, but to destroy them beyond all hope of repair.  An important distinction affecting the detailed instructions given to the pilots.Even so, when one reads the Japanese side, there is a frustration that mirrors the one you might feel while reading the American side of the story: even Yamamoto acknowledged, explicitly, that an operation against Pearl could only be a delaying tactic in a war that America would certainly win.  This is something that the Japanese worried about but seemed to have no answer for.  The answer might have been in Washington, where Japanese diplomats seemed to be honestly trying to keep the peace, and voiced their frustration with their own government and military for an insistence on imperialist adventures."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I\u2019m a big fan of history, and in particular, World War II history.  I went looking for a book on Pearl Harbor and before I started the search I had heard of Gordon Prange\u2019s history of the event.  Most of the reviews and guides I read kept bringing me back to his book as the definitive study of the event and so I took it on.  Prange served in World War II, served in the military in historical services and personally conducted numerous interviews with most of the Japanese leaders involved in the event.  His personal knowledge of Pearl Harbor was without equal and he produced, but died before seeing it published, this impressive and amazingly detailed history of the event.  His writing style is lucid and readable which makes this tomb accessible.  It is however, beefy and exhaustive.  It is my understanding that two of his students (Prange was also a history professor) edited his text down to the over 750 pages it stands at today.  Prange, to his infinite credit, drills into the amazing currents and tides of the Japanese leadership\u2019s journey to deciding to attack the United States at Pearl.  The thumbnail of the story of how Yamamoto conceived and pushed the plan is well known, but the political gyrations underneath that superficial knowledge are fascinating.  Granted, the long journey to the ultimate consensus to attack Pearl Harbor takes 300 pages.  And then it is another 200 pages before the attack itself takes place.  Throughout these 500 pages you get a detailed look at a cadre of Japanese and American leaders, what drove them, and how they helped shape events.  At its core, the book sheds light on how improbable success was for Yamamoto\u2019s brazen plan and also how again and again the American forces and political leaders failed to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d and execute on the most basic of sound defensive tactics.  Prange does a solid job of bringing to life the attack itself but as a deliberate historian he acknowledges that many of the official reports, from both militaries, are fraught with contradictions and he dutifully reports what he can confirm while straying from representations he cannot substantiate.  This leaves the combat portion of the book paling in comparison to the heft of the steps leading up to the battle and then the onerous post event second guessing by the American forces.  This is an impressive history.  Its heft can make it daunting for the faint of heart.  If you want a quality overview of the event then this book is not for you.  If you want a highly detailed and thorough unpacking of this shocking event that changed the courses of two nations then you have struck pay dirt."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "It was a very detailed report on Pearl Harbor attack.

It is written from both theJapanese and American sides and is about the year leading up to the attack. It is not your usual book of war action like others I have read but rather one written about the military planning and diplomatic activities leading up to our country declaring war on Japan. It is fascinating to hear the names of those involved in the planning of the attack and to get inside their brains. On the other hand it is interesting to read of the differing views of the American key players with regard to our unpreparedness regarding Japan's intended aggression. If you are looking for fascinating historical behind the scenes reading this book gives one an up close and personal account of the key players of on both the Japanese and American sides of the event."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "AOK!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "READ IT AND LEARN."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "very useful. i receive it very fast.
