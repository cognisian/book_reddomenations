I like that it is not on WiFi so it cannot be hacked. The night vision is very clear.  It was easy to hook up.  The signal did disconnect one time but it was easy to reconnect again. I dislike - The screen is like a second sun.  It is SO bright at night.  I have it on Eco-Mode just so I can sleep (the screen goes black until it registers audio).  But then there's a blinking green LED light to let you know the monitor is on, and that too is extremely bright.  I also dislike how flimsy the parent monitor is.  With the cord plugged in, the parent unit becomes unbalanced and tips over easily.Overall, I recommend it for anyone looking for an inexpensive video monitor.  There are probably better ones out there, but not for the price or ease of use."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "this monitor is perfect, small and compact, very good sound and even measures the temp in the room.

It acts like a really expensive monitor. Only thing is it feels like it's cheeply made, so I would be gentle with it."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "\"You get what you pay for\" comes to mind. I've had this monitor for 4 months now. I had a Motorola video monitor before; the price and high reviews pulled me to this monitor for baby #3 (still using the Motorola is other kid's room).  Plus - Battery life is so far really great. Negatives - the receiver makes a weird \"popping\" sound sporatically. Also, the color at night looks like it's constantly trying to adjust in night mode, so the screen is constantly getting darker/lighter. Last, lots of interference in our house (not really sure from what - the Motorola works fine). Overall, the monitor works, but these negatives are really annoying. I'd buy a different brand if I had a do-over."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I have read everything from Tom Robbins, in anyone asked me to pick my best... it would be Jitterbug Perfume!"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Picture much smaller than I anticipated"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is my favorite Tom Robbins novel, and one of my favorite novels by any author.
