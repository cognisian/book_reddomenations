The style and the story absolutely blew my mind, and finally got me into the zombie genre for the first time.  I suspected (correctly) that the author had some history background, because it reads like a genuine collection of real stories surrounding a disturbingly-believable global zombie crisis.  Brooks has given his zombies and his zombie virus a set of firm rules in which to exist, and made them incredibly convincing.  Too bad the producers who bought the rights to the movie couldn't see the potential, but maybe it just can't translate from page to screen.  The book shows both the best and worst of humanity and all the gray areas in between that result from a crisis of unimaginable magnitude, and the shape of the world when it's over.  I really wish he'd write more in this universe - it was absolutely stellar."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Different from conventional zombie war book; tried to outline the complexity of war against zombies.

However, there are some zombie related books or shows I have enjoyed in the past.I didn't really care for this book. I love that they got different actors and directors to do the voice acting for all of the different characters. Some of the voice cast that I knew of was Alan Alda, David Ogden Stiers, Alfred Molina and Mark Hamil to name a few. But I found my mind wondering often while listening to this. I also found it confusing that there seemed to be two different ways they referred to the zombies, G's and Zach's, even by the same person. What was the point of the two names and did they ever explain where the names came from? A lot of the narrative seemed to be similar just from different people's perspectives. I did like the story about the soldiers who worked with K9's though.I feel like this needed less perspectives and more of a continuous story."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Good.....thanks"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "On par with TWD to depict \u201cwhat if\u201d the Zombies came.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.\r\n\r\nRanging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.\r\n\r\nMost of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, \u201cBy excluding the human factor, aren\u2019t we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn\u2019t the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as \u2018the living dead\u2019?\u201d", "asin": "0307346617", "rank": "10627", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51iP%2Behot4L.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
