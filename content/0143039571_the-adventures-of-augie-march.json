So, it was with some hesitation I picked up Saul Bellow\u2019s \u201cThe Adventures of Augie March.\u201d I was delightfully surprised at how much I enjoyed this novel. Mr. Bellow writes with a beauty and skill that does not distract from the story but makes his story more personal and valuable to the reader.Many older novels, though beautifully written lack a compelling story that is relevant to the twenty-first century reader. \u201cThe Adventures of Augie March\u201d gives today\u2019s readers a taste of the first half of twentieth century America in a way that is both relatable and entertaining. Augie March and most of the characters who interact with him in this story are not at all loveable people. But what they do have is a certain authenticity that Mr. Bellow systematically and skillfully reveals to the reader. These characters through their actions and a parlance steeped in speech of their times that vividly portray life in the 1920\u2019s, 30\u2019s and forties.Tom Parker does a masterful job in narrating this book. His performance added much to the enjoyment of the Audible edition.Recommended: Yes."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "American Novel.  Period.  Look no further.

Augie March is one of the unique figures in American literature, a follower who constantly finds himself the object of manipulation by others. While some readers have insisted that they found him unlikeable, I felt a great deal of sympathy toward him and found myself pulling for him. Augie is also self destructive and that infuriated me at times, but I eventually came to expect it.I will say that the opening chapters made me work. This is not a quick read. But once I fell into Bellows's style and got accustomed to the philosophical monologues both from Augie and other characters , I found it hard to put down."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A masterpiece.
