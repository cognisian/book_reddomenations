The Kindle version omits the margin citations, which attribute quoted passages to their sources. To me, these attributions are essential to the text. It was not until I saw a print copy from the library that I realized what had been missing in the electronic version. When I went back and re-read the passages with attribution, I had an entirely different experience of reading the book.So unless the publisher revises the Kindle edition to include these references, do NOT buy on Kindle. Get the print copy instead.An engaging and brave work that deserves to be read in its original, nuanced format."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "EVERYONE should read this."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Powerful and potent.

For me, it was so bad and boring that I couldnt even finish it and the reading was painful, slow and boring. So cleanly this is not a book for everyone.

At its center is a romance: the story of the author's relationship with the artist Harry Dodge. This story, which includes Nelson's account of falling in love with Dodge, who is fluidly gendered, as well as her journey to and through a pregnancy, offers a firsthand account of the complexities and joys of (queer) family-making. \r\n\r\nWriting in the spirit of public intellectuals such as Susan Sontag and Roland Barthes, Nelson binds her personal experience to a rigorous exploration of what iconic theorists have said about sexuality, gender, and the vexed institutions of marriage and child-rearing. Nelson's insistence on radical individual freedom and the value of caretaking becomes the rallying cry of this thoughtful, unabashed, uncompromising book.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaggie Nelson is one of the most electrifying writers at work in America today, among the sharpest and most supple thinkers of her generation.\u201d  The Guardian", "asin": "1555977359", "rank": "10330", "city": "Los Angeles", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51joIqA3RML.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
