It is this feeling what often takes me from thinking 'this is a good book' all the way to 'this is excellent.' The genres it is usually catalogued under run from Latin to Experimental, but I'm here to say that it should just be under Excellent Fiction. The author has a creative genius that transcends geography and time and returns the novel to what it should be, something new and fresh - the word novel should, after all, stand for something. All the praises to this book, one that I'll be happy to recommend to anyone looking for original literary and emotional research."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This has got to be the most bizarre novel I have ever read.

According to Plascencia, the novel is \u201ca war-novel, a memoir, it\u2019s about immigration, it\u2019s a meta-fiction, and it\u2019s a love-story.\u201d The heart of the novel is built around Federico de la Fe and his daughter, Little Merced, who leave Mexico for the United States after Federico\u2019s wife, Merced, leaves him. Once in the U.S., Federico bands together with the locals, forming a group called the EMF who wage a war \u201cagainst Saturn, against sadness, and against omniscient narration.\u201d The novel is written in three sections, each including several chapters. Each chapter enlists the perspectives of a variety of characters, including Saturn, the omniscient narrator. The pages are laid out in columns, and, at one point, words are blacked out or, in certain editions, are cut from the page. The narrator himself makes an appearance as well.
