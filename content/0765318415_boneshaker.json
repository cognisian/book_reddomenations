For steampunk lovers this is a must read.i can't wait to dig into the others in this series!!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I gave this book 4/5 stars because it just fell short for me. The story is an alternate universe tale set in zombie infested Seattle during the late 1800's.  A woman, Briar, travels from the safety of the Outskirts back across the protective wall into the unknown world of Seattle to search for her teen son. My favorite character was Briar and I think if the story had focused on Briar and her tremendous backstory, it would have been an outstanding book. Instead we got a whole lot of narrative about secondary characters who were interesting but nowhere near as great as Briar and her family. Too bad because I really wanted to only hear about Briar, her mad scientist husband who started the whole mess, and Briar's father who seemed like a Wyatt Earp type of character. I would recommend anyway because it was still an entertaining book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I absolutely loved this story.  And I'm an old dude.  I picked it up to satiate my new appetite for all things steampunk.  Those who complain about silly details need to chill out and just appreciate the overall storytelling.  Who freakin cares how long it actually takes for beans to cook?!?  I'll definitely check out the author's other works."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Cherie Priest's backdrop for this alternative history/steampunk novel (the first in the series) is quite enjoyable.  I found the other books in the series to be similarly engaging as well."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Boneshaker is a great read. It starts with an entertaining beggining that gets you hooked instantly. This book is ation packed and interesting, but I would not recommend  it to children under the age of 13, for it's use of swearing. Also because the plot may be hard to follow and understand for children. Yet I do suggest it to anyone who is persistent and patient enough to read it, for it is pretty long.  Some people don't like the beginning and quit right then and there, which,honestly, is stupid. Read the entire book before you judge it. One person said, ' It's so bad I could'nt get past 25% of the book.\"' How do you know it won't get better? In fact, it does get better. A lot better, in my opinion. So in conclusion, I think that you should give this book a try. Oh, if you're over 12, of course."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I absolutely love this book and recommend it often to friends and family.

Characters and story were too predictable and the \"fog/mist\", if anything, took away from the story. It left little for your minds eye to imagine.It had a few points where I struggled to push through. It's not a bad book, but it's not awesome. I see a lot of potential from the writer though and will look for more of her books to give her a second chance."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Stupid kid runs into zombie infested inner city, clueless parent follows.

Anxious to compete, Russian prospectors commissioned inventor Leviticus Blue to create a great machine that could mine through Alaska's ice. Thus was Dr. Blue's Incredible Bone-Shaking Drill Engine born.\r\n\r\nBut on its first test run the Boneshaker went terribly awry, destroying several blocks of downtown Seattle and unearthing a subterranean vein of blight gas that turned anyone who breathed it into the living dead.\r\n\r\nNow it is sixteen years later, and a wall has been built to enclose the devastated and toxic city. Just beyond it lives Blue's widow, Briar Wilkes. Life is hard with a ruined reputation and a teenaged boy to support, but she and Ezekiel are managing. Until Ezekiel undertakes a secret crusade to rewrite history.\r\n\r\nHis quest will take him under the wall and into a city teeming with ravenous undead, air pirates, criminal overlords, and heavily armed refugees. And only Briar can bring him out alive.\r\n\r\n\u201cEverything you'd want in such a volume and much more.... It's full of buckle and has swash to spare, and the characters are likable and the prose is fun. This is a hoot from start to finish, pure mad adventure.\u201d Cory Doctorow", "asin": "B007YWEZNU", "rank": "4037562", "city": "Seattle", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31oqdqcxFpL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
