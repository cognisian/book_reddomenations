The flood water distribution graphic is what sold me on the book.  It told the entire story of the Katrina in one picture.  In this case 1 picture is worth a Milliion words.

More than twenty essays assemble a chorus of vibrant voices, including geographers, scholars of sugar and bananas, the city's remarkable musicians, prison activists, environmentalists, Arab and Native voices, and local experts, as well as the coauthors\u2019 compelling contributions. \r\n\r\nFeaturing 22 full-color two-page-spread maps, Unfathomable City plumbs the depths of this major tourist destination, pivotal scene of American history and culture and, most recently, site of monumental disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and the BP oil spill.\r\n\r\nThe innovative maps\u2019 precision and specificity shift our notions of the Mississippi, the Caribbean, Mardi Gras, jazz, soils and trees, generational roots, and many other subjects, and expand our ideas of how any city is imagined and experienced. Together with the inspired texts, they show New Orleans as both an imperiled city\u2014by erosion, crime, corruption, and sea level rise\u2014and an ageless city that lives in music as a form of cultural resistance. \r\n\r\nCompact, lively, and completely original, Unfathomable City takes readers on a tour that will forever change the way they think about place.", "asin": "0520274040", "rank": "66185", "city": "New Orleans", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41hIh-pjswL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
