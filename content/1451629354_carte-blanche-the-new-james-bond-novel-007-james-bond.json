They're great, easy reads. However, many of them have parts that make you wince with embarrassment - the objectifying of women, the sweeping generalization of countrymen, the chain smoking, heavy drinking etc... And from books written in the middle of the 20th century it was OK.The problem was keeping that character in the 21st century. What Jeffery Deaver did with the character is probably the real accomplishment of this book. Bond's real problems in this story are red tape, incompetent competing co-workers and budget constraints. He doesn't smoke and sometimes decides to restrain from himself. In some ways this is more like \"Son of Bond\" and it works well.So, why not 5 stars? I didn't like the pop culture references - they felt a little forced. Plus, some of the action scenes could have been a little more descriptive.I did like the parent back story (is that now cannon?). It's a pity there wasn't any more in this timeline."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Well done!

Constantly the author is trying to sneak in some attempted wits, pop culture references and other mumbo jumbo which doesn't stick because its delivered in a forced manner. The storyline becomes instantly forgettable due to never finding its voice let alone having too many villains to even find time to breathe and let all the details sink in."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "OK James Bond book but not as good as Fleming."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "In spite of mixed reviews, I enjoyed Deaver's approach to Bond in a more modern setting.
