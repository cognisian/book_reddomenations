The story takes place during a single day at the WTO protests in Seattle in 1999. The main character, Victor, is a bright, itinerant, bi-racial 19-year-old who left his Seattle home at age 16 after his mother died. He has traveled the world and seen the best and worst of what it contains. Now he finds himself back in Seattle\u2014where his father happens to be chief of police\u2014in the midst of the WTO protest. Through the eyes of several characters\u2014protesters and police alike, and most notably Victor and his father\u2014we are taken through the events of a day as the protest devolves into chaos and violence. What do we owe one another as individuals and nations, the story asks. How do we live a just life? The book reads like a glorious, if somewhat repetitive, rant, full of love and despair for the human condition. Yapa\u2019s embrace of humanity reminds me of Walt Whitman, his deployment of language is reminiscent of the work of Colum McCann, Yapa\u2019s teacher. I look forward to his next novel."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Decent debut, hot-breathed writing, nuanced, challenging, filled with humanity.

I honestly don't like it and was really hard to understand because it kinda reads like a poem. But I understand the message it's trying to give and I appreciate it.

This was powerful writing, an intense story and amazing understanding of being human. The story is told through eyes of a few characters--and dear lord, does Dr. Charles Wickramsinghe provide much relief from the heart pumping chaos of the protest.

He believes he's found both when he returns home to Seattle only to be swept up in a massive protest. With young, biracial Victor o one side of the barricades and his estranged father--the white chief of police--on the opposite, the day descends into chaos, capturing in its confusion the activists, police, bystanders, and citizens from all around the world who'd arrived that day brimming with hope. By the day's end, they have all committed acts they never thought possible.\r\n\r\nAs heartbreaking as it is pulse-pounding, Yapa's virtuosic debut asks profound questions about the power of empathy in our hyper-connected modern world, and the limits of compassion, all while exploring how far we must go for family, for justice, and for love.\r\n\r\n\"A fantastic debut novel.... What is so enthralling about this novel is its syncopated riff of empathy as the perspective jumps around these participants--some peaceful, some violent, some determined, some incredulous... Yapa creates a fluid sense of the riot as it washes over the city. Your Heart is a Muscle the Size of a Fist ultimately does for WTO protests what Norman Mailer's Armies of the Night did for the 1967 March on the Pentagon, gathering that confrontation in competing visions of what happened and what it meant.\" Washington Post", "asin": "0316386553", "rank": "59943", "city": "Seattle", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510VGQwJlDL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
