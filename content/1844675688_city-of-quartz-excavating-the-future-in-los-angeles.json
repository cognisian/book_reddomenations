To its official boosters, \u201cLos Angeles brings it all together.\u201d To detractors, LA is a sunlit mortuary where \u201cyou can rot without feeling it.\u201d To Mike Davis, the author of this fiercely elegant and wide- ranging work of social history, Los Angeles is both utopia and dystopia, a place where the last Joshua trees are being plowed under to make room for model communities in the desert, where the rich have hired their own police to fend off street gangs, as well as armed Beirut militias. \r\n\r\nIn City of Quartz, Davis reconstructs LA\u2019s shadow history and dissects its ethereal economy. He tells us who has the power and how they hold on to it. He gives us a city of Dickensian extremes, Pynchonesque conspiracies, and a desperation straight out of Nathaniel West a city in which we may glimpse our own future mirrored with terrifying clarity.\r\n\r\nIn this new edition, Davis provides a dazzling update on the city\u2019s current status.", "asin": "1844675688", "rank": "99169", "city": "Los Angeles", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511YBouSJJL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
