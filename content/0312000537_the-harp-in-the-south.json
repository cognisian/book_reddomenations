This product is a fraud and all 5 star ratings are fake! I\ufe0f  could not believe my eyes when I\ufe0f opened this terrible product! It looked like it was purchased at the dollar tree then shamefully resold on Amazon for $11.99!!!! Insane. I\ufe0f bought this product and even gave it a shot just to be sure it was what I\ufe0f suspected. I\ufe0f have had a mosquito problem inside. Left it in for 24 hours and not a single mosquito was killed. Not to mention it is this huge awkward LED light you have to screw into a light socket SOMEWHERE! The only place that would fit it was a lamp and it made the lamp light ugly purple. Definitely returned."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Such nice reviews, but after 2 weeks I\u2019m still being bitten and not a single dead mosquito can be seen in the zapper section. I bought this because I previously bought another brand that works great and has killed hundreds of mosquitos that I remove from time to time with the included brush. Unfortunately, its blue light is gradually losing strength. The Smarlance (What\u2019s in a name?) is bright blue alright, but doesn\u2019t work at all."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "BUYER BEWARE - SORT BY VERIFIED PURCHASES - THERE ARE ZERO - NONE - NOT A SINGLE PURCHASE HAS BEEN MADE FOR THE 103 5 STAR REVIEWS!!

It is a Chemical free solution to a pesky mosquitoes problem. I really couldn't bear another summer haunted by mosquitoes. This little irritating creature were everywhere last summer.

Missus tells of Hugh and Margaret, their early courtship and the history of each family, both Irish and Roman Catholic. The writing is on the wall regarding Hugh Darcy early on and his long suffering, although staunch and lovingly supportive wife Margaret.The Harp in the South is about their time as a family living at Number Twelve and a Half, Plymouth St Surry Hills. Life is a struggle, the houses are vermin ridden, dirty and the residents are poverty stricken but there are still acts of kindness amongst the squalor, pubs and dregs of society.In Poor Man's Orange life has come full circle for Margaret and Hugh and it is their children and grandchildren who carry the story to the end.These are novels that pull at the heart strings, there is love and laughter, cruelty and thoughtfulness. A snap shot of the past. There are pockets of humour where I laughed out loud which relieved the bleakness of the novels overall.Sad to come to the end of the Darcy's, they had a story worth telling."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great for us in summer.

It has multiple ways to used it like camping, garden porch or at home use. it's also useful if we want to eat out on our balcony in the evenings; sitting in the corner, it quietly and effectively attracts all of the nasties.
