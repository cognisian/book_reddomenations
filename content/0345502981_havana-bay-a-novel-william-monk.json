I\u2019m not sure, but he\u2019s certainly in the same league. Havana Bay has him putting his research skills and his imagination on the line again and succeeding brilliantly. Just as he imagined Russia and Russians flawlessly in the previous three books, he does the same in a Cubano-Russian setting this time. I\u2019m again floored. I\u2019ve been to Cuba, more than once, and I couldn\u2019t possibly imagine how he got the kind of detail that he\u2019s showing in the book. And not just physical detail, but details about the inner lives and pressures in a closed society. How does he do it? I was stunned by Gorky Park, his first Arkady Renko novel, and I\u2019m just as amazed by Havana Bay. What a talent. It must be fun to research and imagine endlessly, slowly putting it together. But it\u2019s a grind as well. I\u2019m envious, either way.Anyway, Renko hits rock bottom this time, worse than being on the slime line in Polar Star, but he manages to claw his way back up, only to see it all\u2026. Well, no need to spoil anything. Another great piece of work from the absolute master.

His investigation introduces him to a beautiful Cuban policewoman; to the rituals of Santeria; to an American fugitive and a group of ruthless mercenaries. In this place where all things Russian are despised, where Hemingway fished and the KGB flourished, where the hint of music is always in the air, Arkady finds a trail of deceit that reaches halfway around the world\u2013and a reason to relish his own life again.", "asin": "0345502981", "rank": "758883", "city": "Havana", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51zBnaps5-L.jpg", "country": "Cuba", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
