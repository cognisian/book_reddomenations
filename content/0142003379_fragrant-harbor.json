I knew nothing about this time period or Hong Kong, so I found it historically interesting.

Boy, was I disappointed!  As some other reviewers have noted, the book is disjointed; about a third covers one character; another third covers another, totally unrelated character; and the final third or so is about a character who sort of brings together all three.  However, the characters are flat, stick figures, and while Mr. Lanchester is widely regarded as a fine author, much of the plot is flat too.  For example, the lead character in the middle section of the book stays in Hong Kong during the horrors of the Japanese occupation in WWII, but there's no drama or even suspense.  The final third of the book is even worse; the lead character in that portion seems to narrate his life, but it's really not very interesting.Finally, the atmosphere of Hong Kong itself is unimaginative and boring.A real disappointment."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Lots of facinating content, but sometimes disconnected."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Almost, but not as brilliant as his \"A Debt to Pleasure\".And that is the Lanchester book to read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "In a departure from his Euro-centric novels, Lanchester writes of Hong Kong before World War II, during the Japanese occupation, and through to the hand-off of the British colony to the Chinese.  But, in his remarkable way, he finds a point of view that is perfect.  Tom Stewart has no prospects in England so sets out by tramp steamer for far-away Hong Kong.  He is joined by a bank employee, a devoted couple, and two nuns, one of whom teaches him Chinese as the ship makes its way to the Orient.  He finds work in a bank, which makes him useful to the Japanese when they take over, but also puts him in between the suddenly-captured English and the Chinese underclass of the island, and \u2026 one of the nuns.

Aboard ship, he becomes the pawn in a wager between a bluff businessman and a Chinese missionary nun, who bets she can teach him Cantonese on the six-week voyage out. What begins as friendship turns into solace and then a passion that only individual vows can remit. \r\n\r\nFragrant Harbor takes the reader from the intrigue and double-dealing of the 1930s through the savagery of the Japanese occupation to contemporary Hong Kong, crossroads of international trade and finance and waystation for laundering the dirty money of warlords, drug runners, and Chinese triads. The novel ends three years after the Mainland takeover, with Hong Kong as greedy, corrupt, and corrupting as when Stewart first landed there. \r\n\r\nWriting with the same fine style and observant eye that distinguished his previous novels, John Lanchester depicts a tumultuous time and place and then peoples it with extraordinary characters. The result is a novel that proves he is amongour most versatile and talented contemporary novelists-indeed, as The New York Times wrote, \"Lanchester is a commanding writer.\"", "asin": "0142003379", "rank": "912302", "city": "Hong Kong", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518XNAWFMKL.jpg", "country": "China", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
