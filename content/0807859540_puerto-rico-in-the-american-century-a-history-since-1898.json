This book reads more like an unbiased textbook, offering the reader an excellent history lesson on how the European nations and the United States impacted the island of Puerto Rico economically, socially, and politically.  The many U.S. acts such as the Foraker and Jones Acts explained in the American history books fail to mention how they directly affect the colonized territories.  You may need to have a supplemental reference close by if you are not familiar with some of the terms the author uses (colonos, hacendado, etc.)."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Must read if you are puerto rican."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It's taken me a few months to read the entire book, but it was worth it.  My parents left PR in 1945.  I turned one year old in Caracas, Venezuela, where we lived for the next 15 years.  As i was growing up, PR was gradually transformed into a mythical Bali-Hai, a paradise on earth.  Nothing critical was ever said about it. Both my parents were pro-independence. When we returned to PR and I got involved in both politics and the UPR protests of the 1960's, I saw my family be persecuted as a result.  I  left once more, moving to NYC permanently.  All of this is necessary to explain the impact this book has had on me.  If \"War Against All Puerto Ricans\" focused on  political persecution (my family included), \"Puerto Rico in the American Century\" provided me with that part of Puerto Rican history I never did learn academically.  Now I understand what my parents were not about to discuss : the reasons they left the island, first for Venezuela and then for the USA.  Now I have a true sense of the depths of betrayal the Puerto Rican people suffered not only at the hands of Empire but at the hands of the Empire's lackeys, from Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn and Romero Barcel\u00f3 to  the current administration.  I found the \"Conclusions\" realistically disturbing. When all is said and done, PR may never be able to be completely free from its invaders. ."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I came to the US from Puerto Rico at age ten.  During the past few years I read a few books about PR. because I felt Idid not knowmuch history about the island.  Puerto Rico in the American Century was very informative and I learned many details about the huistory of PR which I did not know.

Puerto Rico in the American Century explores Puerto Ricans in the diaspora as well as the island residents, who experience an unusual and daily conundrum: they consider themselves a distinct people but are part of the American political system; they have U.S. citizenship but are not represented in the U.S. Congress; and they live on land that is neither independent nor part of the United States. \r\n\r\nHighlighting both well-known and forgotten figures from Puerto Rican history, Ayala and Bernabe discuss a wide range of topics, including literary and cultural debates and social and labor struggles that previous histories have neglected. Although the island's political economy remains dependent on the United States, the authors also discuss Puerto Rico's situation in light of world economies. Ayala and Bernabe argue that the inability of Puerto Rico to shake its colonial legacy reveals the limits of free-market capitalism, a break from which would require a renewal of the long tradition of labor and social activism in Puerto Rico in connection with similar currents in the United States.
