The descriptions can be a little too poetic sometimes however making it hard to concentrate and get the information I was looking for. It's an important book however to have if you want to learn about this amazing area from someone who lived with it before the modern era."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This classic is so beautifully written the language and evocative imagery almost distract. Instead they cast a profound spell of enchantment over the reader. This book should be required reading for every would-be scientist, environmentalist or apprentice writer. They'll emerge with a deep, deep appreciation for  the majesty of the natural world in general and the Florida wetlands in particular. And for Marjorie Stoneman Douglas, who died in 1998 at the age of 108 but lives on in this eloquent masterpiece it took her five years to write."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "So important to understand this history and inspire us to continue to save and support the River of Grass!

Included are 2 maps.\r\n\r\nIn addition to researching and writing this book, author Marjory Stoneman Douglas (1890-1998) played an important leadership role in the effort to protect the Everglades from development, and she was active in other social causes as well (civil rights, women's rights) during the course of her long life. She was the recipient of numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1983.", "asin": "1539990729", "rank": "485037", "city": "Miami", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bz4%2BQGebL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
