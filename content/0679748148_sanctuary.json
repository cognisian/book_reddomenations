This book was suspenseful and entertaining, but I feel like the author was doing the typical murder mystery/suspense/romance thing and hadn't really found her groove yet when this was written.  The relationships were a little too non-consensual at first, the women were strong but not the well-rounded characters she writes now., and she only did that three-phrase thing in conversations that I consider her hallmark in one place that I noticed. Fun to read and see how much she's evolved since this was written though."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of her bests!  Intriguing, many twists and terns.
