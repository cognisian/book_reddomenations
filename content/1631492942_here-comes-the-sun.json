Just when you think it can't get any more depressing, it pulls you down further.  But I thought more about it and that isn't a commentary on how well the book is written.  To be fair, the story was engrossing--I was rooting for (some of ) the characters but every time I did, something awful would happen.  People here have commented that they had a hard time reading the dialect but I listened to the audiobook, which is a great way around that.  I was VERY disappointed in the ending, as the author goes into some detail about what happens to one of the main characters and virtually nothing is said about the others.  Unless she's waiting for the sequel?  Lots of unanswered questions, things not wrapped up.  That said, if you don't mind depressing stories that don't have happy endings, you might like this book."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "no review"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This book was so beautifully written (though hard to read sometimes given the nature of the story).

At an opulent resort in Montego Bay, Margot hustles to send her younger sister, Thandi, to school. \r\n\r\nTaught as a girl to trade her sexuality for survival, Margot is ruthlessly determined to shield Thandi from the same fate. When plans for a new hotel threaten their village, Margot sees not only an opportunity for her own financial independence but also perhaps a chance to admit a shocking secret: her forbidden love for another woman. \r\n\r\nAs they face the impending destruction of their community, each woman\u2014fighting to balance the burdens she shoulders with the freedom she craves\u2014must confront long-hidden scars. From a much-heralded new writer, Here Comes the Sun offers a dramatic glimpse into a vibrant, passionate world most outsiders see simply as paradise.\r\n\r\n\"[A] lithe, artfully-plotted debut....Margot is one of the reasons to read this book. She is a startling, deeply memorable character. All of Ms. Dennis-Benn\u2019s women are.
