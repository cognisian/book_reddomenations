I do not understand why it has so many high ratings. My husband bought this book to share this gem of Columbian literature with me because I do not speak Spanish fluently. The minute we picked the book up and started reading it, it was obvious that it was a direct and literal translation from Spanish. Many sentences do not make any sense in English. We went to the Translators Note at the beginning of the book for some clarification only to find that he is listed as Senior C.M. Silva LLD. I'm not sure if they meant Se\u00f1or or C.M. Silva, Sr. That basically sums up the challenges with this English translation. Also, curiously, the last page says that it was printed in San Bernardino, CA, the day it was ordered.
