I've probably bought 4 copies by now to give to people.  Tons of stories about Portland's history and personal stories.

I've read several of his other books and they mostly confound and confuse me with some amazing literary skill creeping in at the edges of the weirdness.This book is just straight up weird and doesn't pretend to be anything else.  It doesn't pretend to be high literature.  It's just an incredibly strange man writing about his love affair with an incredible strange city, Portland.  Because I write travel books and blogs and articles myself, I am always interested to read the travelogues of others.  While I wouldn't visit most of the places in the book, I found it to be a very interesting and funny read.  Most of the book focuses on gay bars and drug hangouts, which is maybe not the way to promote tourism but that isn't really the author's intention.  His intention is just to give a shout out to the uniqueness and quirkiness of Portland.  If you like smatterings of history thrown in with smatterings of fact and travel, you'll probably like this."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I grew up in the Portland area, but hadn't heard of most of the stories in this book.

How do you get to the Apocalypse Caf\u00e9?\r\n\r\nIn the closest thing he may ever write to an autobiography, Chuck Palahniuk provides answers to all these questions and more as he takes you through the streets, sewers, and local haunts of Portland, Oregon.

No other travel guide will give you this kind of access to \u201ca little history, a little legend, and a lot of friendly, sincere, fascinating people who maybe should\u2019ve kept their mouths shut.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere are strange personal museums, weird annual events, and ghost stories. Tour the tunnels under downtown Portland. Visit swingers\u2019 sex clubs, gay and straight. See Frances Gabe\u2019s famous 1940s Self-Cleaning House. Look into strange local customs like the I-Tit-a-Rod Race and the Santa Rampage. Learn how to talk like a local in a quick vocabulary lesson.
