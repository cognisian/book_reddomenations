Every line is cadenced, every paragraph holds a memorable metaphor and image.  Written in the early 1940's while Smart was in the throes of passionate obsession, it is hot without being salacious.  It doesn't have the overt sexuality of Ana\u00efs Nin, but is nonetheless just as erotic.  Smart fell in love with the poet George Barker in the most intimate fashion -- through the written word.  By reading a volume of his poetry.  Although they never married (he already had a wife), they went on to have four children together, but this was written just after the birth of her first daughter.  This edition also contains The Assumption of Rogues and Rascals, written in 1978, which contains vignettes of what it was like living in England post World War II, but that doesn't carry the heat of Grand Central.  It also contains a very informative introduction by Brigid Brophy."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This book is not for everybody.  It's poetic prose, so it is, yes, purple.

Now that I've read it I can see the connection. There are actually lines from this books which got used as lyrics in some Smiths songs.The book stands on its on merits however. The writing is beautiful and poetic. The emotions are real and raw although not always admirable. The narrative loosely follows the author's affair with a married man, her crippling love for him regardless of all common sense and social taboos. She disgraces herself in the eyes of her family and society. She gives birth to illegitimate children by her lover while he forsakes his own wife and lawful children.To call this love intense would be a massive understatement. To call it rational or sensible would be just plain wrong. To deny it is beautiful would be blind."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Ms Smart writes poetic prose, and you have to like this genre to enjoy the book.
