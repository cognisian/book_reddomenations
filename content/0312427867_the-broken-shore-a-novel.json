Dry, understated, and laugh-out-loud funny.  It has that reserved country Australia larrikin tone... with all the warmth of humanity shining through.  Great plot.  Page-turner.  Beautifully descriptive, without being laborious or pretentious.  Highly recommend to readers and would-be authors.  I love the overall message... try 99 times... useless... then try one more.  It\u2019s a ripper of a yarn."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Some of the prose was quite engaging but overall it was not the best crime fiction I have read. The characters were uninteresting and underdeveloped and there were too many which did not advance the plot.

I'm not averse to learning new mannerisms of speech and can usually catch the flow of a book that is written with vernacular, but the Aussie verbiage requires constant flipping to the glossary. I am thankful for the glossary, but even with it, I struggle with the writing style. Here I am waiting for something to grip my attention but am stumbling through 100 pages of \"He walked to the corner. On the way he passed two milk bars, three grocery stores, a chemist, a lady waiting for a cab, and a brothel.\"Every time he walks into a room he \"opens the window, walks to the fridge, takes out some juice, adjusts the curtain, thinks about sitting down.\" If those redundant and unnecessary phrases were edited out, the book would be 1/3 as long. Hard book to read."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Well written, characters well done; interactions between the characters generally excellent; dogs fascinating - until their behavior and attached prose become too repetitive; and plot very good, not tremendously original, but having its several elements very well blended and very well presented - until it becomes obvious what the original crime was and who did it, and the only thing left to wade through the unfolding of that and learn which of the surviving victims did the the final crime.In terms of the rating: it was a five most of the way through, then slid to a three. And ended with an enormous flaw: it didn't end. The climactic action scene, set up to show the enormous flaw in our hero, ends in the prose before the action ends, so we have to make assumptions about what happened. Extremely bad technique: I've encountered it previously only in a wretched American thriller."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Awesome"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A compelling and interesting police procedural set in Port Munro and Cromarty--two small towns near Melbourne, Australia. The characters are three dimensional--though much of their pasts are alluded to rather than specifically detailed. This can be confusing sometimes. Also, the Australian dialect is occasionally incomprehensible despite the helpful glossary. Generally the meaning can be parsed from context, though. A very good book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "First Temple novel I have read, enjoyed this one and ordered another.

It is Asia with indigenous people, surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, and oppressed by a western culture. Temple is a very intelligent writer.
