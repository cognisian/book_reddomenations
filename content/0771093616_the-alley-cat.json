This book is passionate, compassionate, humorous, grotesque, bizarre and epic in every regard. The language zips along with wonderful ingenuity and the characters  are magnificent. An earlier reviewer mentioned two brilliant characters,  but there are many, many other memorable characters in this wonderful book.  Up until the last five pages of this very large novel, you are held  wondering how it will all end. A great novel worthy in tribute to such  luminous writers as Dickens or Thackery. You will roll on the floor  laughing, and you will hold your breath at some of the more tragic moments.  One of my favourite novels of all time. A great read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The Alley Cat is a book that is altogether encouraging, discouraging, and a funny, poignant tale of learning to stand on  your own two feet.
