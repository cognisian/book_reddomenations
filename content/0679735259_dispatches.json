I think those reviewers were expecting the linear \"...landed in Saigon...gooks in the wire...as I boarded the transport back to The World\" story.Herr makes it clear he is a writer, not a reporter or historian. He is writing about the Vietnam war, not recording or reporting. Specifically he is writing about his experience as a war correspondent and not any particular unit, battle or individual. There are no footnotes that would make it \"scholarly.\" It could be called fiction but realize that fiction is not synonymous with lie. The happenings in the book happened.The opening section is titled \"Breathing In.\" I found it difficult to read because it is written as a stream of consciousness and I couldn't get the writer's voice. I had to go back and re-read each paragraph. I am going to specifically re-read the whole section. I would bet the audiobook version of this gave the voice talent fits. This section is the only reason I didn't give the book five stars and I suspect some readers give up on the book. Keep reading because the rest of the book is a home run.Many of the characters in the book are representative of actual people he encountered so you not find their names on The Wall although, in a sense, they are. The other war correspondents he encounters are actual people and stories can be followed up on with a google search.Michael Herr is a credited writer on Apocalypse Now and Full Metal Jacket. Influences from Breathing In seem to be in Apocalypse while much of the remainder of the book will spark images of Full Metal Jacket.I recommend this book. If you get hung up with Breathing In, skip to the next section. The writing on Hue and Khe Sanh is a much more 'traditional' and hard you'll find it hard to put down. The last section focuses on combat photographers and war correspondents."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Read it twice in High School when it came out.  Blew me away.  Re-read it 10 yrs ago.  I can't say I've read better.  Just a great book, a classic. Neil Sheehan's \"A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam\u200e\" is a runner up.A lot of the real people Herr met in Vietnam can be found in the characters like the movies Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now.  He played a role in the screenplays of both.  Since Herr and his colleagues were press, they could hop all over Vietnam on choppers and witness the war with a multifaceted view.  So when you hear some revisionist Vet say I never saw that, we never did that, you can answer ya well maybe you didn't, but Herr did witness it.  You were in one unit, he was flying all over the country."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Astonishingly well written by a journalist who actually lived the war. No BS here.
