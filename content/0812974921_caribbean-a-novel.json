It has been sitting on my shelf for years. It has left me wanting to read more of his books. I like long books, but this was even long for me. A massive tome and with small print in the hardcover on top of that.I don\u2019t understand how he could have had the time to research for one book, let alone the many he has written.The different chapters, some very long, are like short stories with a lot of history mixed in with great plots. You hated when each one ended, although some of them interweaved together. They take place in different time periods on different islands. It really was disturbing and sad the way people in history have been so utterly cruel to one another. Makes me want to resign from the human race.\ud83d\ude1eI must say though, that he is king of the run-on sentence."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Michener writes blockbuster historical novels.

I've read several other Michener novels and really enjoy the way he brings the area alive, my personal favorite being Alaska.  You have to get into a frame of mind that when you begin to read one of these novels, you need to enjoy the voyage and not be in a hurry to get to the end.  The one thing that Michener does that takes getting used to for me is his long sentences.  They are grammatically correct, but  seem to run on more than I like.  I gave this one a 4 star because I didn't think it was his best, but it was very good."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "All of Michener's historical novels are great - you just can't hurry the read. I'd you've traveled the Caribbean, studied new world exploration, or just like adventure this book is for you. Written from many different perspectives, locations, and across the centuries."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is one of Michener's better offerings. It is typical of his narrative development using a kind of \"leap frog\" technique where a character from an earlier episode may appear or have a descendant in a later one. The map of the Caribbean lends itself to both parallel and sequential narrative threads. In many of the episodes the good and the noble die at an early age and the venal, opportunistic, and violent thrive. Sometimes there is payback and sometimes, not often enough, but surprisingly and in accord with reality, the good guys win. Michener's theme of a more perfect world peopled by the progeny from many genetic and ethnic mixes has ample opportunity for development in this novel. His island, All Saints, is a kind of \"Everyman\" of Caribbean locations. \"Caribbean\" is worth the voyage."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Did not the book.it is an old cover and does not look like all the other Michener books."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "satisfied"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Very much like reading a textbook.
