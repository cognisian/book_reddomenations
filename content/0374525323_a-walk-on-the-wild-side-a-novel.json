I had read that he had begun this book as a kind of sequel to an earlier novel, but then gave up on that idea and decided to create a more farcical kind of satire. I hadn't expected to be able to actually see this change of direction in progress. It does feel like Algren began writing one book, a more sympathetic dust bowl novel, akin to Steinbeck, and then decide to switch to an adventure story like a debauched and impoverished Candide. It doesn't seem like he went back and rewrote the early sections of the book to fit with its later style. He just left it as it is. (I don't know if this is the case; it just feels that way.) In a way though, that still kind of fits with the tone of the story. Everyone in this story is flawed through and through. There are few characters, not even Dove Linkhorn whose story it essentially is, who you can genuinely root for, and yet at the same time, you do empathize with these madcap characters. So the flaws and purposelessness of the main characters is reflective of the book as a whole, but the writing alone makes it a real joy to read. It is more of a caricature of Depression-era Americana than an actual story with a plot, but it is so reckless and desperate and warmhearted (despite its bleakness) that it is still hard to put down."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Aargh I can't listen to this.

As Algren admitted, the book \"wasn't written until long after it had been walked . . . I found my way to the streets on the other side of the Southern Pacific station, where the big jukes were singing something called 'Walking the Wild Side of Life.' I've stayed pretty much on that side of the curb ever since.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the author's own words describe this classic work best: \"The book asks why lost people sometimes develop into greater human beings than those who have never been lost in their whole lives. Why men who have suffered at the hands of other men are the natural believers in humanity, while those whose part has been simply to acquire, to take all and give nothing, are the most contemptuous of mankind.\"", "asin": "0374525323", "rank": "121727", "city": "New Orleans", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41XLw%2BafRXL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
