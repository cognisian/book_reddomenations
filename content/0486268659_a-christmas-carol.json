That volume, A Christmas Carol, has long since become one of the most beloved stories in the English language. As much a part of the holiday season as holly, mistletoe, and evergreen wreaths, this perennial favorite continues to delight new readers and rekindle thoughts of charity and goodwill.\r\n\r\nWith its characters exhibiting many qualities \u2015 as well as failures \u2015 often ascribed to Dickens himself, the imaginative and entertaining tale relates Ebenezer Scrooge's eerie encounters with a series of spectral visitors. Journeying with them through Christmases past, present, and future, he is ultimately transformed from an arrogant, obstinate, and insensitive miser to a generous, warmhearted, and caring human being. \r\n\r\nWritten by one of England's greatest and most popular novelists, A Christmas Carol has come to epitomize the true meaning of Christmas.", "asin": "0486268659", "rank": "550", "city": "London", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51AIadKZ-6L.jpg", "country": "England", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
