I particularly enjoyed the twists and turns that left me totally surprised at the end!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A fan of Allan Furst's WWII thrillers, I was both delighted and skeptical to stumble upon Tom Gabbay\u2019s \"The Lisbon Crossing\" while wandering through the stacks at my local library. Furst sets the bar very high when it comes to WWII espionage novels.  As it turns out, Tom Gabbay is up to the challenge. While Allan Furst strikes me as the John Le Carre' of WWII fiction, Tom Gabbay writes with a lighter, wittier touch - a little Raymond Chandler, some Robert Ludlum, plus a dash of Julius Epstein (screenwriter of \"Casablanca\").Gabbay's plot is simple: in the summer of 1940, while the US remains a spectator and Nazi Germany sweeps through France and threatens England, Hollywood stunt man, Jack Teller, accompanies screen legend, Lili Sterne, to Lisbon to search for Sterne's childhood friend, Eva Lange. Apart from being the stunt double for Errol Flynn, whom Teller dislikes, Jack holds his own as an amateur detective and reluctant spy. Double-cross in Lisbon is as common as port wine, and it's up to Teller to figure out who is spying for whom.One intriguing plot line in \"The Lisbon Crossing\" involves Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor, and his American born wife, Wallis Simpson. Gabbay portrays Edward as a Nazi appeaser while Simpson is portrayed as a woman fond of playing musical beds. In general, writers try to have some historical basis for their portrayal of real, historical characters in fiction. Gabbay's portrayal of Edward and Wallis interested me enough to search the Internet for details. While Gabbay's plot line involving Prince Edward goes beyond what can be proven, Prince Edward's attitude toward Nazi Germany was of sufficient concern that Edward and Wallis were shipped off to the Bahamas and muzzled.As a former screenwriter, I recognize the influence of Hollywood scripts in Gabbay's writing, and that influence works well in \"The Lisbon Crossing\". Gabbay keeps the plot moving forward, the characters ready to surprise us, and the ending bittersweet and believable."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Great storyline and well told. Was an easy read that kept my attention throughout.I would highly recommend this book!"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I completely enjoyed the \"Berlin Conspiracy\" and \"Lisbon Crossing\", but just could not 'get into' the \"Tehran Conviction\".  I felt as if the story wasn't going anywhere, 'lacked excitement'  and wasn't even close in quality reading to the other books."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "IT IS WRITTEN IN THE DASCHELL HAMMIT/RAYMOND CHANDLER STYLE, TOUGH PRIVATE EYE, HOLLYWOOD STAR, MYSTERY AND MURDER.GOOD READ WITH REFERENCES TO LISBON AND THE SURROUNDING AREA.  GOING THERE THIS SUMMER ON A CRUISE AND ENJOYED THE INSIGHT ALONG WITH THE STORY"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Tom Gabbay's second novel \"The Lisbon Crossing\" is a slam-dunk winner.  Jack Teller surfaces again.  This time he is asked to accompany mega-movie star Lili Sterne to Portugal to help a childhood friend escape wartime Europe.  Of course, the simple rescue mission turns out to be anything but.  No one is who they appear to be and everything seems to be wrapped in some sort of conspiracy.What author Tom Gabbay does so well is tell an intriguingly complex plot in an uncomplicated manner.  The story moves crisply and tautly without extraneous tangents until a pretty good climax.  You don't lose track of who the multiple characters are or what's happening.  The characters' wry repartee is a plus.  Loved the way real historical figures (like the Duke and Duchess of Windsor) are woven into the storyline.  Ten pages from the end I still hadn't figured out the ending and that always pleases me.  Nothing worse than figuring out an espionage thriller halfway through a book.I enjoyed \"The Lisbon Crossing\" immensely and have nothing but praise for it.  I would recommend it to those who love spy novels."}]}, "authors": ["Tom Gabbay"], "isbn": "0061188441", "longitude": -9.1365061, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "The Lisbon Crossing", "word_cloud": "good enjoy story character immensely write plot seem amateurish first find sealer third way story keep engage ok great storyteller talent define character short succinct sentence write style earlier age match well set highly enjoyable provide interest historical viewpoint particularly enjoy twist turn leave totally surprised end fan thriller delight skeptical stumble wander stack local library set bar high come espionage novel turn challenge strike fiction write lighter wittier touch little dash screenwriter plot simple summer remain spectator sweep threatens stunt man accompany screen legend search childhood friend stunt double dislike hold amateur detective reluctant spy common port wine figure spy intriguing plot line involve wife portray appeaser portray woman fond play musical bed general writer try historical basis portrayal real historical character fiction portrayal interested enough search detail plot line involve go proven attitude sufficient concern ship former screenwriter recognize influence script write influence work well keep plot move forward character ready surprise end bittersweet believable story line well tell easy keep attention highly completely enjoy felt story go anywhere excitement even close quality reading second winner surface time ask accompany star help childhood friend escape course simple rescue mission turn anything appear everything seem wrapped sort author well tell intriguingly complex plot uncomplicated manner story move crisply tautly extraneous tangent pretty good climax lose track multiple character happen character wry repartee way real historical figure woven story line page end still figure end always please worse figuring espionage thriller halfway enjoy immensely nothing praise spy novel", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Mystery & Suspense", "Historical Fiction", "WWII"], "summary": "Summer 1940.
