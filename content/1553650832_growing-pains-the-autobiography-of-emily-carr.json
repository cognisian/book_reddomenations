Also here is the frustration she felt at the rejection of her art by Canadians, of the years of despair when she stopped painting. She had to earn a living, and did so by running a small apartment-house, and her painful years of land-ladying and more joyful times raising dogs for sale, claimed all her time and energy. Then, towards the end of her life, came unexpected vindication and triumph when the Group of Seven accepted her as one of them. Throughout, the book is informed with Carr\u2019s passionatate love of and connection with nature.\r\n\r\nCarr is a natural storyteller whose writing is vivid and vital, informed by wit, nostalgic charm, an artist\u2019s eye for description, a deep feeling for creatures and the foibles of humanity--all the things that made her previous books Klee Wyck and Book of Small so popular and critically acclaimed.\r\n", "asin": "1553650832", "rank": "987690", "city": "Vancouver", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41fWcROuP9L.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
