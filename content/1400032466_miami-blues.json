That there is the power of cinema.  It's still an awesome book even rereading it and knowing full well what's going to happen. It is strikingly different in tone and affect from Willeford's earlier pulp works so much so that you wonder how that could be.What's really remarkable about Miami Blues and its sequels (and no I haven't read the secret unpublished manuscript of the original dark nasty sequel) is how could Willeford really became at storytelling.  Each page and even each paragraph tells a whole story.  There are oddities that he throws in seemingly effortlessly like the Hare Krishna dying of a broken finger or the casual mentions of incest. And then there are these amazing characters like the dimwitted prostitute who wakes up each day as wide-eyed and innocent as the day she was born.  Or the psychopathic killer who decides to become her platonic husband.  Or the homicide detective who is forever losing his chompers (dentures) and lives in a fleabag hotel because he sends every other paycheck for alimony.The actual plot plays second fiddle to all these classic scenes like the ex-con and the cop having dinner together or Junior going to \"work\" at the mall.  Some of what takes place is the gallows humor of the police station but it's do funny you almost forget the one-man crime wave Junior is.An absolutely breathtaking work."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The book that started it all."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Fun, quick read for a rainy day"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Charles Willeford is an underrated crime writer from the 1950s through the 1980s. This book was something of a breakthrough novel for him. With good reason. The book is smoothly written, well plotted and has some wonderful touches of absurdist humor. Like Elmore Leonard, Willeford's best characters are the bad guys and the bad guy in this book is really something. I would highly recommend this book to any fan of modern crime fiction. Good book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I'm from Florida.  Some people would think he copies Dave Barry.  Maybe but we just want to share the Zika, alligator bites, and rednecks with everyone else."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Hoke Moseley is old school, hard-boiled and hard-wired to distrust change but his Miami world of the late 80's is changing fast.'It used to be a lot different when Hoke was still married. Four or five couples would get together for a barbecue and some beer. Then, after they ate, the women would all sit in the living room and talk about how difficult their deliveries had been, and the men would sit in the kitchen and play poker ... That had been real Florida living, but now all the white families were moving away. There were six different detectives Hoke had known who had left Miami in the last year alone.Hoke looked out at the river, never the same river. He wanted another shot of Early Times, but not at these prices. Hoke left the bar and got his car from the parking ramp... the smell of vomit on the back seat was almost overpowering. When he got to the Eldorado Hotel, he'd get one of the Marielitos who lived there to clean it out.'The 'Marielitos' embody all that has gone wrong in Hoke's mid-life American Nightmare.'Our wimpy ex-President, Jimmy Carter, opened his arms to 125,000 Cubans back in 1980... but Castro also opened his prisons and insane asylums and sent along another 25,000 hardcore criminals, gays and maniacs. They sailed from Mariel, in Cuba, so they call them Marielitos.'Hoke's detective badge and gun are the bulwark against the inevitable fall of civilization as he knows it, his own personal hard headed power amplified by his status as a Miami Homicide Detective. When he falls, beaten to a pulp, badge and gun stolen, it isn't at the hands of a 'Marielito' but to the very white, very American Freddy Frenger Junior - the grotesquely muscled psychopath recently released from San Quentin, intent on pillaging his way to as much cash and high living as he could manage before he would be incarcerated again.In his own way, Junior Frenger sustains his own American Dream just as Hoke's has become tattered and obsolete. Junior is ambitious and will do whatever it takes to reach his goals. He believes that if he really, really, really wants something, all he has to do is go and take it - usually by breaking bones, smashing heads or pumping bullets into a human obstacle.Not that Hoke is in any way a pacifist or shy of applying muscle when he deems fit, but Hoke's code of honor, such as it is, is predicated on his sense of selfless service - he doesn't take bribes, he pays his tab at Irish Mike's bar (reluctantly, and only when Mike demands it), and is loyal to his colleagues, even though he avoids their company.The concept of a hard-bitten, weary cop isn't new, and wasn't new when Willeford created Hoke Moseley, but Moseley stands out as a singular example of the genre. A willing product of his casually racist, misogynistic, macho culture, and honed in the crucible of police dept siege mentality, Hoke Moseley exists on the margins where the sun rising on civil society tomorrow can't be assumed, where the threat of malicious injury or death is always real, and where, even if you fear 'others' as a collective abstract threat, you killer may very well look just like you.'Hoke went to the desk and poured an overflowing jigger of Early Times into his tooth glass. Too much. He poured part of it back into the bottle. His hands shook a little, and he spilled part of his drink. He could hear his heart beat. The more he thought of Mendez, the more afraid he was. This was not paranoia. When a man has beaten you badly and you know that he can do it again, a wholesome fear is a sign of intelligence.'"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Note sure I appreciate a vicious psychopath carrying the name Freddy, but he does and, as the girl he never got around to killing notes \"He does have his good points.\" Book is an interesting time warp, seeing Miami in the 80s with reference on one page to Woolworths, Burdines, and Eckerd Drugs which no longer grace the Florida retail scene, constant smoking anywhere and everywhere by most of the characters, police officers needing to borrow a phone on scene to report in, etc. The story is interesting, if unusual. Short and not so sweet with a most unusual \"hero\", a cop living in a broken down flophouse style hotel, deeply in debt due to a divorce and unable to make much headway as the daughters need braces, and he needing to get his dentures replaced,etc. (Note those dentures play an interesting role in the narrative.) Not sure why the author needed to keep mentioning prices unless it was to tie it to the time period. Still, one of my more interesting reads lately."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "It's written in French.I assumed it was in English."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Charles Willeford is one of the very best crime writers out there -- equal to Elmore Leonard (IMHO); a shade better than George V.

Unfortunately, he passed away before anymore could be written--a great loss since Moseley was an eminently likable, fallible detective in these books leavened by Willeford's dark brand of humor. Start with this, read the next three and then go back to some of his earlier classics.
