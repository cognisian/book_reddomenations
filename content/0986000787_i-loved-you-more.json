Dipping back and forth in time, the novel includes New York's '80s, his Idaho youth, and a few intimate-epic trips. Having recently read Spanbauer's novel <i>Now Is The Hour</i>, I got a clear 'roman a clef' sense, from his references to childhood, and other aspects. The repetition of phrases and foretelling of pivotal events to come, whether poetic or annoying, depending on your taste, returned and returned.The section of Ben's HIV illness is moving, painful, and truthful. I felt many scenes were well dramatized; the trippy moments, the conversations and settings. I empathized for his breakup with Ruth, and despite Ben being gay, how he felt trapped in a marriage of a sort. We're shown the inevitability of Ruth's connection with Hank. Yet I never truly understood why Hank was so fascinating. The near-Kerouac/Cassidy man-love is understandable. But without so much as a sentence or paragraph from Hank's book, why is he so alluring, other than being a handsome man who is a close -then distant- friend?Still, evocative and amusing, touching in many parts, I look forward to reading more of the author's books."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Spanbauer delivers once again - a powerful journey into love and intimacy over the arc of time.  I loved this book and his ability to transport me viscerally into the broad spectrum of the human experience."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Tom Spanbauer is a fantastic novelist. I've read all five of his books. With the first, Faraway Places, he is 'finding his feet', it's a very good book, but it\u2019s with the second, The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon, where Spanbauer fully demonstrates he is a master of words, truly establishing a style for strong, epic narrative. With this second novel Tom develops a kind of grand guignol flourish to his stories and wonderful characters within an all-encompassing grand epic. The gg flourish helps with the readability factor, making it literally fantastic fiction. This gg factor is at its peak with the Moon Lover, and then employed to varying degrees with the next two epics (each again being lovely books). Note, the below contains some spoilers, though I don\u2019t think they are huge ones . . .I Loved You More is an outstanding work of fiction on people, modern love, relationships (across hetero and homo \u2018borders\u2019), the passing of time, Aids, mental health and treatment. This is a book I cannot speak too highly of. It is a perfect book. It is a classic. I worry my review won\u2019t do the book justice as it is limited to my ability. With I Loved You More Tom finally abandons the almost-grand guignol style of Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon, still retaining the passionate prose of a gripping read. In this statement is part of what makes I Loved You More a great book: that it manages to be eminently readable and at the same time totally grounded in reality, addressing serious issues of commitment, honesty to oneself and honesty as a writer, and emotional honesty in relationships which could be construed as being based on lies (ie a homo with a hetero) (don\u2019t you love the English language).I Loved You More brings in many themes and characters with their own wonderful stories. The book is mainly about a triangular relationship between Ben, and Hank his best friend, and a third character Ruth. As is normal with Tom\u2019s books I find myself unable to stop reading as the main character goes from one world to the next, meeting new people, going to new places. A hundred pages go by, a decade rolls on, more characters come and go, and in this way a real story builds up about how Ben is struggling in America, to gain some kind of self worth and confidence, getting on with life, his writing, dealing with Aids and mental health problems. Throughout, the relationship between Ben and Hank glows in the dark. It sounds potentially corny, this \u2018Eternal Flame\u2019 of a relationship, but that\u2019s what Tom succeeds in portraying with Ben and Hank. [To be clear they are just buddies.] It must be one of the best accounts of a close friendship I have ever read, it\u2019s convincing, it\u2019s moving, it\u2019s of itself unique (ie, it has it\u2019s own life).Ruth\u2019s character is also full colour (perhaps more so in its warts and all way). Where Ben and Hank\u2019s friendship is a beacon of love on a pedestal, the love between Ben and Ruth, nevertheless true, is certainly different. In fact it stands in sharp comparison, as fractured, having its demise within its origins. Ben appreciates Ruth for her love and support during the darkest period of his illness, but he is also brutally honest of her faults. In contrast, however, it seems Ruth\u2019s love for Ben is a demanding love. The way Spanbauer describes this is wise in its unjudgemental stance, he leaves it to the reader to fathom certain issues rather than making them explicit. Though Spanbauer is usually explicit, there are some interesting points which go by unmentioned despite his honesty. For instance as Ben is suffering from a crippling illness and accompanying mental and physical conditions, fear of going out, depression, sleeplessness, exhaustion etc; Ruth thrives. Not explicitly stated, it\u2019s insinuated that Ben takes this unnoticed wallflower, Ruth, and encourages her to blossom \u2013 gone is her fringe, her hair grows lush and long, she loses weight, she develops her confidence, her sense of self, her writing and teaching \u2013 and she says to him that he will never be able to repay her for the help she has given him! In laying these ideas quietly, is Spanbauer playing an upper hand here? Pretending to be humble, wanting to be the saint, or does he truly not realise what he gave to Ruth in the relationship? This could be seen as dark stuff: it\u2019s as though Ruth, the flower, blooms, as Ben\u2019s life turns to compost. It\u2019s a harsh statement to put into words \u2013 the dynamic of Ruth\u2019s relationship (especially if some of the book\u2019s content is auto-biographical?) \u2013 does Ruth deliberately seek out weak men in order to dominate and flourish? Continuing the story, old habits die hard, on first sight, Ruth falls immediately for Hank, it must be his glass eye . . .The book\u2019s comparisons of different love is part of the books unveiling of the mysteries of love, its multifarious guises. There is a kind of balance between Ben and Ruth: where Ben doesn\u2019t reciprocate the same love for Ruth, she doesn\u2019t reciprocate honesty in the same way. This is the messiness of love in all its unglory. With Ben and Hanks friendship, what is shown is the glory of love when there are no such demands put on it and where the frontiers are clearer. Love here is more pure, a source of strength, seemingly more simple, perhaps rarer. Then there are many other stories of love within the book drawn through other characters.These complexities make it difficult to review Spanbauer properly as there is so much included in his writing. The main thing is that Spanbauer is a loving, compassionate author. He takes characters who are side-lined, a bit beat up, secondary to other people and builds a story around that character (who he relates to, the central characters are always similarly from the West, gay, and with similar family backgrounds). Hence he is \u2018un-marginalising\u2019 the antihero, \u2018centralising\u2019 the geek. This isn\u2019t new of course. Hubert Selby Junior was a master at this in Last Exit. But the way Spanbauer does it is deftly elegant: to write the antihero into a kind of heroic text. Watch how the epic builds up around his characters: you love them, identify with them and desperately want them to be happy. And the \u2018other\u2019 people, those who are normally at the epicentre (straights etc) are shown to have their problems as well. This isn\u2019t anti-straight writing. But it is writing that sets past bent records straight (or at least a bit more straight). Everybody has problems, it is human to suffer, and a gay person isn\u2019t by definition a secondary character. Spanbauer\u2019s writing thus becomes suitably political in unmarginalising the marginised \u2013 doing it so beautifully, so entertainingly is thick icing.As societal imbalances are being redressed in this way, all the other characters reveal their stories as well, as mentioned, a lot of them are \u2018beat up\u2019 stories. I suppose, some are tragic. Tragedy is ultimately avoided in the redemptive pursuit of coming to terms with seeking place, confidence, self worth and purpose and what it means to be human, that a negative can be a positive, such as Aids, when it is accepted as a general aspect of being human, experiencing life within the full spectrum of what life means, pain is part of human experience. [This acceptance of Aids comes when Aids is no longer the Death Toll faced with ignorance as it was in the Eighties.]. Of course there are happy moments in between, the light glinting off the porcelain, Ida\u2019s bed (from the Ida of Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon). A lot of meaningful eye to eye contact. Love in full bloom. Other issues also enter about feminism, racism and the Sioux, poverty etc. The descriptions of Ben\u2019s mental health tied up with Aids, how it makes him feel isolated from the outer world, how it affects his relationship with Ruth (how she even believes he is making a large bit of it up!), and what treatments are available in Oregon is described stunningly with a lot of small detail in between.The truly wonderful thing is Spanbauer\u2019s skill at dealing with all these issues in an entertaining read (unlike my crap review); with a funny, humane and beautiful style of writing. I\u2019ve tried to avoid revealing the specific story here, this is the kind of review that makes much more sense after having read the book. My main purpose is to nod my head to a very powerful writer. One who should be getting much more attention.[While writing this it reminded me of another classic of gay literature, Modern Love by Paul Magrs.]\"I\u2019ve never really thought I\u2019d say thank god I got AIDS or that it was a blessing I got AIDS. I actually end up saying it in this book. It was. It\u2019s helped me have a new awareness about all this **** that I went through. It\u2019s really profound. For the longest time I felt selected out and put upon and why me. Now I just understand that I\u2019m just a part of human suffering.\" ~Tom Spanbauer"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book has become my favorite. Tom Spanbaur's writing is poetic and beautiful."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I wanted to like this book as the premise sounded interesting. Set in the 80s and 90s, it started off well enough, from the beginning Ben admits that he's impotent and reminds you every chance he gets, then for much of the middle the narrative takes you on an aimless cross country road trip with Ben and Hank where nothing physical happens. Ever. It's one long period where Ben whines over not getting what he wants from Hank, a physical relationship, while he obsessively studies every unimportant nuance of his straight friend. I guess we're lucky since this is all information the reader is going to get about Hank, as we never get into his head and truly understand him.The author repeats details and phrases throughout the book over and over, as if he's saying to the reader, \"remember this in case you didn't catch it the first time,\" which is insulting and is a waste of time and print. The last quarter of the book picks up a bit as Ben struggles with HIV while his friend Ruth plays caretaker, and who similarly harbors unrequited crush on Ben. The triangle closes when Ruth meets Hank and they run off and leave  Ben behind. The story resolves into nothing more than a few hundred pages of sour grapes."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a wonderful book, highly recommend it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I didn't see the \"plot twist\" until I was on pg. 412ARGHHHIt's so beautiful, it hurts."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This is not his best book but worth the read.
