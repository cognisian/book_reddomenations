Ms. Wilentz has done a masterful job."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Wilentz's analysis of what has gone wrong (and quite often right) in Haiti relief efforts reminds me of the evolution of Oxfam. Oxfam started after World War II with the simple goal of providing money to recovering European communities. Then it made a major leap to working together with local communities to determine their own needs and how to satisfy them. In its most recent change, another major evolution (as I understand it), Oxfam recognizes that poor and marginalized communities cannot improve themselves without rectifying the power imbalance in the world. I think Wilentz is asking for just such an evolution among people who care about Haiti. But many of the stories in the book reinforce common impressions about Haiti (and perhaps Wilentz herself can be credited with launching such conversations). I also found the book a bit repetitious and indulging a bit too often into self-reflection, although Wilentz, as a masterful writer, used those traits to build her arguments. We are left with the urge to find out what Haitians want and to ask whether we can productively ask for anything different."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Like most of the Western World there is a mentality of \u2018out of sight out of mind.\u2019 Wilentz makes Haiti very much insight, in mind. It shares the personal accounts of Haitian culture, missionary workers, Doctors without Boarders, and the reporter who brings it all to us. It made Haiti hit home by pulling on the heartstrings of the innocent Haitian children victims to their surroundings. It merged the gap with the fables we tell kids to teach them a lesson and keep them safe; only instead of Snow White they had werewolves and voodoo. It made me respect those that give their life for a cause with solutions so far out of reach\u2014yet they jump in. Great read with a blend of culture and humanity."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere and will continue to be so forever.  It combines the deepest ignorance and the deepest corruption of any country outside Africa.  This does not mean that well meaning white people should not try to help.  But be prepared to accomplish nothing and to be criticized by people like Amy Wilentz.  Haitians are no more capable of self-rule than a cat is capable of flying an airplane."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very well written, based on personal experience, knowledgeable author.

Farewell, Fred Voodoo is a journey into the depths of the human soul as well as a vivid portrayal of the nation\u2019s extraordinary people and their uncanny resilience. Haiti has found in Amy Wilentz an author of astonishing wit, sympathy, and eloquence.\r\n\r\n\u201cFarewell, Fred Voodoo showcases all [Wilentz\u2019s] formidable gifts as a reporter: her love of, and intimate familiarity with, Haiti; her sense of historical perspective; and her eye for the revealing detail. Like Joan Didion and V. S. Naipaul, she has an ability not only to provide a visceral, physical feel for a place, but also to communicate an existential sense of what it\u2019s like to be there as a journalist with a very specific and sometimes highly subjective relationship with her subject.\u201d Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times\r\n", "asin": "1451644078", "rank": "675906", "city": "Haiti", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lLS4hrxKL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
