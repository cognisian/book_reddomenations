The professor swears it is a Vermeer\u2014but why has he hidden this important work for so long? The reasons unfold in a series of events that trace the ownership of the painting back to World War II and Amsterdam, and still further back to the moment of the work's inspiration. As the painting moves through each owner's hands, what was long hidden quietly surfaces, illuminating poignant moments in multiple lives. Susan Vreeland's characters remind us, through their love of this mysterious painting, how beauty transforms and why we reach for it, what lasts and what in our lives is singular and unforgettable.", "asin": "014029628X", "rank": "64125", "city": "Amsterdam", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41wNlJyDtzL.jpg", "country": "The Netherlands", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
