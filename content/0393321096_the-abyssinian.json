A fictional story about XVIIth/XVIIIth century Abyssinia (today's Ethopia) based on the memoirs of the French doctor Charles Poncet, one of very rare Europeans (or westerners) to enter the country that did not want the foreingers on its soil. His testimony describes Ethiopia and Gondar, its capital city of these times in a very detailed way.

The first half of the book is quite good - detailing the travels of an embassy from Louis IV to the Negus (emperor) of Abyssinia in 1699. The novelist makes good use of the intrigues and mistrust among the various Catholic and other Western factions. The hero is a young herbalist whose medical knowledge gives him near miraculous powers, and provides several easy escapes from intricate plot devices. But these sections do impart a good sense of what it might be like to travel in these then unknown parts of the world, down the Nile, through Egypt and the Sudan, and ultimately to Ethiopia. (A good map would have been handy for this, as the areas involved are not well-known, even today.) But, about half way through, the descriptions and background can't hide the predictability of the plot, and the Candidean romantic subplot detracts from the overall effect."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This is a tale of the adventures and travails of a French doctor living in Egypt during the reign of Louis XIV (i.e. the seventeenth century).  One could describe this novel as an attempt to mix the best of Patrick O'Brian, William Thackeray, and Maurice Druon, although this work falls far short of the lofty heights of literature achieved by this triumverate.  This is a translation of a work originally written in French that won the author the prestigious Prix Goncourt award for Best First Novel.  Must have been a lean year.  The main character, Jean-Baptiste Poncet, is a self-taught doctor living in Cairo.  He is very much the modern (20/21st century) man, and holds few of the ideals and prejudices of his 17th century contemporaries.  The story centers on a journey that Poncet and several companions take through Egypt into the wilds of Abyssinia nominally to bring catholicism to the natives and expand the realm of both Louis XIV and the Catholic Church.  This is a good effort at historical fiction by Rufin, but ultimately it falls short of the likes of Druon, and probably not of enduring value.  The characters are one dimensional and cliched (the scheming priests, the ministerial sycophant, the greedy Arab merchant, etc.).  The author never succeeds in painting a picture of the land, of the people, or of the culture of the time.  I never felt that I was immersed in 17th century Egypt, and I learned almost no history or culture.  The plot is entirely predictable, and the love affair tedious and common.  There are a few flashes of greatness in this novel, and I generously rated this book at four stars (3.5 stars is probably fair) because of the obvious thoughtful effort put in by the author, but there are just too many fatal weaknesses to label this a great novel.  Fundamentally, this book just doesn't have the `feel' of a great work of historical fiction.  This is a decent, but not outstanding, novel.  I look forward to reading more from Mr. Rufin as he refines his craft."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "It's an exciting novel of merit. Jean-Christophe Rufin's book \"The Abyssinian\" combines intrigue, drama, adventure, romance, and more intrigue worthy of the time spent reading it.Set in 17th-century Cairo during the reign of Louis XIV, Jean-Baptiste Poncet, is the young protagonist, a French doctor who, alas, is practicing without a license in Egypt. Through his connections with the French consul, he is dispatched on a diplomatic mission to the King Negus, of Abyssinia to try to open up diplomatic opportunities. It is a dangerous mission, as Christians are not welcomed following, some 50 years prior, the expulsion of the Jesuits from the area. And during the course of the book, Poncet has to confront many personal obstacles, both physically and emotionally.A \"period piece\" of the first water, \"The Abyssinian\" combines the typical melodrama of such a tine in literature-the daring adventures, the daring romances, the daring intrigues. Rufin seems to have captured well these characteristics as he's made a novel that is compelling to read, one that, despite the obvious melodrama, captures the reader's interest tout suite with lots of wit, creativity, and cleverness.To call this book \"larger than life\" is perhaps an understatement but it's what one would expect if it were written by 18th or 19th century novelists! I look for further Rufin works of fiction! (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I really enjoyed this book and its sequel.  They are both \"simply\" adventure stories and are not on a par with other timeless literature or history/political analysis, but they took me to a place and time about which I know only a little and that I would otherwise never be able to see.  The characters are interesting if not so developed as, say, Holden Caulfield or any of Mary Renault's.That being said, I was sad when the adventure was over and the events, settings, and characters stayed with me for months.  I hope there will be a third book.  I haven't had this much fun for quite a while."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The reviews of this book were glowing, but I found the book to be good but not great.
