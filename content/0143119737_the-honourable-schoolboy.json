So many dilemmas, so much conflicting emotions, collateral sacrifice packed into a few pages. Yes there were parts where I wish the pace was picked up a bit, for example, the introspection chapter of Jerry Westerby by the Mekong river.

Given the charge of the gravely compromised Circus, George Smiley embarks on a campaign to uncover what Moscow Centre most wants to hide. When the trail goes cold at a Hong Kong gold seam, Smiley dispatches Gerald Westerby to shake the money tree. A part-time operative with cover as a philandering journalist, Westerby insinuates himself into a war-torn world where allegiances\u2014and lives\u2014are bought and sold.\r\n\r\nBrilliantly plotted and morally complex, The Honourable Schoolboy is the second instalment of John le Carr\u00e9's renowned Karla trilogy and a riveting portrayal of postcolonial espionage.\r\n \r\n\u201cNot a page of this book is without intelligence and grace.\u201d The New York Times\r\n", "asin": "0143119737", "rank": "31759", "city": "Bangkok", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51iStuTnyeL.jpg", "country": "Thailand", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
