I love all the familiar characters -- Brer Fox, Troy, etc.  And they aren't in this.  But Marsh did write a very good book.  If it had been a different character, I may have given it 5 stars, but I just missed the regulars and the usual English setting.  It is much more adventure/derring-do than the slower paced Marsh books.  And as said before, very well written."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It had a very surprise ending.

Ngaio Marsh developed her character Inspector Allyen in the 1930 - so this is a much later book in the series.  I've read several in the series and found it odd to find words such as \"groovy\".One annoying factor is that when the book was transcribed to the electronic version, many, many spelling errors were made.  It is very annoying and a distraction.  Words ending in \"ing\" are typed \"ink\".  The word curb is misspelled as Kerb.  It's a shame that such a great work (series) is marred like this.Despite not being set or written earlier in time, I really enjoyed the plot and characters.  A very British mystery.  If you like Inspector Allyen, read this book and if you're starting the series, you can easily begin with this one."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "When in Rome by Ngiao Marsh is another wonderful gem by this great author.  Her writing is brilliant, subtle, and witty. Roderick Alleyn is one of my favorite classic Inspectors from Scotland Yard."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Msg.
