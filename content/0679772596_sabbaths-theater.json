Alas, I shouldn\u2019t have done so now. Even Roth cannot make the sex-drenched misanthropic puppeteer Mickey Sabbath come to life. He means his title character to be transgressive; he is merely unimaginatively obsessive. Save the brilliant section where Sabbath visits the Jersey shore of his childhood, and the family memories scattered throughout, there is little to redeem the novel\u2019s self-indulgent writing. Was I shocked? No, merely bored."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I have found that people who love this book believe that people who hate this book do so because they fail to appreciate unlikable characters.  Mickey Sabbath, the main character of this work, is certainly unlikable.  His actions are consistently depraved and mean-spirited - his sexual exploits (which are described at an unnecessary length) are least among the terrible things Sabbath does or says.  I don't mind unlikable characters. I don't hate this book because of Sabbath.  I hate this book because of Philip Roth.I found this book to be written poorly.  It might have worked as a novella, but at 450 pages in paperback, it drags on too long, focusing too much time on describing sexual conquests that provide no insight into characters and only serves to break the flow of the book.  The women in this book are poorly developed.  They have no value if they are not sexual beings. For a character who seems to base his life around three things: the death or disappearance of loved ones; sex; and attempting to manipulate people, the women with whom the Sabbath is intimately involved (he has an ex wife and a wife, along with a permanent lover), none of the women are developed beyond a sketch.Additionally, the racist rantings of Sabbath go without critique and nothing more than a tepid one-word challenge.  It begins to feel less like a purposeful attempt at making an unlikable character and more like an excuse to use a characters as a vehicle to spout one's own unpopular opinions.I have friends who loved this book.  I have friends who hated it.  I'm firmly in the second camp."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The (anti-) hero, Morris 'Mickey' Sabbath, is an 'Evangelist of Fornication'. The core of seduction is persistence - that sums up his operational paradigm. He is also deeply into pessimism. Part 1 of this novel is titled 'There's nothing that keeps its promise'. A typical addict view, right? But then, the title is wrong, the book is better than its own opening. Or does that mean it is right?This novel starts by seeming pointless, and by being a bit repulsive. But don't give up too quickly, things develop and grow depth, though they tend to stay repulsive. Don't come here with tasteful pretensions or expectations. Certainly don't put any bet on Mickey's good character.Games and dreams of a dirty old man. Well, let's say 'elderly'. At 64, he has reached the end of his tether. He has no life and no future. His first wife disappeared, his second wife kicks him out, his soul- and playmate has died of cancer, his reputation in his New England town is ruined by a scandal, his arthritic hands make him unable to work in his profession as a puppeteer, he has no money. What now? Even suicide is elusive.What we have now is the past. The past is complex and messy enough to give Roth food for masterly prose. The disappearance of wife 1, an actress, adds a sort of mystery element to the tale. Did she run and hide? Was violence involved? Did he kill her, as he sometimes enjoys boasting?Sabbath walks NYC streets, a Jersey beach, a New England cemetery with a suicidal mind set. His doomsday is  a stylish salute to  Bloomsday. Though it may seem, in bits, like a copy, if not a parody, I would go so far as to say that Sabbath, in his mental state, has more reason and plausibility to think and observe in that manner than Bloom ever had. Sabbath is also a more complex person, with his outrageous misbehavior. I began to enjoy him, after a few hundred pages. Just wait for the Rosa episode, and then the Michelle climax!The past also has the story of Mickey 's brother, who died in the Pacific War. There is a lot of past in Mickey. He is a sort of senior Portnoy. In a way I like him better than Portnoy."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "This is going to be short and sweet. After admiring most of Roth's novels, and learning that he himself picked Portnoy's Complaint and Sabbath's Theater (try reading that one to its conclusion), two of the most depraved and misogynistic novels in American literature, as his best ones, Roth will never be a contender for the Nobel Prize. Having said that, he is still my favorite American writer."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The main character is so loathsome that I kept trying to stop reading but I couldn't because it so well written. Hard to recommend because its so dark."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Very disappointed.  I've enjoyed Roth's work in the past and saw that this book was generally praised.  As I was reading, I began skimming pages, and the by the time I got to the latter stages, I abandoned the text entirely.  Roth's sentences flow easily, and yet, I became so bored with the mis-adventures of Mickey Sabbath that I was rooting for him to die.  What a slog.  I couldn't find a single character that was believable, appealing (even a villain), or able to hold my interest.  Elements of the premise had potential (the puppeteer metaphor).  It's not required that realism be an requirement for fiction, but few of the circumstances detailed in the novel seemed at all believable.  I hope I have better luck with a different Roth novel."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Philip Roth not at his best, but still Philip Roth."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Fabulous Roth!

But to be honest,- of course it depends on what you are used to -, every now and then, reading Sabbath's Theatre, I really had to swallow (my apologies for the too obvious pun).In a superficial reading of the book you see main character Mickey Sabbath, a 64-year-old former puppeteer on the way down, just as a sex addict, as a pervert: he can't get enough of his mistress, the 10-year younger nymphomaniac Drenka, of Croatian descent, and even apart from that, he dreams permanently of trios, he has phone sex with young girls, he gets a kick touching the underwear of the daughter of his best friend, and so on. For Mickey, it's all very innocent and his natural way of life; and through the intense and indeed sometimes very explicit way of describing by Roth, that does sound rather plausible (p 245: For a pure sense of being tumultuously alive, you can\u2019t beat the nasty side of existence).Throughout the book, we see that there\u2019s a lot more to this natural, \u201camoral\u201d state of mind of Sabbath. He is unbalanced by the death of his mistress, and then we discover that he has become traumatized by the early death of his brother Morty, the death of his mother (with whom he still talks permanently), and by the sudden disappearance of his first wife Nicky. Gradually you get to see that the sex addiction of Sabbath is essentialy an intense endeavour to live, derived from the existential feeling of lack and loss, and permanently fired by a flight for death. Roth succesfully turns the pervert that he describes at first, into a touching, pitiful older man who notes that he is approaching the end and realizes he\u2019s a failure (but nevertheless gives his orgiastic instinct free rein).During the reading of the book I regularly was reminded of Leopold Bloom, the also Jewish main character of James Joyce in Ulysses: just as Sabbath Bloom is portrayed by Joyce as a man of small proportion, but eventually more as an Elckerlyc , representative of men in general. Also in this book there are many implicit and explicit winkings at Ulysses: shortly before halfway Roth even presents us a quick overview of the writing styles of Ulysses, as a brilliant homage to Joyce; and who can not link the masturbation scene of Sabbath's wife at the end of the book, with Penelopes (Bloom\u2019s wife) monologue interieur at the end of Ulysses?So, also from a literary point of view, this book must not be underestimated, and then I don\u2019t even mention the rousing rhetorical delights Sabbath regularly gives, the countless hilarious scenes and the constatation that despite the sometimes embarrassing descriptions you can\u2019t really put down this book. The picaresque novel (in the tradition of Apuleius, Rabelais and numberous others)is not really my favorite genre, but in this genre this book is a XXth Century masterpiece!"}]}, "authors": ["Philip
