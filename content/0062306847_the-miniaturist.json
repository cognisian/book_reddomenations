It took me a little while to get into the rhythm of the story, mostly due to the prologue, which I found to be unnecessary & confusing.  But after wading through the prologue and 1st chapter, the characters were properly introduced and the story started to flow.  I enjoy historical fiction and the description of life in Amsterdam during the late 1600's  was fascinating.  Despite struggling at the beginning of this book, the rest of the story was so good that I would not hesitate to recommend it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Loved it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This will be a great book for discussion at my Queen Bees' book club. The Miniaturist is really well written and is truly a window into the daily life and struggles of a 15th century Dutch merchant and his family. Nella the protagonist peers into her miniature doll house catching glimpses of her future; on a parallel track, the  reader is drawn into the novel for an exploration of the deepest aspects of human nature - pride, anger, sloth, envy, greed, lust and ultimately love.  The story is a timeless mirror of ourselves that is quite relevant today."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I found the historical aspects of the book interesting."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Got through it.

But her new home, while splendorous, is not welcoming. Johannes is kind yet distant, always locked in his study or at his warehouse office\u2014leaving Nella alone with his sister, the sharp-tongued and forbidding Marin.\r\n\r\nBut Nella\u2019s world changes when Johannes presents her with an extraordinary wedding gift: a cabinet-sized replica of their home. To furnish her gift, Nella engages the services of a miniaturist\u2014an elusive and enigmatic artist whose tiny creations mirror their real-life counterparts in eerie and unexpected ways . . .\r\n\r\nJohannes\u2019 gift helps Nella to pierce the closed world of the Brandt household. But as she uncovers its unusual secrets, she begins to understand\u2014and fear\u2014the escalating dangers that await them all. In this repressively pious society where gold is worshipped second only to God, to be different is a threat to the moral fabric of society, and not even a man as rich as Johannes is safe. Only one person seems to see the fate that awaits them. Is the miniaturist the key to their salvation . . . or the architect of their destruction?\r\n\r\nEnchanting, beautiful, and exquisitely suspenseful, The Miniaturist is a magnificent story of love and obsession, betrayal and retribution, appearance and truth.", "asin": "0062306847", "rank": "31257", "city": "Amsterdam", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512eQCl4GwL.jpg", "country": "The Netherlands", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
