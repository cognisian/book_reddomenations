Do Not Say We Have NothingThis book is about life in contemporary China under the rule of Chairman Mao.  It gives a frightening picture of living under an unenlightened dictatorship, and recalls George Orwell\u2019s 1984, with its thought police, its constantly booming loudspeakers and government espionage methods cramping any suggestion of individualism.  But this novel is far from being a fantasy but a living nightmare in which individuals and government officials are named and presumably exposed.  It perpetually asks the implied question, \u2018What would you, the reader, do?\u2019  Those who seem to suffer the most are young professionals, since the book deals constantly with Chinese artists, especially musicians, whose work being non-verbal is therefore especially subject to scrutiny.I found the book to be over-long, made up of various confessions, without giving the reader a pole for sympathy.  It begins in Vancouver with Ma-li, occasionally transliterated as Mary, who is seeking her lost father, Ba Lute, but who is almost immediately introduced to a new arrival, Ai-ming,  a few years her senior, who is terrified in the open environment of the West.  She is constantly cold and afraid to go out.  The reader is just getting invoved with this relationship when the author switches to her \u2018real\u2019 subject - life in contemporary China, from the sudden disappearance of dissenters, to closed doors to all those suspected of \u2018Rightism.\u2019We meet scores of characters, many of whom appear to be quiet anti-revolutionists even as they are chanting \u2018Long live Chairman Mao, the Great  Helmsman,\u2019 and we are told about their inner lives, given retrospects within retrospects, for the dead past is their only means of survival.  We forget about Ma-li and Ai-ming for nearly 100 pages to learn about the ambitions and inevitable failures of the composer, Sparrow, who has been taught that \u2018desire, or something so small as love, was always subservient to revolution,\u2019 but \u2018the truth Sparrow felt led to another life entirely.  He knew or feared they could not be reconciled.\u2019This is an ambitious and heartfelt book, but this reader needed masses of notes to keep track of who was who - and was not as subject to tears as most of her characters."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The book is beautifully written, it's hard to put it down.

I speak and read Chinese and I was predisposed to like this book but after awhile I grew weary of it.  It is excessively long, the cast of characters is not easy to keep straight, and the leaps from the present to the past and back to the present are confusing.  Also, all the wordy references/allusions to music really added very little of substance to the book and I found myself skimming over them.  The tale just doesn't advance with any sense of purpose.
