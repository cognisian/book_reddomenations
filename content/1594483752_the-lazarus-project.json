Christ and went on to live in Marseilles. Hemon is an avowed atheist who cleverly weaves various acts of resurrection into this kaleidoscopic novel about alter ego (?) Brik, a Bosnian refugee from Sarajevo and struggling writer in Chicago, researching the death by police bullets there in 1908 of Lazarus Averbuch (LA), a young Jewish immigrant from the Ukraine, and its cover-up.About 100 years later, Brik, whose granddad arrived from the Ukraine in Bosnia with his parents aged 8, secures a grant and decides to find out more about LA in Eastern Europe, but not alone. He talks fellow exile and Sarajevo schoolmate Rora into joining him. Rora is a scion of an old, influential family, a story-teller, wisecracker, Muslim, coffee addict and compulsive  photographer. And a chancer who thrived during the siege of Sarajevo, the start of which Brik missed by weeks because of a short visit to Chicago. Rora is also Hemon\u2019s and Brik\u2019s best material witness to write about what they missed from this blatant feat of European inaction.The novel switches constantly between Brik\u2019s puerile draft on Lazarus, his sister Olga and ugly 1908 newspaper reports about often Jewish immigrants with anarchistic leanings, and the pair\u2019s travels and field research. A renewed surge of populism in press and politics may have prompted Hemon to write this book. Their Odyssey sheds light on reasons for wishing to live somewhere else: violence, stagnating economies, corruption, impunity, organized crime incl. human trafficking.What do migrants or refugees experience when they reach a host country? This is perhaps the main theme of this novel, expressed confusedly and eloquently by Brik himself. \u201cHome is where someone notices your absence\u201d, he says more than once. He comes across as a negative person, wounded, unkind, anxious, opinionated, scornful about religion, his wife\u2019s work ethic and parents, what not\u2026Aleksandar Hemon deftly wove personal names and words into a fabric of sorts across time and space by repeating e.g. s***, sardines, candy, armpit, flying carpet, home, etc.  I acknowledge its deeper messages, but also hate the miserable way he ended this book."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "So much potential, all wasted.A pointless, rambling \"buddy road trip\" novel whose worst offense is boredom, followed closely by unlikable characters and awkward \"dialogue\".My advice: skip this convoluted snoozer. Or risk ending up like me, wishing I had those hours of my life back."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Another fantastic book by Hemon."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "And he has a particular fondness for onomatopoeic words. He is much smarter and more accomplished than most of us who read books and struggle to write book reviews that we hope are coherent. You will see this as quickly as you begin reading \u201cThe Lazarus Project,\u201d a book written in beautiful English. It\u2019s amazing that Mr. Hemon was able to begin publishing in English in just a few years after emigrating to the US. Kudos are due him for this and all his considerable accomplishments.This novel is an intricate frame story of sorts. The author skillfully alternates our attention between the early nineteenth century character,Lazarus Averbuck, and Brik, the present day Bosnian-American narrator; Brik\u2019s life in the US, recollections of his past in the Balkans; his relationships to people in the US; and an on-going research trip back to Eastern Europe to do background research on eponymous Lazarus. Lazarus is a poor Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 fleeing the pogroms of Russia. He tragically meets his end at the hands the racist Chicago Chief of Police.Mr. Hemon\u2019s depiction of the people of Chicago as extreme xenophobic anti-Semites is a bit overboard. He paints the people of Chicago, and by extension the rest of the US, as paranoid racists expecting to find an anarchist in every immigrant. Clearly this extreme characterization of Americans and the juxtaposition of the narrative between the early twentieth century US and the early twenty-first century US is a thinly-veiled denunciation of current American attitudes towards Muslims and the current demagogic leadership seeking to instill fear of terrorists. This comes off as heavy-handed. Heavy-handedness is exceeded only by the irony of a Bosnian pointing out the flawed race attitudes of today\u2019s Americans."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Deftly written, wry, and striking.
