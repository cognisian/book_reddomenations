I am a fan of African-American literature, but tend to read more historical fiction than contemporary. I have also never seen the movie adaptation, so I had relatively no expectations coming into reading this.What I actually read:The author\u2019s style of writing takes a few pages to get used to. A sentence goes on, more often than not, for literally an entire page. The stream-of-consciousness style can be annoying, at times, but the rants and tangents die down the further into the plot you read. The novel focuses on a forty-something year old woman experiencing a semi-midlife crisis and enjoying a spur of the moment vacation to Jamaica. After a divorce and contemplation of a job change, the main character enjoys her newfound freedom while on her vacation. Here, she meets a twenty-something year old man who she starts to be attracted to, both physically and emotionally.What to expect:Go into this novel expecting an easy romance read. The plot line and internal character dialogue can get repetitive. (If I had a dollar for every time I read the sentence, \u201cHe\u2019s too young for me\u201d\u2026..) The overall story, though, is charming and the characters feel real and developed. At the end of the novel, I was rooting for the main character to find happiness, regardless of whether that was with a man or not. Go into the novel with an open mind to the writing style, too; you will get used to it and it may even grow on you."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "This was just painful to get through. Perhaps I disliked this book because it was written in the 90s for people in the 90s. The story (if you can call it that) has no arc. I didn't like the protagonist in this book at all, which made it that much harder to read. To me, most of the book was about Stella freaking out about Winston being 20 years younger than her, and Winston trying to convince Stella that he doesn't care about the age difference; this gets boring very quickly for the reader. There's a lot of poorly written dialogue and unnecessary descriptive details which don't add a whole lot to the story. The sex scenes were disappointing--this is where the author could have used more description (paint the picture girl!). There was no reconciliation at the end about the artist she met at the art gallery, in fact, the whole art gallery exhibition chapter might as well have been cut out from the book because there was no point to it. Very predictable, eye-rolling end.Overall, very disappointing. Can't believe they made a movie out of this (of which the movie was a little better than the book).

In fact, if she doesn't do it, it doesn't get done, from Little League carpool duty to analyzing portfolios to folding the laundry and bringing home the bacon. She does it all well, too, if her chic house, personal trainer, BMW, and her loving son are any indication. So what if there's been no one to share her bed with lately, let alone rock her world? Stella doesn't mind it too much; she probably wouldn't have the energy for love - and all of love's nasty fallout - anyway. \r\n\r\nBut when Stella takes a spur-of-the-moment vacation to Jamaica, her world gets rocked to the core - not just by the relaxing effects of the sun and sea and an island full of attractive men, but by one man in particular. He's tall, lean, soft-spoken, Jamaican, smells of citrus and the ocean - and is half her age. The tropics have cast their spell and Stella soon realizes she has come to a cataclysmic juncture: not only must she confront her hopes and fears about love, she must question all of her expectations, passions, and ideas about life and the way she has lived it. \r\n\r\nTold in Stella's own exuberant, dead-on, dead honest voice, How Stella Got Her Groove Back is full of Terry McMillan's signature humor, heart, and insight. More than a love story, it is ultimately a novel about how a woman saves her own life - and what she must risk to do it.", "asin": "0670869902", "rank": "1572871", "city": "Jamaica", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519RG1ZG1XL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
