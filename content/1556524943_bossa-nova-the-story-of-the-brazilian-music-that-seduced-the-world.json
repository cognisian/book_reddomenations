There was more detail here than I needed, but others may appreciate this detail.There is a large cast of characters represented and a lot tales and lore for each, but in the end, you've been taken on a pretty interesting journey that concentrates on Gilberto, Jobim, and their collaborators."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I couldn't put this book down. I thought I really knew some depth about Bossa Nova, but I learned so much that I didn't already know. I thought Jobim was chiefly a guitarist and piano \"dabbler\". That perception was just American marketing genius put into effect when he came to the U.S. to pair with Sinatra and become world famous. He had been a nightclub pianist for decades and daytime staff arranger for radio and TV. He \"Dabbled\" with guitar. That was an eye opener.The scope of this book is truly amazing. It covers at least a little something for every person involved. One of the primary movers on this scene was Joao Gilberto. I did not know that. I wish this author would write a book about Chorinho, or MPB or Elis Regina or whatever. I will be watching this author for whatever comes next. This was such an enjoyable book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Bossa nova is a mix of Brazilian, U.S. 50's west coast jazz and french imppresionism (Debussy, Ravel, etc) music.

Read this with my strong recommendation. you cannot find a more enjoyable source."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Bossa nova is one of the great stories of music like the British Invasion or Tin Pan Alley. If you don't already love this music, shame on you. But once you dive into Ruy Castro's book, you'll be hooked. I've read and re-read this book and love it. He's guided me to more great artists and albums than I can begin to count. I  was already into the maestro Jobim and his chief vehicle Gilberto, but when I discovered Castro's book, I discovered there was so much more. I can't recommend this book highly enough, but prepare yourself for a musical experience."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "As an earlier reviewer cited, this is great primary material.  Tons of facts.  But no writing style.  Nothing to thread it together, no themes.  It's an easy read, but it gets tedious because the book does not have an overall angle/perspective/voice.  So it's just bunches of stories and facts."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Several years ago while on a business trip to Brazil a local business associate gave me a copy of Chega de Saudade by Ruy Castro.  This was his origianal portuguese version of the translated copy; Bossa Nova: The Story of The Brazilian Music That Seduced The World.I too became seduced by the Bosa Nova at an early age back in the early sixties when the Bossa Nova sounds first found their way into the USA.Being fluent in Spanish helped me read through Chega de Saudade in Portuguese, although I always felt that I did not get the full essence of the book with the numerous side cooments the author makes, many of them very humorous.I recently decided to check Amazon to see if there existed a translated copy of Chega de Saudade.  I was shocked to find it hade been translated.  Once I received it I could not put the book down.  It is a very easy read with loads of incredible detail on the musicians and writers that made the whole Bossa Nova movement possible.  The amount of research is phenomenal.  The book reads like a novel and does a great job in transporting the reader back to the Rio de Janeiro of the fifties and early sixties.  What an incredible read.  Thank you Amazon for making it available.C.

One needs to be seeking exactly that deep level of information to appreciate the book, otherwise it will be utilized as more of a reference by subjects than a book to be consuimed cover to cover.  I did the latter and came away with a very complete understanding of the period and the people involved.  I recommend it to those seeking in depth history on the subject."}]}, "authors": ["Ruy Castro"], "isbn": "1556524943", "longitude": 0.0, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "Bossa Nova: The Story of the Brazilian Music That Seduced the World", "word_cloud": "look informative gossipy great love genre humorous look rise enjoy find skip quite page detail need others large cast character represent lot tale lore end take pretty interesting journey concentrate collaborator think really know depth learn much already know think chiefly guitarist piano dabbler perception american marketing genius put effect come pair become famous decade daytime staff arranger radio tv dabble guitar eye scope truly amaze cover least little something person involve primary mover scene know wish author watch author come next enjoyable nova mix west coast jazz french impressionism well write people event create superb introduction origin strong recommendation find enjoyable source great story british already shame dive hook love guide great artist albums begin count already maestro chief vehicle discover discover much highly enough prepare musical experience earlier reviewer cite great primary material fact write style thread together theme easy get tedious overall bunch story fact several year ago business trip local business associate give copy original portuguese version translate copy become early age back early sixty sound first find way fluent help always felt get full essence numerous side comment author make many recently decide check see exist translated copy shock find jade translate once receive easy load incredible detail musician writer make whole movement possible amount research phenomenal read great job transport back fifty early sixty incredible make thorough exhausting work subject primary source information historical evolution need seek exactly deep level information appreciate otherwise utilized reference subject consume cover cover latter come away complete understanding period people involve recommend seek depth history subject", "genres": ["Art & Architecture", "History"], "summary": "Bossa nova is one of the most popular musical genres in the world.
