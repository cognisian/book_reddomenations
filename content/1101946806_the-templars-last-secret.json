But there is always some trouble, and Bruno the Chief of Police is tasked to solve the conspiracy, in this case a group of Terrorists attempting to attack and kill a group of archaeologist that are opening a new cave and finding a secret tomb. This part of France is famous for cave drawings, Neanderthal man's expression of their animal world, and of course Templar's secret activities. I enjoy this novel most as an Audio CD. It isn't necessarily a fast pace action novel but you definitely get the feel for the people, the food, the politics, and when trouble comes, they get their game on. Definitely one of Walker's better in his series, but all of them a excellent and you might enjoy reading a prior novel so that you are familiar with the main characters."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Many characters from recent and early novels appear as history from local and far off lands are woven with current threats in vintage Martin Walker style.

However, there is nothing fresh in this novel; it is too true (for my tastes) to the news that we hear everyday: those able to grab the headlines do so. \"Terrorism\" almost becomes a clich\u00e9.  That it would spill over into the south of France given that nation's particular international and ethnic history should not be a surprise.  However, it seems that even Bruno cannot escape into the place in which we all spend much more time: the kitchen."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "It was very boring not well written in my opinion.

His grasp of the Perigord region is impressive-food, culture, geography and life style. In addition, one learns of history and current issues that impact France.

As an Israeli, living near Jerusalem, I love escaping into the French countryside. The last thing I wanted was a lot of stuff about terrorists, Israelis and our \"wonderful\" Mossad. The golden dome that you see on television when Israel is mentioned is NOT the al-Aksa mosque. It is not a mosque at all. It is the Dome of the Rock, so Martin, if you have to write about us, at least get it right! The only reason I gave it any stars at all is the usual mix of good characters, good wine, good food,and gorgeous countryside. If you are a Bruno fan, this is the one to pass on."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The action scenes were really exciting and Bruno\u2019s love interests believable.

This time a mysterious death brings ancient secrets to light, and it's up to our hero--and favorite gourmand--to connect the tangled threads of past and present \r\n\r\nWhen a woman's body is found at the foot of a cliff near St. Denis, Bruno suspects a connection to the great ruin that stands on the cliff above: the Ch\u00e2teau de Commarque, a long-ago Knights Templar stronghold which, along with the labyrinth of prehistoric caves beneath it, continues to draw the interest of scholars. With the help of Am\u00e9lie, a young newcomer to the Dordogne, Bruno learns that the dead woman was an archaeologist searching for a religious artifact of incredible importance, the discovery of which could have dramatic repercussions throughout the Middle East--not to mention in St. Denis. And the woman's ties to Islamic terrorists can only heighten the pressure on Bruno to unravel the centuries-old mystery. Meanwhile, an old flame of Bruno's is assigned to work with him on the case, and the two find time, naturellement, to enjoy the supreme pleasures of the wine, food, and beauty of the Dordogne.\r\n\r\n\u201cEnchanting.\u201d The New York Times ", "asin": "1101946806", "rank": "44867", "city": "Toulouse", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51rU7oNykaL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
