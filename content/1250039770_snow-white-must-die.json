It is not the last time I will read her.  Already started on another.  The workings of the German police system is actually so much like it is in the states.

The plot is dense with a lot of characters. The beginning is interesting but at about a third of the book, the story veers from implausible to absurd. It is one of those books where everybody is hiding something and the detectives themselves don't do any detecting - facts just fall into their laps with regular frequency.
