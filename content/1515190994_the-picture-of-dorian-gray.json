The main plot of the story revolves around a man named Dorian Gray, who captivates the attention of an artist, Basil Hallward. Basil spends his days painting portraits of Dorian, until one day Lord Henry casually has a conversation with Dorian about the fleeting nature of beauty and youth. After this discussion, Dorian has an outburst, as he begins to see the paintings as a reminder that he will one day lose his youth. However, these portraits will stay with him, and change as he changes.As the story continues, I began seeing Dorian as very unstable, and defiantly dealing with mental illness. Dorian becomes engaged to a young actress named Sibyl, who eventually commits suicide after Dorian ends the engagement. The book then fast forwards eighteen years, when Basil approaches Dorian after hearing Dorians reputation being tarnished throughout London. The interaction between Dorian and Basil ends with Dorian murdering Basil. A few months pass by and Dorian grows older, and crazier. When Dorian, finds his portrait he uses the same knife he used to kill Basil to try and destroy it. However, the story ends with Dorian's servants opening the door to see Dorian with a knife plunged through his heart, and the portrait of Dorian as a young man lying beside him. Overall I truly enjoyed reading this book. I found the plot to be very interesting because I enjoy reading about the dark aspects of human nature. Although I liked the majority of the book, I found some parts of the plot confusing.

In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press. \r\n\r\nWilde revised and expanded the magazine edition of The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) for publication as a novel; the book edition (1891) featured an aphoristic preface \u2014 an apologia about the art of the novel and the reader. \r\n\r\nThe content, style, and presentation of the preface made it famous in its own literary right, as social and cultural criticism. In April 1891, the editorial house Ward, Lock and Company published the revised version of The Picture of Dorian Gray.", "asin": "1515190994", "rank": "25380", "city": "London", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ypa-yhQyL.jpg", "country": "England", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
