Wildly famous, filthy rich, Bucky is a rock star at the apex of his career.Until he walks out on all of it to live like a vagrant in a run down apartment in New York City.See, Bucky is bored. Of the music. The noise. The fame. Of himself. He knows neither who he really is, or even why he is that person.Take a slow, rambling and often surreal ride through the eyes of Bucky Wunderlick. Bored rock star. Philosopher. Accidental cartel middleman.Along the way, you'll discover that fame can come at a cost, that even the famous can experience existential crises and maybe even learn a thing or two about your own existence.Told from the first person perspective and in a rambling, near stream of consciousness manner reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy, Great Jones Street is as much a philosophical conversation with a novel protagonist as it is a novel.Highly recommended."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "DeLillo is in my top three list of living American novelists.

Well, there\u2019s the occasional visit from his girlfriend and members of his rock group and hawkers connected with a Happy Valley Commune yammering about a future miracle drug, enough visits to keep his sharp edge very sharp and enough visits to possibly drive a crazy boy crazy.And here's our man, the one and only Bucky Wunderlick, musing on the mystical nature of his girlfriend and soulmate, the incomparable Opel: \"All she desired was the brute electricity of that sound. To forget everything. To be that sound. That was the only tide she heeded. She wanted to exist as music does, nowhere, beyond the maps of language.\" A batch of reasons why this novel by Don DeLillo is fab:THE BOX MAN, AMERICAN-STYLEWithin months of publication of \u201cGreat Jones Street\u201d another new novel hit the shelves addressing many of the same themes: \u201cThe Box Man\u201d by Nobel winning Japanese novelist, K\u014db\u014d Abe, where the nameless protagonist surrenders his previous identity and conventional routine to live in a large cardboard box he wears over his head. \u201cGreat Jones Street\u201d and \u201cThe Box Man\u201d \u2013 so into yourself, so \u201csociety get out of my face.\u201d At one point in DeLillo\u2019s novel, girlfriend Opel tells Bucky about a new underground counterculture group: \u201cThe return of the private man, according to them, is the only way to destroy the notion of mass man.\u201d Oh, Opel. Oh, Bucky. Oh, Box Man. This is so 70s! Sidebar: I recall watching a 1970s newscast where a university student wore a black cloth over his head down to his shoes and walked around campus calling himself \u201cthe black bag.\u201d Actually, I thought this guy really cool.POETRYAt one point, Bucky reflects: \u201cAlone I lived in the emergency of minutes, in phases of dim compliance with the mind\u2019s turning hand.\u201d And here\u2019s another of his rock-and-roll reveries: \u201cEuphoric with morphine we\u2019d be wheeled among them, noting proportions and contours, admiring the beauty of what we were.\u201d It\u2019s as if Bucky\u2019s words could have been excerpts from Alan Ginsberg\u2019s many page beatnik slam-poem \u201cHowl.\u201d And there are numerous other such Bucky rant-lines for fans of DeLillo\u2019s poetic, philosophic prose.THE WRITER IN THE APARTMENT ABOVE\u201cSome writers presume to be men of letters. I\u2019m a man of numbers.\u201d So says the novelist, essayist, poet, short story writer Fenig, who lives in the apartment on Great Jones Street right above Bucky and who is a writer obsessed with seeking fame and knowing the ups and downs of the writer\u2019s market better than a seasoned stock broker knows Wall Street. Don DeLillo, you sly dog, putting a writer who might be the shadow side of yourself in the apartment above your protagonist.ROCK-AND-ROLL, THE NEW MODERN ARTIn an interview, Bucky pontificates how when people read a book or look at a painting, they just sit there or stand there, but through his music, he makes people move. WOW! The one and only Bucky Wunderlick, shining star, prime mover, kinesthetic force, creator of a new political-erotic-mystical art form that, as sculptor Claes Oldenburg insisted, does more than just sit on its ass in a museum.SOCIAL COMMENTARYAgain, Don DeLillo fans will not be disappointed since many are the zingers hurled at contemporary American society. For example, how TV programs are interrupted and announcers sound close to insanity, their voices soaring, as they report on the impending snowstorm: heavy snow, deep snow, drifting snow, big fluffy white flakes are falling and will continue to fall from the sky. (I myself am always both amused and amazed at the panic snow arouses in the media). And, again: Bucky has issues with his hard-earned money having to work . . . no, no, no, he did the work; he wants his money resting in nice big green stacks in some cool bank vault. He\u2019s told in so many words: so sorry, Bucky, like it or not, your rich ass is tied into the American financial world!BUCKY\u2019S MAGICAL MYSTERY TOURInserted into the first-person narrative is the Superslick Mind-Contracting Media Kit featuring \u201cThe Bucky Wunderlick Story\u201d told in various news clips, song lyrics and Zen-like enigmatic responses to interviewers. All very fitting since Bucky\u2019s words have that ring of rock-and-roll truth, when he states further on in the story, \u201cBeauty is dangerous in narrow times, a knife in the slender neck of the rational man, and only those who live between the layers of these strange days can know its name and shape.\u201d Yea, baby! Hearing such wisdom I have to ask: What\u2019s the sound of one Bucky turning at thirty-three and a third, second cut, side one, third album?THE FIGURATIVE DEATH-IN-LIFE JOURNEYBucky wants us to know his solitary journey on Great Jones Street is only the literal way of looking at things. Figuratively, he tells us, he lived in a remote monastery with the lamas of Tibet, being guided through the mysteries of the highest levels, the most esoteric planes of death. That\u2019s what he came to know. Death-in-life.Oh, how cool is that! Thanks, Don D.

The story is about a leader of a rock & roll band who walks away from a concert tour and returns to his shabby apt in NYC (the Great Jones St area).  There are some interesting characters, drugs, record executives, girlfriends etc but the whole thing did not really come together for me.  I recall reading that DeLillo refers to writing as intense thinking but this book does not include his better thinking in my view.  However, he's a heck of a thinker and a writer with great insights on the state of our culture.  If you have not read any of DeLillo's works then please do, he's an American talent.  An Italian-American lad from the Bronx."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Rock and roll and nihlism never made so much sense."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Rugged NYC tour de force."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Bucky Wunderlick is the lead singer and song writer of a successful hard rock band. On tour, the burned-out Bucky realizes the band has reached the scary limit of its loud and raw sound and he suddenly drops out. Bucky then becomes the subject of bizarre rumors and bogus sightings while he lives on Great Jones Street, which, before the boom in New York City real estate, was grim and seedy. This Bucky, who is wasted and drifting, has \"no intentions.\" But then Opel, his girlfriend, appears and forces him to address these questions: What do you do when something ends? How will you evolve?As a musician, Bucky finally decides he \"needed a route back\". But will his route back resemble that of his band mate Azarian, who evolves and affirms his own musicality in soul music? Or will Bucky's route back follow the vision of Globke, his agent, who has brilliant ideas about promoting Bucky's celebrity and is indifferent to his music. Or will Bucky follow the path of the musician Watney, who realized his own mediocrity and evolved through business? Or, will Bucky find a musical equivalent of Fenig, his upstairs neighbor, who is a writer seeking success through the exploitation of market niches?In offering these alternatives to Bucky, DeLillo also begins in a very dark space. In particular, all these options for Bucky's personal evolution are opposed by the sinister Happy Valley Farm Commune. This sees Bucky's musical withdrawal as a principled stand for independence and privacy. Happy Valley, by the way, apparently has two factions, one of them nihilistic and violent as it enforces its beliefs.As Bucky is exposed to these musical possibilities, he also becomes a passive participant in a dangerous drug deal. In this case, Opel, Azarian, and Watney each seek to acquire a \"package\" that Bucky keeps in his living room and that contains the ultimate recreational drug. The drug, which is the property of the Happy Valley Farm Commune, is also a matter of interest to the drug legend Dr. Pepper, who makes several wildly entertaining appearances in GJS. My favorite occurs in Chapter 18, where Dr. Pepper explains that he wants the package since he, like everyone else in GREAT JONES STREET, is trying to evolve. In this case, Dr. Pepper wants to make the package his platform for a final creative and professional breakthrough.GJS is my eleventh DeLillo novel. IMO, GJS is a superb effort that showcases the great Don's glittering and terse prose, hilarious and insightful associations, and his unmistakable and inimitable voice. But unlike many of DeLillo's later novels, GJS has a protagonist who, while on the fringe, has not fully dropped out. This is quite different from\u00a0Falling Man: A Novel,Point Omega: A Novel, and\u00a0The Body Artist: A Novel, where much of the tension exists in a protagonist's familiar marginality and creepy normalcy.  Don, BTW, solves the issue of the ultimately eloquent Bucky's marginality in a surprising and perfect last chapter.This is an excellent and highly entertaining novel and is highly recommended."}]},
