Vanity Fair by William Makepeace Thackeray (Novel-E Book-Fiction) 5* Originally \u201cThe Novel Without a Hero\u201d, which more or less is about the gist of it, as even the character Colonel William Dobbin is not without some flaws.  The author certainly is a loquacious writer and no doubt his mind was muddled at times and certainly his pen hand cramped with the volume of pages of this work.  Published as a 19 volume series between 1847-1848, it's meant to reflect early 19th century society of England, told with wit and satire.  As the reader follows the lives of Amelia Sedley and Rebecca Sharp, we don't have to  wait long to determine each ladies character, Amelia being na\u00efve and Rebecca unscrupulous and rather ruthless at times.  Their paths cross many times during the course of the narrative and not always in a good way.  I thought it was an excellent story and well written which I thoroughly enjoyed.  \u201cAh, Vanitas Vattatum! Which of us is happy in this world?  Which of us has his desire? Or, having it is satisfied? -come, children, let us shut up the box and the puppets, for our play is played out\u201d William Makepeace Thackeray and thus ends Vanity Fair."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "This review is not for the contents.

Pure brilliance.

Thackeray's complex writing style and the deep satire made the reading very difficult for a high schooler in the early 1960s.  However, the satire & comedic characters (and names) made this second reading a pleasure and fun, especially after my years of experience in the interim that included witnessing the final remnants of the British class system at work in the UK companies that I managed.  It's an academic read; but I recommend it..."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "During my misspent youth I avoided books like this like plague. James Bond anyone? Any way, I got old and started backtracking a little. Maybe a little more patient and a little more insightful. Wanted to see why classics became classics.Anyway, I really liked this book. Although obviously written a looong time ago, it has a certain modernity to it. For a buck on kindle, give it a try. You will need to stick with it for awhile before it starts picking up.

Her sentimental companion Amelia, however, longs only for caddish soldier George. \r\n\r\nAs the two heroines make their way through the tawdry glamour of Regency society, battles\u2014military and domestic\u2014are fought, fortunes made and lost. The one steadfast and honourable figure in this corrupt world is Dobbin with his devotion to Amelia, bringing pathos and depth to Thackeray's gloriously satirical epic of love and social adventure.
