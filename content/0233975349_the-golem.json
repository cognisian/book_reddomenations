Singer makes you dive into Prague and the story about the Golem at tremendous speed, with his unique style while constantly referring to jewels of the Jewish tradition. Highly recommended."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "There is a reason Isaac B. Singer won the Nobel Prize for literature, and it can be found in the novella, THE GOLEM. In very conversational, precise language, this is the quintessential storyteller at the height of his full narrative power. A page-turner, for sure."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I remember reading this book from a 1980's edition. The illustrations were all in black & white. I liked this version of the Golem because it give a background into Jewish life in Prague in the Middle Ages, and how the Jews were pretty much at the mercy of the local populace and how the Jews were required by law to be second-class citizens.My problem with the book is the last chapter, where the wife uses the Golem for some far-out treasure hunting project, breaking the \"safety mechanism\" in the Golem (in the original story the Rabbi just gets careless and uses the Golem for \"help\"). The part where the servant falls in love with the \"evolving\" Golem was silly. The story doesn't need a romantic subplot, and I can't see a love-struck teenage girl being attracted to a large clay statue.Nonetheless, the illustrations are great and any kid who likes Harry Potter ought to like this story."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The Golem, as told by IB Singer, is a traditional Jewish mystical short story of a superhuman giant, made of clay, who is brought to life by the most religious rabbi in order to save Jews in times of trouble.  And although it is a \"children's\" story, there are many layers of symbolism to keep adults interested.  This particular edition was especially well done.  I appreciated the artwork and overall esthetic presentation of the book.I came to this book after reading Michael Chabon's Pulitzer Prize winning The Amazing Adventures of Kavallier and Clay, the \"Clay\" in the title being the last name of one of the main characters, but also the substance from which the rabbi made the golem.  Chabon heavily alludes to and borrows from this story, the Golem of Prague, though never quite lets the reader know that this is what he's referring to, almost assuming that the reader already knows about it, which is for most people not the case.  So it was especially rewarding to finally read the story."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This seeming children's story is really a parable for adults (which children can enjoy and eventually get on another level when they are ready).  There are many well crafted sentences about the spiritual life, how to surrender into trusting God to take care of your life, about the hidden saints who help our life on Earth work, how to use our free choice, how to live in community with others, how to relate to believers and nonbelievers, how to handle being falsely accused, and how to be humble with power.  You can taste a whole way of life behind the story which might be worth living or open it at random and find some messages that relate to challenges we meet in daily life."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The Golem is one fo the best known Singer short stories.  Its theme is a Golem, a mythical figure imbued with life by cabalistic magic to help the Jewish people in a time of need.This story begins with persecutions on Jews in Prague, which is when the Golem is sent to Reb Leib.  After helping the Jews in their objective, Reb Leib decides to use the Golem, with its incredible strenght, for a less noble pursuit, which is when the Golem starts to disobey him.  The story unfolds with the Golem, a creature made of clay, turning more and more human, with the mauturity of a child but enormous strenght.  The probelms mount as the Golem destroys all in his way, falls in love (reciprocatedly) and gets drafted by the emperor.The short story evokes many deep issues, such as what it means to be human, what one should do with unending power, what one should do to preserve the peace, and many others.  Though originally a childrens story, any adult would enjoy it.  It is the type of story that leaves one reflecting about certain issues for days."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "El Golem tiene todos los ingredientes que necesita un relato para funcionar, pero en este caso, adem\u00e1s, est\u00e1 escrito por Singer.
