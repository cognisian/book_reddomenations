The subject is an appallingly violent period in the history of Latin America - the war between the Maoist guerrillas of Sendero Luminoso and the Peruvian state.  The setting is Easter 2000, Holy Week in Ayacucho.We begin with crime fiction. The novel obeys some of the rules and realises some of the expectations of that genre - well to begin with. The cases are a series of brutal murders.The investigator is Assistant Prosecutor Felix Chacaltana Saldivar, a curious man who initially took my sympathy and even  affection.  He is a deeply conscientious official, na\u00efve and honest. He left Lima after being dumped by his wife for lack of ambition. He is now in a backwater, he believes, where the war is definitely over - so his superiors insist, until the corpses show up.As the body count rises he relentlessly follows procedures with a faith in official justice. This faith is to be sorely tested. As the love interest we have Edith, a young waitress in a restaurant with seriously rare cuisine. For good measure he has a curious relationship with his mother , his mamacita.Black comedy merges with sadism as the narrative flows into horror. A prolonged description of rape was shocking. By the end we are in a disturbing world that mixes the supernatural and the psychotic. We have descended into hell. As dark April, the cruellest month, turns towards May it feels like the apocalypse has arrived in the Andes.I was reminded of the\u00a0The Secret in Their Eyes\u00a0- about the dirty war in Argentina.  There are similarities between  Saldivar and Benjamin Chapparro, the justice official in Sacheri's novel. However, Saldivar lacks a basic humanity.  Perhaps we are to think that he was perverted by the terror war - but if there was hope in Argentina, why not Peru?There are chilling echoes of this fiction in the murderous actions of ISIS today in Iraq. The influence of Conrad's novel is also obvious. Maybe that was the point - there is no justice, no resolution, just blood without hope - sacrifice without redemption. It was too dark for me."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Peru is a beautiful country with an abundance of striking differences in its people and landscape.  The one thing that has kept it in shackles is its the inability to look at itself objectively and deal with the realities of injustice and cruelty.  This book is like looking through a family album because it is so accurate in its depiction of the government and military life.  Yet it also has a tenderness that reveals how people cope with 20% inflation and economic stagnation that results in a complete break down of any hope.  I believe this author is amazing at displaying truth and intrigue and I expect even greater works from him.  Viva Peru!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "\"Red April\" won a prestigious award in Spain. Although there are points at which this novel loses its thread, for the most part, it can keep you on the edge of your seat wondering exactly what will happen next and why. Nothing seems to add up, until the last few pages, as the main character tries out various theories.This novel, set in Ayacucho, where the Shining Path was born, has been harshly criticized by some in Peru. There are details of Peruvian military, police, judiciary and fire arms that are, apparently, in error and which indicate a degree of sloppiness \"unacceptable\" in a thriller. (You and I won't notice.) However, their real criticism is that the book trivializes the internal conflict that consumed 70,000 lives in Peru, turning it into merely the backdrop for a series of bizarre murders that consume the principal character, Chacaltana. The same could be said for crime novels that use WWII, Nazi terror or other horrific backdrops, but those who are so close in time and place to the violence of those years have a right to be sensitive.Other objections--such as the one that the novel portrays indigenous Peruvians as crude and violent bumpkins who speak Quechua gibberish--I think may be misplaced. As I read it, the novel intends(in part)to portray how the outsider elites--all people from Lima and other parts of the coast--view the indigenous people of the highlands. Although Chacaltana, as a low-ranking mestizo official, has to endure the ridicule of army, police and political players, he is not immune to plenty of prejudices of his own because, in essence, he is a Limeno, a man from the capital.Chacaltana is pretty hard to take in his incredible naivete, and some readers have thrown up their hands and thrown out the book. But he is the consummate bureaucrat; Americans have had much less contact with these types than Latin Americans have. He is a pretty strange guy. If you have seen the film \"Ojos que no ven\" (What the Eyes don't See) by Peruvian director Francisco Lombardi, I could visualize him as the nerdy clerk in the Ministry of Justice--but with a law degree.As far as the translation is concerned, the stilted language that one reviewer complained of is due to the intentionally stilted translations of Chacaltana's reports, written in bureaucratic legalese. (See very similar military communiques in Vargas Llosa's \"Pantaleon y las visitadoras,\" hysterically funny in Spanish and much less so in English.) I did find the translation of the mysterious illiterate ramblings (never explained until the end) over the top. These sections could have been done a bit more subtly and still retained the flavor of the original, I think."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I didn't like this book, and there are a lot of reasons for that. It is, first of all, such a guy book. By that, I mean that some books appeal more to male readers (if they appeal to anyone at all), while others are identifiably chick books -- think Oprah's picks, and tell me if I am wrong. This book is completely a dude book, and I am not a dude. There are, however, more reasons for my disappointment than that. The next reason is that it's hard to write a good mystery, and Roncagliolo doesn't succeed in doing so. He instead resorts to the device used by so many authors of ill-conceived mysteries: vagueness. Because he can't be straighforward without giving away the plot, he obfuscates, and little is more dissatisfying to a reader than not being able to figure out what's going on. That's the initial cause for me losing interest in the book, and it occurred about a third of the way through. A little further on came the second bane of mystery writers: predictability. This occurs about halfway into the story, where you see the ending coming from a mile away. From there on, all of the increasingly preposterous twists and turns only seem the more pathetic and desperate. Amidst it all, there are two genuine surprises, but they are too late, and they won't make you like the book more. They will increase your disdain for the narrator, and your impatience to be done with this, already. I was heartily relieved by the time I finished the book, and left wondering whatever inspired me to pick it up in the first place. So, unless you are a total dude who likes bad mysteries, mixed with mytic religion, and topped with Peruvian terrorism, you can pass on Red April without the slightest worry you're missing out on something good."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "First Line: On Wednesday, the eighth day of March, 2000, as he passed through the area surrounding his domicile in the locality of Quinna, Justino Mayta Carazo (31) discovered a body.Felix Chacaltana Saldivar is an unambitious prosecutor living in Lima, Peru. Haunted by his mother, abandoned by his wife, Felix loves literature and devotes an entire room of his house (and a good percentage of his waking thoughts) to the spirit of his dead mother. For some reason known only to the gods he has been put in charge of a strange murder investigation, which twists and turns to its surprising conclusion.Well... I'm going to assume it's a surprising conclusion because I just could not finish this book. One part of my brain loved the look into the politics and country of Peru and didn't want to stop reading. The other part of my brain was so disappointed by the main character and the writing style that I did stop.I'll talk about the writing style first. I should know better than to get a book which contains the following words in its description: \"stunning\", \"self-assured\", \"clarity of style\", \"complexity\", \"riveting\", \"profound\", and \"deft artistry\".  99% of the time when I read the book, I'm simply stunned and let it go at that. There was a sly, arch tone to the writing that I found alternately confusing and annoying.If I wanted to be blunt, I'd say that Felix Chacaltana Saldivar was too dumb to live. Evidently he's spent way too much time in that room talking to his dead mother. The room and the talking to the dead may be a cultural tradition, but he carried it to excess.I reached the point of no return when Felix went to a village to investigate. He had an idea going in that the area was very unstable politically. When he got there, he was told that it, indeed, was a very dangerous place to be. So what does he proceed to do? He takes the moral high ground when questioning people, and he won't stop questioning why laws are not being enforced. Yes, I do have morals, and yes, I do believe in law enforcement-- but not when you're putting people's lives in danger. Felix, having the luck of the naive and stupid, can leave that village and return home. The villagers he questions must remain there and hope they live to see the sun rise in the morning.Enough of my complaints. I've seen by several other reviews that other people have read and enjoyed Red April. Unless you're the type of reader who is annoyed by many of the same things I outlined above, you may well be one of them. I sincerely hope that you are."}]}, "authors": ["Santiago Roncagliolo"], "isbn": "0307388387", "longitude": -77.0365256, "periods": ["2000s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "Red April", "word_cloud":
