I read A Farewell to Arms many years ago and remembered liking it better (perhaps it was shorter?).  I stuck with it, and did like how it ended.  But the copy I had contained numerous typos, which seems weird for a classic like this, and I found certain things annoying, like saying \"the\" Pilar or \"the Maria\" at times (but not at others).  I found this in another review - it was strange how he used the word \"obscenity\" instead of using a curse word.  A quote near the end I enjoyed: \"War is a bitchery\".  Shouldn't it have been \"War is an obscenity\"?  Glad I read it, but done with Hemingway."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Classic!

Three years later he completed the greatest novel to emerge from \"the good fight,\" For Whom the Bell Tolls.\r\n\r\nThe story of Robert Jordan, a young American in the International Brigades attached to an antifascist guerilla unit in the mountains of Spain, it tells of loyalty and courage, love and defeat, and the tragic death of an ideal. In his portrayal of Jordan's love for the beautiful Maria and his superb account of El Sordo's last stand, in his brilliant travesty of La Pasionaria and his unwillingness to believe in blind faith, Hemingway surpasses his achievement in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms to create a work at once rare and beautiful, strong and brutal, compassionate, moving, and wise.\r\n\r\n\"If the function of a writer is to reveal reality,\" Maxwell Perkins wrote Hemingway after reading the manuscript, \"no one ever so completely performed it.\"\r\n\r\nGreater in power, broader in scope, and more intensely emotional than any of the author's previous works, it stands as one of the best war novels of all time.", "asin": "0684803356", "rank": "8147", "city": "Madrid", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ITaxhiA8L.jpg", "country": "Spain", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
