A clear demonstration of the struggles of the extreme poor.

This classic book which consists of verbatim transcripts of the Sanchez family tells the story in compelling, riveting human terms. What's it like to have a father who lashes out at his children one minute, supports them in the next? To have a single room shared by extended family, with people sleeping on the floor, on makeshift beds, sometimes standing up for each other, more often fighting for space and for place. In the literature of poverty (a large and expanding reading list) this book is a must-read--and must-share."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Wow, This is a great book!
