(You may need strong reading glasses to make out some of the text.) Alan Moore is an indefatigable researcher and brilliant storyteller. Eddie Campbell's spidery, scratchy drawings suit the murky mood of the story. (And even so, when called upon to render historic London architecture, Campbell\u2019s panels burst into glorious, meticulous copperplate-etching-type, scaled architecture-textbook detail and quality.)This book gripped me from front to back. The conspiracy Moore conjures, supported by 42 pages of dense notes and an additional graphic appendix, unfolds splendidly. It includes, of course, the London neighborhoods, and volumes (or is it simple myriad panels) on 19th century social mores, to include, yes, all those whores and other species of \u201cloose women\u201d and, to our eyes today, reprehensible men, but also \u2013 for those who are unprepared, but this is no spoiler, because the Ripper stories have been in circulation for sometimes more than a century \u2013 royalty, to include Victoria, Druidism and the Old Gods, Freemasonry and its secrets and rituals, icons on 19th century art, architecture, and literature, details of contemporary police and Scotland Yard procedure, and, believe me, very much more, crammed into its  572 pages.And on my next visit to London I'm going to bring with me chapter 4, as my guide to the buildings of Nicholas Hawksmoor. For an architecture buff, as I am, who has stomped around London peering into old churches and ancient structures, as I have, chapter 4, and its beautiful renderings of some of London\u2019s greatest churches, was a particular unexpected, delightful serendipity.I would urge every reader to narrate chapter 14 aloud, in the most refined English accent they are capable of producing. I found it to be a chilling reading experience.And parents, if the title fails to warn you sufficiently, do examine the contents closely before leaving this one out for the kiddies on a rainy Saturday. The copy I read had no \"for mature readers only\" markings. From Hell is most assuredly for mature readers only and deserves, at the very least, an \u201cNC-17\u201d rating.This is simply a terrific read and one that, I see from other reviews, will require from many a measure of patience. Moore unfolds his tale at what some will find a too-leisurely pace. Other readers have greater toleration for both glacial pace and a carefully studied narrative ambiguity. For those of us who wallow in detail, texture, and explanatory endnotes, as well as a horror stories that, in the end, are truly disturbing, this should be just the ticket."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of graphic novels.

I just realized upon reading this that I don't enjoy graphic novels.  There was just a bit to many violent and sexual scenes that I thought added very little to the story, but just were put there for shock value.Even though it wasn't my taste, I could see the value in this book.  The story has some interesting philosophical moments and it does make you think.  So if you enjoy graphic novels, this might be something you like.  If you aren't sure of that style, I would say stay away."}]}, "authors": ["Alan Moore"], "isbn": "0958578346", "longitude": -0.12574, "periods": ["1800s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "From Hell", "word_cloud": "amaze absolutely spellbind make treasure available masterful work fiction everyone ingenious hatch theory case fly face good civilized victorian peak wen wart suppurate perhaps greatest graphic yet produce oftentimes nearly illegible letter reduce page size normal size strong reading glass make text indefatigable researcher brilliant storyteller spidery scratchy drawing suit murky mood story even call render historic architecture panel burst glorious meticulous scale detail quality grip back conspiracy conjures support page dense note additional graphic appendix unfolds splendidly include course neighborhood volume simple myriad panel century social more include yes whore specie loose woman eye today reprehensible men also unprepared spoiler stories circulation sometimes century royalty include secret rituals icon century art architecture literature detail contemporary police procedure believe much cram next visit go bring chapter guide building architecture buff stomp peer old church ancient structure chapter beautiful rendering greatest church particular unexpected delightful narrate chapter aloud refine accent capable produce find chill read parent fails warn sufficiently examine content closely leave kiddy rainy copy mature reader marking assuredly mature reader deserves least simply terrific see review require many measure patience unfolds tale find pace other reader greater toleration glacial pace carefully study narrative ambiguity wallow detail texture explanatory end notes well horror story end truly disturb ticket definitely anyone fan graphic novel however younger audience feature gruesome murder gratuitous sex drawing good seller great not finish reading good far got make wonder really brand new corner dent spine opening cover page rip purchase son request delight see people enjoy fan graphic style compelling complex story realize read enjoy graphic novel bit many violent sexual scene think add little story put shock taste value story interesting philosophical moment make think enjoy graphic novel something sure style away", "genres": ["Comics & Graphic Novels", "Fiction & Literature", "Historical Fiction", "True Crime"], "summary": "Legendary comics writer Alan Moore and artist Eddie Campbell have created a gripping, hallucinatory piece of crime fiction about Jack the Ripper.
