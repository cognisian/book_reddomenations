Inspector Jose Afonso Coehlo investigates the gruesome murder of a young woman in Lisbon, Portugal, 1998. In 1941, in Berlin, Germany, Oswald Lehrer, a high ranking Nazi, forcibly employs Klaus Felson, a German industrialist, to work for the Nazis in Portugal.Coehlo\u2019s investigation leads to political intrigue, stolen wealth and powerful men who battle the morals of law and order in the complicated murder mystery full of unexpected twists.  The characters and the intertwining relationships are equally complex and detailed.  The style is terse though descriptive of characters, events, with historic scenes of Berlin and Portugal, and scenes of present day Lisbon.  The author doles out information in small but interesting doses."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I was thoroughly confused while reading and after reading.

Try this one at your own risk."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I purchased this book in anticipation of a trip to Portugal. I did not get to it until I returned but found it cemented what I felt about the place and people. It portrays the citizenship as I experienced it and told a story which covered 50 years of history and many areas within the country. All in all, an enjoyable book with a. varied array of characters."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very interesting melding of modern crime drama with WWII history.
