Some aspects of it remain both powerfully insightful and hilarious of the sort that creates belly-ache laughter.But it is also horribly misogynistic and makes violence against women a joke. I could not in good conscience give this to a young person to read without a whole presentation on how to read in the context of it's time. I think this basic inhumanity cripples the work, and invalidates much of it from surviving as a classic in the greater sense of the word.Three stars is the average of extremes: some five star passages and some zero star passages."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Very bad spelling mistakes and low quality"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "The font is comic sans!
