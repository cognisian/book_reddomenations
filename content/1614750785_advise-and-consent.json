The prose is clear and well written, but not exceptional. The plotting moves along with twists and turns, but fails to convince me at key points. First, when Anderson meets his lover in Honolulu, he succumbs more quickly than I would expect of a Mormon. Second, the passage of the photograph from hand to hand in the fashion described requires too many timely coincidences. Third, Cooley\u2019s discovery of James Morton\u2019s identity is another stretch. It seems to me that all three of these situations could have been handled more believably with more work on the part of the author. For me, the book went dead from the half-way point to about page 500. Then it picked up again. Drury made the mistake of projecting history and technology on a short historical line when he had the Russians arriving on the moon based on the launching of Sputnik. Adding the president\u2019s two terms to the Eisenhower administration (which Drury identifies) and the next election one year away, the book takes place in 1967. This approximates the Russians actual attempted moon landing correctly with their goals, but its projected success is, of course, completely wrong as they have never achieved a successful manned landing, ever. My final criticism is that he telegraphs the Leffingwell\u2019s fate too soon and spoils a chance for suspense. In the end, I feel its saving grace is as a political expos\u00e9, but one that could have been done in maybe 450 pages."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I found this book captivating but not surprising.
