Book is full of technical information and although the pictures his words paint are beautiful, it does get tedious to read.  The references are interesting historically.  But the immense sadness, despair, and greed demonstrated by the characters make the book depressing.  I finished it in 3 days because I kept waiting/looking for the happiness/good.  I regret that I did not find what I wanted.  I would NOT read the others in this series by Mr. Zola."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I didn't want to like this book. A novel about the birth of the modern department store? How could that be interesting? And once again, Zola proves me wrong. I think he could take any subject and make it gripping. Although it was set during the time of the Second Empire of France, much of the plot is as relevant today as when it was written.Two chapters were particularly captivating: one about the day of the first big sale\u2014the imagery of the river sucking in the customers was addictive\u2014and another about the demise of the artisan shopkeepers using the metaphor of a death and the subsequent funeral and mourning. The protagonist, Denise, is among the few of Zola's characters in the Rougon-Macquart cycle who is sympathetic and honorable throughout the story. The transformation of Octave Mouret, who we got to know in Pot Luck (Pot Bouille), is a pleasant surprise. He was such a unlikeable character in the earlier novel. In this story, we witness growth and admire his brilliance in business."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Have enjoyed the book almost as much as the television series"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Loved the book.

The store is a symbol of capitalism, of the modern city, and of the bourgeois family: it is emblematic of changes in consumer culture and the changes in sexual attitudes and class relations taking place at the end of the century. This new translation of the eleventh novel in the Rougon-Macquart cycle captures the spirit of one of Zola's greatest works.\r\n\r\n", "asin": "0199536902", "rank": "122080", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JHtKm85cL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
