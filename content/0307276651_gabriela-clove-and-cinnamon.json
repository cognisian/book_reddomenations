Well, I've been to Ilheus, Brazil (where the story takes place) twice and thought I'd enjoy the book even more than the average person, as I could envision the location.  I just didn't get this story.  I didn't care for the characters, the events in the town; nothing about the story grabbed my interest.  I asked 2 Brazilian friends about why the book is considered one of the best Brazilian novels. They both said they started the book and couldn't finish it.  They said it's important from a historical perspective on Brazil.  I'm surprised myself I found nothing to like in this story.  I'm open minded and find something of value in virtually everything, but it looks like there's a first time for everything.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author worked hard in writing it.  As others suggested, he keeps many stories going. Unfortunately, I didn't care for any of them.  I think a 1 star is for when the author is lazy and the book is badly written.  In this case, it's well written, Amado clearly worked his butt off on the story, but (maybe me and my 2 friends are weird) I found staring out my window more interesting than this simple-minded story of small town life in Brazil."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of the best writers of Brazil, every character of this book is a magic description of a human being,"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book is unreal!!!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I have mixed feelings about the book.  The author's use of language in describing the great city of Illeus, the characters, their lifestyles, and definitely how Armado writes about human emotions such as love, and  jealousy, could not be beat!  The political plot of the book was good but the love story between Gabriella and Nacib were my favorite chapters to read in the book.  Even when Armado would just write about Gabriella it gave life again to the story and renewed interest in the book for me.  In my opinion though some of the chapters were incredibly difficult to get through.  On one hand I appreciated the character development as all of the characters involved were written with depth that made them feel real.  Armando even tells us about their pasts and how they came to live in Illeus.  On the other hand I kept mixing up the characters and their individual situation.  Also some of the chapters just didn't have enough movement for me and were redundant.  A great read but I probably would not read again."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great book!
