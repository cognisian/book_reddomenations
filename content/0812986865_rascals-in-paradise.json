It's a series of 10 historical accounts about various characters one way or another lived, ruled or would rule on various pacific islands and some of the trouble they got into die to their motives or stubbornness. The stories stretch from the 1700's to the the 1950's and we peek into peoples motives and the world they lived in and reasoning for going to these islands and the trouble it usually ended up getting them into.  We also see some of how The explorers of the 18th and 19th century affected the Native islanders and made those places very difficult to safely visit by later explorers. We see interesting aspects of foolish and lowly human nature that end up creating the circumstances they had to deal with or that ended up causing their demise. I enjoyed reading the book. It wasn't always a 'page turner' though there were some stories I didn't want to put the book down and at least one case I read the entire section in one sitting. Well written and even when you have to put the book down you are not lost when you resume reading."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

After that, the subsequent stories failed to catch my imagination at all\u2026\u2026and I gave up at 40%."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Michener's writing could always make watching grass grow an adventure, so it's no surprise that these pirates and con men make for interesting reading.
