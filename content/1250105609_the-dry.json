This story is set in Australia and the farming town is in the middle of a two year drought. I very much liked the atmospheric tone of the drought, it took on a character of its own. The story involves a current day tragedy and an unsolved death from twenty years prior. The narrative weaves well between the two stories with plenty of twists and secrets revealed.I loved the author's dedication which reads \"To my parents, Mike and Helen, who always read to me\"."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I picked this book because of its award nomination, so I had high hopes. I was not disappointed. A balanced, realistic and measured crime novel. Not violent, not rushed and not insecure in seeking to create reader adrenaline surges. Similar to Sandford's Virgil Flowers stories, but with less of the macho American syndrome. True quality crime."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I read this on vacation and it held my interest. It took place in Australia, and I enjoyed learning about that locale and the characters the author created around it. It will keep you guessing until the end!

(The only minor criticism was that all nervous people chewed on their thumbnails.)"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is the best book I've read in a long time. Very believable without all the \"twists\" that make you say yeah right ,like that's gonna happen. The characters felt real, and I liked the suspense.
