As an event coordinator myself, I was able to connect in that aspect with Blythe. Full of unique characters, their personalities and traits so real you feel for them, Bird had outdone herself with this one. The book remained strong through-out; a testimony to Sarah's writing. This is the first work I have read of Sarah Bird's, but definitely will be looking for more of her work. A real page-turner!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "came on time and in the manner described. Really enjoy S Bird's books, enjoyed this one.

Not joke-funny, but witty, cant help yourself from literally laughing out loud no matter where you are at. Find the part where an Asian school mate from a few years past talks to Blythe (main character).  The conversation written in full Asain-like accent and Blythe is trying to figure out what she is saying.  Favorite couple of sentences of the book by far!This is NOT my type of book/genre/topic at all. I stumbled across it at the library and (hate to say this) but the cover drew me in! Something about it kept me flipping page after page.  It was realistic and the main character is so outrageous and...witty!  SO glad I did stray away from my normal style book.Also would make a great vacation read that is zippy, quick, and unexpected.  Definitely worth buying!Just starting on a few other books by same author....hope she keeps this style of lightheartedness up! Need something like this right now!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Since I am a resident of a suburb of Austin, I definitely could relate to all the author wrote about and described. The characters were vivid and the humor was enjoyable!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I recently read Sarah Bird's\u00a0The Gap Year, and liked it a lot, so decided to try another one of her books. However, this one was more comedic than The Gap Year, and it just didn't click for me. I felt the characters were more one-dimensional, each designed to play a part in a morality tale, rather than feeling true to life. The lead character Blythe Young is former 'trailer trash' (character's words, not mine) who has worked her way up to the heights of 'Old Austin' society through marriage and a catering business. However, she's now divorced, and because of a series of deceptions she tried to pull off, shunned by her high society friends. She ends up bunking with her old college friend Millie, who is now a spiritual counselor of sorts. Over time, Blythe is forced to own up to her deceptions and make good, and she (and her society friends) come to realize the folly of their ways and develop more meaningful lives. I like that premise, but unfortunately, the sitcommish set of events that leads up to their transformation is just too wacky and out there for me, and I didn't develop enough of a relationship with the characters (including Blythe) to appreciate their transformation. So while I appreciate the overall spiritual message and did enjoy some of the comedy, overall this was just so-so for me. Based on The Gap Year though, I will give a couple more of Sarah Bird's books a try."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Blythe Young is in trouble. Her rich husband is gone, along with all the trappings that came along with being an Austin socialite. Her business is bust. She owes the IRS big time. She has defaulted on her student loans. Drugs are her only solace. Nowhere to run to, baby.But, then again, Blythe does have somewhere to run to. Her old friend, Millie. And Millie doesn't let her down.If you've never read a Bird, you must do it. Now. If you're not an Austinite, or at least a Texan, be prepared to enter a unique subculture. It's funny, but very, very dark. Go for it.

But when that same mother-in-law lands a better catch for her son ten years later, Blythe, now thirty-three and childless, is unceremoniously dumped. Penniless, desperate, but determined, Blythe finds herself taking refuge at Seneca House, the housing co-op where she lived a decade ago in college. There she encounters her old college roommate, the sweet Millie Ott, one of the many friends Blythe shucked off during a frenzy of social climbing.\r\n\r\nBefore long, Blythe comes face to face with her past sins and dubious moral choices, and under the unlikely tutelage of Millie, the eternal optimist, Blythe is finally able to discover the path to real happiness. Combining the wicked humor of David Sedaris with the hip, trendy style of Lauren Weisberger, this fast-paced, and sharply observed tale is a comic triumph of a novel.", "asin": "143912308X", "rank": "1652818", "city": "Austin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZDR0hjfgL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
