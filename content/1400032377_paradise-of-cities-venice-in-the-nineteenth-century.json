Sometimes we are just reading interesting things about interesting people who happen to have spent time in Venice. I don't care. The thread of the concept works; talking about Venice after the fall of its great days and the rise of Venice as a tourist attraction; the charm or Venice with it's art filled churches and myriad canals. If you like other books by John Julius Norwich you will also enjoy this one.

It's very different from his previous tomes, and the reviewers that complain about the more relaxed tone and structure of this book should have read the author's introduction, where Norwich tells a reader what to expect from the pages that follow.The book is becoming a history twice - while describing the end of republic and Napoleon's rape of Venice and later - in the chapter about the Revolution of 1848-49.  The first part is indispensable if one wants to understand how and why Venice slipped into lethargy, the second is an absolutely unmissable testimony to the Venetians' yearning for their republic's rebirth.The text about the Revolution is an insertion, yes, but without it the nineteenth century Venice would have looked just like a picturesque ruin inhabited by docile natives.The texts about Venice in XIX-XX are a delicasy for these who are already familiar with the much more researched and written about periods of La Serenissima's  life. Finishing it's story with the year 1797 is like cutting short someone's biography when and because a person grows older and becomes less entertaining.I wouldn't recommend anyone to start his or her reading about Venice with this book, but also I have no doubt that as your 15th or 30th book on the subject Paradise Of The Cities will be a delight.After introduction you can make your own...playlist of chapters, I've proceeded to the last, about \"Baron Corvo\", then skipped to Ruskin, followed with the one about Layards (just because I haven't heard of them before), enjoyed the text about Whistler and Sargent, was a bit disappointed by the pages with the story of Byron (Christopher Hibbert tells it better, I think),  it's a pleasure to zigzag through this book choosing the next chapter on a whim - something that's absolutely impossible when you read Norwich's best known history."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I have this book in hard cover but bought this inexpensive paperback to keep w/ me as I wander Venice and to mark up and take notes in w/out hesitation.
