Having read and marveled at his short stores in the past, I feel that, like John Updike, he is much more successful in the short form than in novels.

By the end i wished I had. A token twist ending without being too much of a surprise. You knew some shoe was going to drop just not which one. A wholly inlikeable narrator that breaks the fourth wall to explain how he knows private information but only when it's convenient for the author to come up with an explanation. Just another grasping, transparent novel that tries too hard to show it knows the wealthy life inside New York's literary world and those in their orbit. But the ending just for the sake of it without any real moral imperative to the plot. Ugh."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Oh yey, I thought, proper literature. Well reviewed, national bestseller, sounds great. But no. Not so much. This story of a Salingeresque writer and his family peripherally narrated by the best friend's son left a lot to be desired. It was definitely the proper literature, in fact it was tragically dramatically aware of it, with its ponderous page long sentences and overwhelming self importance. In fact, it was so busy being literature, it forgot to be a good book. You know, the sort with likeable characters and things happening and arcs and journeys and enveloping engagement for readers. All those things were either not offered at all or only sporadically and mostly buried by the oppressive general prolixity.  The actual events in the book span a brief amount of time, though described in such exhaustive detail, it becomes exhausting to read. The book took 6 years to write and what felt like years to read. It wasn't difficult to put down or something to look forward to picking back up again. I read it with mad determination of a completist, plodding through obscenely protracted sentences to get to the oases of actually enjoyable scenes. It was a task to finish, downright tedious at times. And the thing is Gilbert is obviously talented (and quite clever judging by the book's extras, it's there within the pages, however overwritten those are. Readers who are into  these sort of weighty slow family dramas and valuing language over plot might enjoy this. I'm usually really into the New York based stories, but this literati overindulgent moneyed elite just reeked of easy clich\u00e9s. This seemed like the book it may be fashionable to pretend to like instead of actually like. Either way it really didn't work for me. Not enough redeeming features to justify the time. All that time."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Hard to keep track of the characters as there are to many.  They switch from one to the next to much.

N. Dyer? & Sons is a literary masterwork for readers of The Art of Fielding, The Emperor\u2019s Children, and Wonder Boys\u2014the panoramic, deeply affecting story of an iconic novelist, two interconnected families, and the heartbreaking truths that fiction can hide.\r\n\r\nLook for special features inside. Join the Random House Reader\u2019s Circle for author chats and more.\r\n \r\nThe funeral of Charles Henry Topping on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side would have been a minor affair (his two-hundred-word obit in The New York Times notwithstanding) but for the presence of one particular mourner: the notoriously reclusive author A. N. Dyer, whose novel Ampersand stands as a classic of American teenage angst. But as Andrew Newbold Dyer delivers the eulogy for his oldest friend, he suffers a breakdown over the life he\u2019s led and the people he\u2019s hurt and the novel that will forever endure as his legacy. He must gather his three sons for the first time in many years\u2014before it\u2019s too late.\r\n \r\nSo begins a wild, transformative, heartbreaking week, as witnessed by Philip Topping, who, like his late father, finds himself caught up in the swirl of the Dyer family. First there\u2019s son Richard, a struggling screenwriter and father, returning from self-imposed exile in California. In the middle lingers Jamie, settled in Brooklyn after his twenty-year mission of making documentaries about human suffering. And last is Andy, the half brother whose mysterious birth tore the Dyers apart seventeen years ago, now in New York on spring break, determined to lose his virginity before returning to the prestigious New England boarding school that inspired Ampersand. But only when the real purpose of this reunion comes to light do these sons realize just how much is at stake, not only for their father but for themselves and three generations of their family.\r\n \r\nIn this daring feat of fiction, David Gilbert establishes himself as one of our most original, entertaining, and insightful authors. & Sons is that rarest of treasures: a startlingly imaginative novel about families and how they define us, and the choices we make when faced with our own mortality.\r\n \r\n\u201cA big, ambitious book about fathers and sons, Oedipal envy and sibling rivalry, and the dynamics between art and life . . . [& Sons] does a wonderful job of conjuring up its characters\u2019 memories . . . in layered, almost Proustian detail.\u201d The New York Times", "asin": "0812984358", "rank": "237021", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51VHCGUOpQL.jpg", "country": "Brooklyn", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
