Sometimes I really like to just pick up a book blindly, not having read the back cover or heard anything about the book. This is due in part to the fact that I judge books by their covers. So my roommate had checked this book out the last time we went to the library and it was a short graphic novel, so I figured I could read it in a short sitting. I absolutely loved it. I like how Satrapi writes, with all of her family sitting around storytelling. I\u2019ve not read Persepolis, although I watched the movie. This was a lovely trip through some family experiences related to marriage in Iran and family values, particularly how they affect women. This is a beautiful way to delve into women\u2019s rights in the Middle East from the perspective of Middle Eastern women themselves, and I really respect how many of these women have different views surrounding sex, their bodies, and men. It\u2019s a rich and full way to explore women\u2019s rights, a way that tends not to be portrayed in media because people tend to push one side or the other, women being conservative and traditional or full-out radical, but this is not reality."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I ordered this book for a friend's birthday as she is a huge fan of Marjane Satrapi.  When the book arrived I think I read it at least 3 times before gifting it to her!If you are a fan of Persepolis then you are already familiar with Satrapi's writing/drawing style.  This book is a little lighter of a read since it does not deal as much with war and politics.  This is a great gift to give to your best girl friend and then swap your own stories inspired by the ones of Marjane and her various friends and family members.  It is an amazing book, as expected."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Enjoyable read, only con is that it was over to fast, I was able to read it in one sitting, Someone hoping for something similar to Persepolis would probably be disappointed, the pacing is entirely different in Embroideries"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "amazing work from the author once again although nothing beats Persepolis."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Beautiful.
