But so many routes are closed, and so much money is needed. Then one night in Lisbon, as a poor young refugee gazes hungrily at a boat bound for America, a stranger approaches him with two tickets and a story to tell.\r\n \r\nIt is a harrowing tale of bravery and butchery, daring and death, in which the price of love is beyond measure and the legacy of evil is infinite. As the refugee listens spellbound to the desperate teller, in a matter of hours the two form a unique and unshakable bond\u2014one that will last all their lives.\r\n \r\n\u201cThe world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first rank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure.\u201d\u2014The New York Times Book Review", "asin": "0449912434", "rank": "285301", "city": "Lisbon", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41FRhmNNsML.jpg", "country": "Portugal", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
