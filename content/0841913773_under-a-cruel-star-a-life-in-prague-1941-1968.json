Kovaly was deported to concentration camps, escaped from a death march, nearly starved in the post-war years, only to be shattered by her husband's conviction (in the infamous 1952 Slansky trial) and his execution. Resonant with lyricism, this gripping memoir is uplifting even in the midst of horror.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce in a rare while we read a book that puts the urgencies of our time and ourselves in perspective, making us confront the darker realities of human nature... Mrs. Kovaly experienced the two supreme horrors of what Hannah Arendt called this terrible century. But her book is not just a personal memoir of inhumanity. In telling her story \u2013 simply, without self-pity \u2013 she illuminates some general truths of human behavior... Quietly, with cumulative force, it shows us how the totalitarian state feeds on the blindness and the weakness of man.\u201d The New York Times", "asin": "0841913773", "rank": "94225", "city": "Prague", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41XJT4KFX7L.jpg", "country": "Czechia", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
