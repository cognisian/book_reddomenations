It has stayed with me and I often think about this book.  When I finished reading it, I wanted to go around kicking things yelling \"it's not fair, it's just not fair!\"  Mistry has created characters you feel you know.  And they do live lives in a fine balance.  There is just to much injustice for everyone, so much suspicion, so much graft and greed, and all these people wanted to do was make a living, even a barely subsistence living by trusting each other together. I still feel like kicking things and yelling \"it's not fair?\" when I think of this book.  I probably will try to reread it at some point but I'm not sure I could make it through again without getting so angry I have to quit.  The bad part is that some people probably have lived like this and been unfairly messed up like this.  Makes me a little more grateful to live in a society where things like this don't happen--yet."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Superb. Masterful.
