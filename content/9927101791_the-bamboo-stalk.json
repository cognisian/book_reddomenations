Pressure from his scandalized grandmother means the maid is sent back home with her child ... but always the vague promise that he can return one day when the time is right.Brought up in poverty, with a horrible grandfather and prostitute aunt, Jose never quite knows who he is. \"I was more like a bamboo plant, which doesn't belong anywhere in particular. You can cut off a piece of the stalk and plant it without roots in any piece of ground...the stalk sprouts new roots and starts to grow again in thew new ground with no past, no memory.\"His mother doesn't press Catholicism on him, convinced he'll become a muslim one day. And then one day he gets to visit his father's homeland...A sad tale which brings out the prejudice and snobbishness of a supposedly religious country.Not the greatest literature, but quite a good read, maybe *3.5"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This book has an interesting theme of a young man trying to find his place, caught between the worlds of his mother and father. From that perspective, it was an interesting theme, especially because these two worlds were places I am less familiar with, the Philippines and Kuwait. Like a method actor, Alsanousi had to immerse himself in the culture of the country to make himself first feel all its nuances before communicating them to his readers. It was interesting to explore those cultures with him, but I felt the story would have been more poignant with a little more angst and a little less verbiage. I know this book won an International Award for Arab Literature, and as I'm not familiar with the books it was competing against, it is difficult for me to comment here. I do think Alsanousi is a talented writer, so it will be interesting to follow his career as he matures.Lois W.

I was also surprised to find that this is in fact a translation from Arabic, so full marks to Jonathan Wright, the translator.Jose's mother, Josephine, was a Philippina maid in the Al-Tarouf household in Kuwait, when she fell in love with Rashid, the wayward, only son. Rashid loved his baby son but his mother was horrified and turned him out of the house. Not surprisingly, Josephine lost her job and she and her son were deported back home.There is no news from Rashid for many years and Josephine's searches come back cold. But although Jose is raised in the Philippines, he always carries his father's promise that he will eventually return to be a son of Kuwait.The book description reveals that he does manage to return to Kuwait, as a young man, so I'm not giving away any spoilers there. What he finds though, is probably the book's strongest part - it shows how the people are not primarily Kuwaiti, nor from a particular sect or class, their strongest allegiance is to the family name and it is pride in this that rules all their actions. Nothing must bring shame on the family, and a half Philippino son is not something to be proud of.I can see why The Bamboo Stalk was winner of the 2013 International Prize for Arab Fiction - chosen both for its literary qualities and for \u201cits social and humanitarian content.\u201dIt is an excellent insight into the issues behind the phenomenon of expat workers into wealthy GCC countries.Definitely recommended."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Was highly recommended by a friend...I recommend it too!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The main character's mom leaves her homeland to work as a maid in a country with a different culture, different language.

Josephine, with all the wide-eyed naivety of youth, believes she has found true love.
