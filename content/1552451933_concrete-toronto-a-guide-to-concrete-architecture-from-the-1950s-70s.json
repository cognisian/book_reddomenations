From international landmarks to civic buildings to cultural institutions to metropolitan infrastructure and the single-family home, reminders of the era of 'brutalist' architecture surround Torontonians. But for how long? As architectural fashion has shifted to the glass-and-steel neomodernism of today, these concrete structures have been increasingly ignored \u2013 and in some cases, demolished.\r\n\r\nConcrete Toronto takes readers on a guided tour of Toronto's concrete architecture. Editors Michael McClelland and Graeme Stewart have assembled a diverse group of industry experts \u2013 architects, university faculty, local practitioners, city planners, historians and journalists \u2013 to examine the unique and important qualities and the past and future of Toronto's concrete buildings in interviews, articles, archival photos, drawings and case studies.\r\n\r\nAppealing to both the average reader and the enthusiast, Concrete Toronto provides a refreshing look not only at the neglected buildings, but also at the trends that produced them and the impact and consequences that resulted from their construction.", "asin": "1552451933", "rank": "2648336", "city": "Toronto", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WJucU5RnL.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
