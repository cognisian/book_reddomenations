We disgree with each other about the American involvement in the Vietnam war, but we both agreed that this book was the most enlightening on the Vietnamese experience from the period from the thirties to the end of the American War and a few years after.  Andrew Pham writes in the first person as his father in telling his compelling story.  In the process one sees the life and history as it unfolds during his father's life.  It was a work of literature and very absorbing to read.  Just wonderful - my husband's book group is now reading it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Another excellent, well written book by Andrew X.

As their country of invaded bt the French. Japanese, Chinese, and Americans, they move from North to South and back to the North again trying to get the best for themselves possible, while their country is being ravaged and looted by one invader after another.  Our hero learns to live with reduced expectations and in a humble manner -- a far cry from the power and luxury of his parents.  He does survive but loses almost everything of value bt the time the Americans evacuate.  This is an excellent introduction to the history of the Vietnam War, a subject still avoided in many public schools.  It is well worth the time and modest cost to read it."}]}, "authors": ["Andrew X.
