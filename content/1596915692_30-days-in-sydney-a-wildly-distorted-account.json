The book is written from Carey\u2019s perspective as an expat Australian (he now lives in New York) so it is has the detached yet attached feel of the writer both at home with his people and land and yet alienated.This perch enables Carey to visit old friends and landscapes and make new connections and interpretations about the Australian past, present and future.As a travel book in this genre, from this angle, Carey delivers what he promises as a writer."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Peter Carey, a prolific and gifted writer, has written a short, insightful book that gives the reader not only a feel for the historical city of Sydney, but a clear view of the character and grit of Australians old and new. The depiction of a rugged sailing race fraught with danger tells as much about the character of Australian men as it doescabout the dangerous sport. An excellent read."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Peter Carey's 30 Days In Sydney claims to present a wildly distorted account of a writer's return to a city he knows well. After ten years in New York, the author spends a month in the city he left behind and he records the experience. It's not at all distorted, except interestingly via an essential personal perspective. It's more than a travelogue, less than a memoir, certainly not a guidebook. The form is intriguing. It could pass as a commonplace book, the merely fleshed out notes of an individual's visit to his own past. And the form works well.The idea, it seems, is to communicate a feel for a place. The result is a collected experience where the personal rubs shoulders with the historical, where memory meets geography, where the past is partly lived again through recollection and the lives of others who themselves have moved on. And all of this takes place in less than sixty thousand words.Peter Carey's aim of using the ancient elements, fire, air, earth and water, as a thread to bind his impressions, however, simply does not work. The idea appears and then seems to be forgotten for some time. The earth is surely special in Australia, quite unlike anywhere else. And water is everywhere in Sydney, whose harbour is surely one of the world's most beautiful places. Fire certainly formed - and continues to form - this landscape: no Australian needs to be reminded of this. Air, however, did not seem to have its own angle, apart form the author having arrived by plane. Looking back now, perhaps the thread was there, despite the fact that at the time it seemed something of a complication.Themes apart, 30 Days In Sydney is a delightful read because of the characters that Peter Carey meets, depicts and describes, both the living and the dead, the contemporary and the historical. The mix is unique. The rawness is abrasive, but the sophistication alongside is always breathtaking.Sydney is the kind of city where multiple cultures coexist. In that it is not unique. But it is also the largest city of a nation that has recently rediscovered an aboriginal identity that is being apologetically sanctified. It's a city where the bar at the opera probably has a poker machine. In Manly, the multi-class seaside suburb, a beautiful person with headphones and roller blades can flash past the open door of an amusement arcade while the police swing band, live in the open air, all in uniform and wearing shades, plays a Glen Miller selection. It's a place where you can be pushed off the sidewalk by a redneck right outside the most utterly twee of art galleries. Such contrasts are all there in Peter Carey's book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great writer! It really takes me back to my childhood in Australia. I love this book. Beautiful choice of words. Interesting and humorous too."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This was a nice book to read before I left for Sydney. Gave me a bit of a different perspective than a travel guide would, while still offering plenty to explore."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Congratulations, Mr Carey, on producing the only boring book on Sydney I have ever read.  The stories you relate are, apart from the climbers dying in the Blue Mountains, mainly boring.  You do not capture, in my opinion, the essence of Sydney.  Your book is essentially about a group of your closest friends, who, frankly, could be living in any city in the world.  I am not interested in what your mate thinks of Parramatta bleedin road?  It may have had some historical significance in the 19th Century, but its just a road now, which leads through some pretty decrepit suburbs.  I expected some really penetrating anecdotes about Sydney and Sydneysiders (I was one of them, having grown up on the North Shore).  As for your politics - why oh why oh why do you liberals think that ordinary folk in the street should apologise for atrocities committed against the Aborigines?  You are just another one of the `sorry' brigade, which gets a kick out of seeing young white children paint the word `sorry' on their foreheads.  Disgusting.  Mr Carey (and please stay in New York), there is no such thing as Inherited Guilt.  You should never apologise, or force other people to apologise, for something you haven't done.I will, however, give you plaudits for reciting the story of Mr Eternity.  But Mr Eternity was a quintessentially Australian character, Mr Carey; you are not.Enjoy the Big Apple!P.S. This book is now out of print and deserves its long-awaited oblivion."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Any attempt to girdle a city within literature is doomed by the complexity and expanse of the topic.  Carey delays this admission until the end, although by then his feelings are clear.  Living and writing in New York City, only a deep inland residence could give him greater setting for contrast.  His comparison with his current home is limited to the cramped quarters he endures there.  Yet this limited contrast imparts the theme and import of this personal summary.  Little of this book is about Australia's key city.  Instead, the majority of Carey's essays here describe the Harbour, the Blue Mountains, the Pacific Coast, the Bridge and rivers.  The characters are a melange of his personal friends and historical figures.  There is a mystical episode on the Harbour Bridge and a passing critique of the CBD [Central Business District] and the values of those working there.  The theme remains that the City is but one location in a region of contrasts.  No other city is placed so uniquely.  Perhaps no-one is better suited to attempt this unique task.Many cities rejoice in their history, but in this, too, Sydney is special.  Founded as a convict colony, it grew into a major Pacific port.  Survival was a struggle with poor soil, vagaries of rain and wind and the presence of the Aborigine population - issues that urbanisation hides but cannot eliminate.  Sensing its importance early, Sydney girted the Harbour with forts, something Carey lightly applauds when old forts become new parks.  Carey conveys the sense of struggle, but time has transformed equal starving of convicts and guards to ideals of social equality - so long as that society is white, he reminds us.  His \"distorted view\" imparts his dissenting view on relations with displaced Aborigines, among other topics.However booksellers classify this work, it's not a travel advisory.  Tourists will be unlikely to join the Sydney to Hobart race.  Even more unlikely when they read Carey's account of the disaster of 1998.  Nor will the casual visitor find themselves in a capsized racing skiff in the teeth of ten metre waves and forty knot winds.  If you do visit, be careful hiking in mountains.  If your visit occurs in the Southern Hemispheric summer, be extra cautious with matches or campfires.  What can happen if you aren't Carey imparts with stunning clarity.  Having lost his own house to fire, a telephone dialogue with a friend fighting to save one is a gripping read.Carey's many awards are well deserved.  His descriptive writing skills and characterisation are well demonstrated in this book.  It's no matter if these are real people, mixtures of many into one or wholly invented.  Their own stories are from real life and deserve attention.  Carey snags your attention from the first page and you give it willingly to the rest of the book.  An essay string that may be enjoyed by anyone, this book provides entertainment, education and excitement.  Try it and see.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Peter Carey spent 30 days in Sydney in 2000 and we readers are the lucky recipients of his account. He clearly loves Sydney and demonstrates this love in every page of this little volume. His love is contagious. For example, on viewing what he calls \"the great Pacific Ocean,\" he writes: \"It is one of a hundred places you will find in Sydney which take your breath away, and I, familiar but disoriented, was in a state of constant amazement that any metropolis could be so blesssed.\" He also obviously cares deeply for his friends who still live there. About his friend Jack Ledoux he says: \"I have lived in more than one house Jack has designed and would be a happy man if I could wake up in one tomorrow morning and live in it all my life. Every time I walk into one of his constructions, it makes me happy.\" What an extraordinary way to describe a friend! Mr. Carey sets out to describe this great city in terms of earth, air, fire and water. He does this by having several zany friends of his-- some of them friends of thirty years-- tell their stories. Any one of these characters ought to be found in a novel, at least one of Mr. Carey's. In his hands they become flesh and blood and as interesting as the city they describe. Good stuff jumps out on every page. Mr. Carey admits that he cannot drive over Sydney's famous bridge without having a panic attack, a fact that is particularly significant to me since I suffer from the same problem with high bridges. Then there is the delicious account of the word \"Eternity\" and the little man responsible for writing the word everywhere or anywhere he felt his God called him to write it. Carey's handling of the \"Aborigine problem\" is particularly poignant in his discussion of Vicki, who was taken from her parents and raised by a white family.Carey, now living in New York, did not move to Sydney, the city his mother said was just like Liberace, until he was almost forty-- \". . . even then I carried in my baggage a typical Melbournian distrust of that vulgar crooked convict town.\"  I for one would love to see him write similar books about both Melbourne and New York.So much good writing-- so many marvelous stories in 248 pages. A great read!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This is a good read for Aussie expats, not least because the author is one of Australia\ufffds more prominent contemporary literary figures, staging a return visit to Sydney from his current home in New York.
