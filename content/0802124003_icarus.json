The fifth pulse-pounder starring Captain Benny Griessel, a lead detective in South Africa\u2019s priority crimes unit, delves into the country\u2019s burgeoning tech and wine industries.\r\n\r\nA week before Christmas, a young photographer discovers a plastic-wrapped corpse amidst the sand dunes north of Cape Town. The only thing found on the corpse is a dead iPhone, but it doesn\u2019t take long for the police to identify the body as that of Ernst Richter\u2014the tech whiz behind MyAlibi, an internet service that provides unfaithful partners with sophisticated cover stories to hide an affair. Meanwhile, Benny Griessel is called to the scene of a multiple homicide involving a former colleague, and four years of sobriety are undone on the spot. He emerges from his drunken haze determined to quit the force, but the take-no-sass Major Mbali Kaleni, now his boss, wants Griessel on the Richter case. The high-profile murder has already been the subject of fierce media speculation, with questions swirling about the potential for motive: could the perpetrator be one of the countless jilted spouses? An aggrieved client?\r\n\r\nBefore the week is out, an unexpected connection to a storied family winery comes to light, and Griessel\u2019s reputation is again on the line. Mounting towards a startling conclusion, Icarus is another exceptional novel from the \u201cKing of South African Crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSouth African author Deon Meyer\u2019s Benny Griessel series is one of the high points of contemporary crime fiction, and the fifth title, Icarus, is his best yet . . .
