At first the somewhat manic tone of one of the main characters resulted in my putting it down. But I picked it up, and I am glad I did. Great humor and absolutely intriguing structure. With the laughs come a real and unique invitation to think about identity, personality, and individual development. Bravo."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Following Mr. Poitier thru his exploits was a journey in humor and frivolity. The unusual nature of this books narrative had me expecting a much deeper plot that never materialized (or maybe I was just too shallow to catch it). Still, the winding path of the protagonist remained enjoyable, humorous and unpredictable.

I accepted, then and there, my place in the world. I was a fighter of windmills. I was a chaser of whales. I was Not Sidney Poitier.\r\n\r\nNot Sidney Poitier is an amiable young man in an absurd country. The sudden death of his mother orphans him at age eleven, leaving him with an unfortunate name, an uncanny resemblance to the famous actor, and, perhaps more fortunate, a staggering number of shares in the Turner Broadcasting Corporation.\r\n\r\nPercival Everett's hilarious new novel follows Not Sidney's tumultuous life, as the social hierarchy scrambles to balance his skin color with his fabulous wealth. Maturing under the less-than watchful eye of his adopted foster father, Ted Turner, Not gets arrested in rural Georgia for driving while black, sparks a dinnertable explosion at the home of his manipulative girlfriend, and sleuths a murder case in Smut Eye, Alabama, all while navigating the recurrent communication problem: \"What's your name?\" a kid would ask. \"Not Sidney,\" I would say. \"Okay, then what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\u201cPercival Everett has made a career out of flouting expectations . . . [forging] a nervy, caustic body of work that defies easy categorization.\u201d Los Angeles Times", "asin": "1555975275", "rank": "174001", "city": "Los Angeles", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41upiwOBR4L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
