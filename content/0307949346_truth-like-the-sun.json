I enjoyed the historical story line about the 1962 world's fair and what it took to get it launched.  I was not aware of the city corruption levels that existed at the time so that was very illuminating. I wish the lead characters were a bit younger and felt some of  the emphasis on old age facilities to be more dated rather than many of the current level of options available to seniors today.

Helen Gulanos, a reporter every bit as eager to make her mark, sees her assignment to investigate the events of 1962 become front-page news with Morgan's candidacy, and resolves to find out who he really is and where his power comes from: in 1962, a brash and excitable young promoter, greeting everyone from Elvis Presley to Lyndon Johnson, smooth-talking himself out of difficult situations, dipping in and out of secret card games; now, a beloved public figure with, it turns out, still-plentiful secrets. \r\n\r\nWonderfully interwoven into this tale of the city of dreams are backroom deals, idealism and pragmatism, the best and worst ambitions, and all the aspirations that shape our communities and our lives.\r\n\r\n\u201cA flat-out great read with the spirit of a propulsive, character-driven 1970s movie\u2026. Mr. Lynch pairs unlikely antagonists: an old-school political fixer blessed with immense charm, and an overeager newspaperwoman whose research, done in 2001, has the power to destroy him. They never behave predictably, and their showdown lingers long after Mr. Lynch\u2019s story is over.\u201d The New York Times", "asin": "0307949346", "rank": "559219", "city": "Seattle", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51COWmn2p7L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
