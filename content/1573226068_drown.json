Rather, he would prefer to unravel the molecular structure of life itself, and as a result joins up with the titular character on a journey to meet other strange and interesting characters. This is a classic travel book, not of landscapes butt of the oddities and permutations of the human animal. Powell's sense of expression and style are always pricking to the ear to keep almost every moment chugging forward. The final chapters slog a bit in trying to wrap everything up a little too neatly, but overall a worthy read."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "great book, well written, shows the reality of Latinos living in the US without romanticizing their lives, and without criticizing them"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Diaz is a Dominican treasure. Such relatable stories that speak to me."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is an extraordinary collection by an extraordinary writer, about young Dominican men drowning in an over masculinized society. My four favorites are \"Ysrael,\" \"Drown,\" \"Edison, New Jersey,\" and \"Negocios.\" They are woven together with Joycean delight in the language: \"Pato\" is the Dominican slang for \"gay man\" and means (literally) \"duck.\" Watch the mother duck swim by in the first page of \"Edison . . .\" and defuse the term for that tale by providing a model for a mother feeding and leading her ducklings. The writing is beautiful and vigorous.

Places and voices new to our literature yet classically American: coming-of-age stories full of wild humor, intelligence, rage, and piercing tenderness. And this is just the beginning. Diaz is going to be a giant of American prose. --Francisco Goldman\r\n\r\nEver since Diaz began publishing short stories in venues as prestigious as The New Yorker, he has been touted as a major new talent, and his debut collection affirms this claim. Born and raised in Santo Domingo, Diaz uses the contrast between his island homeland and life in New York City and New Jersey as a fulcrum for his trenchant tales. His young male narrators are teetering into precarious adolescence. For these sons of harsh or absent fathers and bone-weary, stoic mothers, life is an unrelenting hustle. In Santo Domingo, they are sent to stay with relatives when the food runs out at home; in the States, shoplifting and drugdealing supply material necessities and a bit of a thrill in an otherwise exhausting and frustrating existence. There is little affection, sex is destructive, conversation strained, and even the brilliant beauty of a sunset is tainted, its colors the product of pollutants. Keep your eye on Diaz; his first novel is on the way.", "asin": "1573226068", "rank": "19807", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GN%2Bi49PLL.jpg", "country": "Santo Domingo", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
