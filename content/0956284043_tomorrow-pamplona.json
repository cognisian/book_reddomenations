The language is not exquisite, but overly pedantic, containing much that does nothing to propel the plot or dialogue--the book could have been much shorter without useless statements such as: \"He blinks\".  On the one hand, overtly flowery language is a hindrance if the writer has nothing compelling to say, but on the other, it can also be too banal--which it is in the case of this book.  The writer stretched out the plot in a nice fashion, keeping you guessing as to the motive for the boxer's (Danny's) flight to Pamplona, but it was painful to get there.  The Robert character is cardboard stiff and uninteresting--the most interesting passages are those of Danny's recollection of his dealings with his trainer and promoter, and with the love interest. There is nothing to believe in any connection between Robert and Danny, nor Danny's sense of obligation to Robert.  There is also very little development of characters as a whole that surround the main character.This series is a wonderful idea, and beautifully produced, but either the translations are too simplistic and un-evocative of the writers' own languages, or the writers themselves have been ill-advisedly chosen for this series.A big disappointment for me, though I had much hope."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This new series of short paperbacks from Peirene publishers are beautifully produced and reasonably priced. They give English readers the opportunity to sample contemporary European writers via excellent translations.I started with Tomorrow Pamplona, a dark brooding thriller. The language is exquisite and the plot sucks you in and propells you forward to the climax at the end.
