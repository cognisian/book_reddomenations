That was on full display in his ABC program This Week with David Brinkley in the 1980s and 1990s.  Not surprisingly, Washington Goes to War is loaded with sarcasm and irony, humorous anecdotes involving some of Brinkley\u2019s favorite targets in the world of WWII Washington, such as Washington socialites, Dixiecrat politicians, conservatives, isolationists, lackadaisical civil servants, to name a few.For example, Brinkley found the thinking of Washington socialites baffling:  \u201cWhy such frenzy to fill the dinner table with people who might be famous but might also be insufferably dull?  Archduke Otto of Austria, the pretender to the nonexistent Austro-Hungarian throne of the Hapsburgs, continued to be sought after even when he was found to be a bore who ate like a timber wolf and then sat lumpishly and groggily in the living room refusing to leave until pushed.  Why did the hostesses pursue this?\u201dBrinkley makes it clear from the start that he is aware of his limitations as a journalist writing history, that is, that he is not a scholarly historian.  This allows him to dispense with an index.  Likewise, he identifies his sources in a bunch at the end of the book, while not employing footnotes.His book is a fast, smooth, engaging read.  He creates a sharp sense of time and place through the inclusion of specific details about the clothing, diet, advertisements, housing, amusements, mores, and the like, that typified 1940-1945 Washington.  He does not ignore such tough issues of the day as racism, sexism, and cronyism.  He spends a lot of time on his well-rounded portrait of FDR, of whom Brinkley seems to have been enamored."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "What we all only thought we new at that time.
