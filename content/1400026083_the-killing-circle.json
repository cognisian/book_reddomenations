I like to \"love a book and this didn't make the grade. Sorry"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Patrick Rush is a single father who was recently demoted at his newspaper job from well-respected book reviewer to writer of a frivolous column called \"The Couch Potato,\" all about painfully inane reality TV shows with exclamatory names like, Falling From Buildings! and Animals That Kill!Miserable at work, and grieving the still-fresh death of his wife, he decides it's time he look into pursuing one of the goals of his youth -- writing a novel.  To that end, he joins a writing group he sees advertised in the local paper.  Each group member spends a week writing something -- anything -- and then they meet to read their work aloud and get feedback from the others.  After a few weeks spent struggling to get even the most banal prose down on paper, though, Patrick decides his life just hasn't been interesting enough. He has nothing to say, because nothing has ever happened to him.  The old adage \"write what you know\" only works if you know something, he decides.Thankfully, nobody else in the group is producing anything good either, so Patrick continues to coast through each meeting, mostly hanging around out of curiosity for his fellow failed would-bes.Then he hears chapter one of Angela's story, and everything begins to shift.Angela is a young, pretty woman whose story is strange, scary, and engrossing.  It's about a little girl stalked by a killer she describes only as \"a terrible man who does terrible things,\" and later dubs \"the Sandman.\"  As Angela tells more and more of the tale, Patrick notices  parallels between what she's writing and recent crimes reported in the news.  Just as he's begun to suspect her story is more autobiographical than fictitious, members of the group start disappearing -- some found dead, others simply vanishing into thin air.  Patrick, obsessed with both Angela and the Sandman, becomes convinced one of the group's members, a big, ugly guy who writes disturbing stories about killing animals, is the Sandman, and when someone starts following him and then Angela herself disappears, Patrick realizes his life has not only gotten interesting enough to turn into a book, the book it's turned into is \"a bloody page-turner.\"This is a pretty entertaining little thriller, with an interesting running theme about the nature of stories and storytelling.  By the end of the novel, it's hard to tell how much of the story we're hearing, narrated by Patrick, is actually true, and how much is simply a fictionalized version of his life -- not necessarily fictionalized on purpose.  This is a common issue with memoirs, after all; no memoir is ever pure truth, right?  Can we ever look at our life objectively enough to report only facts?  And, maybe more importantly, should we even try?The writing here isn't anything special -- it's well-enough crafted but not stand-out -  but the story was suspenseful enough to make me want to look for more by the author. Definitely recommended if you're in the mood for a dark little mystery."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Writing professors, almost unanimously, counsel their writing students to avoid \"writing about writing\" as \"writers writing about writing\" can be, well, less-than-compelling to readers who don't (necessarily) write. I brought all of this academic baggage to \"The Killing Circle,\" but enjoyed it nonetheless. It's schticky, but atmospheric and, you know what? I'm a writer who sometimes likes to read about how other writers navigate the writing life. (Even if those writers are fictitious characters in books by writers I admire.) I'm a huge fan of mysteries, thrillers, and Toronto, so this novel was a triple-word-score for me (having attended a fiction workshop, myself, years ago at Humber College in Toronto(-ish)).Back in March, I attended Andrew Pyper's last reading in the \"Literature for Our Time\" Series at The University of Toronto. I had recently read \"Lost Girls\" and was then looking forward to reading \"The Killing Circle.\" His advice to all of the aspiring writers in the audience was something along the lines of: \"Be the author of your life rather than the actor in the play about your life that is being directed by someone else.\" (He conveyed this with far fewer words, however.)In retrospect, this was some good advice for writers from an author who has successfully published a tricky (yet highly compelling) novel about a writer caught somewhere between fact and fiction."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "The reviewer of this book for the Richmond Times-Dispatch (see back-cover blurb) was of the view that TKC is \"head and shoulders above most thrillers out there now.\"  Assuming this reviewer's assessment is an honest one, formed on the basis of his own comparative reading of \"most thrillers out there now\", then I can only imagine that most thrillers out there now are truly awful, and extend my sympathies to all the professional book reviewers whose unhappy job it is to slog through them.  To highlight the best things about TKC: the writing is decent in a creative writing class sort of way and it's a very fast read.  To highlight the bad: the story is mediocre in the extreme.  Its shocks are all predictably unpredictable.  You might not know exactly whodunnit it from the outset, nor exactly how the story will resolve in the end (or rather -- naturally -- not resolve), but by the time you get there you'll pretty much have run through all the possibilities (there aren't that many).  And along the way, you'll be served up a hash of writer/protagonist-going-mad musings, horrific (though for the most part under-described) set pieces, black sedans and/or vans trailing at a distance, ghostly apparitions, shadowy figures, faceless persons (presumably all one and the same), all with a jagged glass of things-you-fear-the-most (cue to reader: you are supposed to bring your own worst fears to your reading of TKC; for my part, I couldn't be bothered).  TKC grinds endlessly -- albeit, thankfully, quickly -- to a lame conclusion.  It is paint-by-numbers from start to finish.  If it really is \"head and shoulders above most thrillers out there now\", then I know exactly what genre I'll be steering clear of in the future."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The Killing Circle was an exciting, gripping thriller. Pyper keeps the reader hooked, needing to know what will happen next, and while I tried to guess as to where the story was going, I always got it wrong. I love books like that."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Pyper is an immensely talented writer, as evidenced in The Wildfire Season, a master of the dark, haunting rhythms that draw characters into a netherworld of secrets and shameful deeds. Reeling after the death of his wife a few months after the birth of their son, Patrick Rush seeks a distraction from his grief and a downward-spiraling job at a local Toronto newspaper. Once the paper's book critic, Rush is being gradually demoted, barely clinging to a profession in the throes of technical revolution and downsizing. Thinking to discover his novel-in-waiting, or at least some inspiration in an otherwise difficult life, Rush answers an ad for membership in a limited writing circle. Strangers all, the group is chaired by a controversial novelist with plans for weekly meetings and discussion of each session's work.At best, the quirky figures in the group are talented, although one, a giant man who reeks of menace, offers only tales of escalating violence (\"blood tattooed on the curtains\"). But Patrick is most caught up in Angela Whitmore's unfolding story of The Sandman, \"a terrible man who does terrible things\". Drawn into Angela's scenario, Rush is further distraught by a series of violent murders occurring in his neighborhood. Obviously a serial killer is on the loose, eerily similar to Angela's Sandman. In a juxtaposition of fact and fiction, Patrick is immersed in a nightmare as, one by one, members of the writing circle die and even his beloved son, Sam, is kidnapped. Followed by an ominous stranger, Patrick is trapped in a world of real danger and increasing paranoia, finally learning the consequences of his own pretensions.Is this a ghost story? Maybe. At least Patrick embraces that concept when he uses his experience in the circle as a bridge to fame. But as the story evolves, it is clear that Rush is no innocent, no stranger to self-deception. Yet even more troubling is Pyper's attempt, as a writer, to construct a novel about writers, a lumpy porridge that is less than satisfying, if an interesting plot contrivance. Pyper fails to exercise sufficient discipline. More than the writer-on-writers angel, I had trouble with motive. For all the ghastly, confusing events that happen, I cannot identify a logical motive. There are murders, threats, creeping fears and untrustworthy characters, but to what purpose? Making matters worse, Pyper handles a cloudy resolution with a question to the \"Dear Reader\". I know Pyper is an enormously gifted storyteller; I just don't think this novel fulfills his purpose.

Before they can settle down with their food and enjoy the movie however, Sam goes missing. It's the Sandman.This beginning to the book ties you in as you have a name of the person you are looking for. Who is this \"Sandman\"? Why does he want Sam? How does Patrick know it's the \"Sandman\"?We then get taken back to 4 years before and how it all began. Patrick, failed writer, joins a writing group known as the \"Kensington Circle\". It's a small group of wanna-be writers and none of them really holds his attention. Except for one. Angela. A shy, quiet woman who shares a haunting story called \"The Sandman\". Patrick is so mesmerized by her story he secretly records it.Patrick isn't the only one taken by the story, everyone in the group is enthralled. Then it so happens a serial killer emerges on the streets of Toronto, re-enacting the same scenes from Angela's story, Patrick (and other members of the group) is worried that there might be a serial killer in the writing group. However, once the group stops meeting, the killings stop.That is until somehow \"The Sandman\" story gets published and the killings start again. I don't want to give away too much of this book, as there are many twists and turns that will constantly keep you at the edge of your seat.This book is a gem. It has been a while that I have wanted to put everything on hold just to sit and read through the day.

Authentic and imaginative."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The Killing Circle by Andrew Pyper is a great book.  I am lucky to have stumbled across this book at the store because it is well worth the money and time.  The engaging and entertaining plot is one of the best that I have read in quite a while.  Pyper installs a sense of creepiness throughout the story . . . it kept me reading on to find out what in the world was going on.  I felt that Pyper was very accurate in delivering a psychological toll that the main character would be going through with an intense story such as this.  This book is for anyone who enjoys reading dark mystery/suspense.

acclaimed, bestselling author Andrew Pyper, a suspenseful page-turner that explores the repercussions of that most dishonest of thefts: stealing another\u2019s story and calling it your

His goal: to write the book he\u2019s always felt lived within him. Trouble is, Patrick has no story to tell. And while the circle\u2019s members show similarly little literary promise, there is one exception: Angela. Her unsettling readings tell of a shadowy childhood tragedy and an unremitting fear of the Sandman, a \u201cterrible man who does terrible things.\u201d It\u2019s the stuff of nightmares or horror films. Or is it? \r\n\r\nOver the weeks that follow, a string of unsolved murders seem increasingly connected to Patrick. And then the circle\u2019s members start to go missing, one by one. Still haunted by loss\u2013and by a crime only those in the circle could know of\u2013Patrick finds himself in a fictional world made horrifically real.
