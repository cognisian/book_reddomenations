Burr's most adversarial long time political relationship was not Hamilton, but with Thomas Jefferson!  After the big duel one might think Burr would hang low and make a quiet exit.  Instead he gets involved in various unsavory political schemes and Jefferson becomes obsessed with prosecuting Burr for treason.  Burr, however is acquitted.  I had some difficulty keeping some of the minor characters straight and I felt some of the overemphasis on some of the founding father's physical characteristics (i.e. George Washington's big butt) was petty.  Perhaps this was an accurate reflection of Burr and less the author.  A great read after Chernow's \"Hamilton.\""}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Love Gore Vidal's novels."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "For those that like history and historical novels there is no better reads in American literature than the creations of Gore Vidal.

I bought it for my book club and am fascinated to know more about Aaron Burr. Knowing him as the man who fought a duel and killed Alexander Hamilton is obviously not all there is to know. The book gives a wonderful history and also adds a lot of fictional characters  mixed in with historical characters. Burr is a story telling book and about the life that Burr wants people to know about him. The book has made me want to read more history. Next up- Hamilton!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Gore Vidal's \"Burr\" is everything an historical novel should be, and more. Aaron Burr, along with Benedict Arnold, were America's original bad boys. Vidal's novel goes a long way in humanizing Burr, but does not necessarily minimize his notoriety. Rather, Vidal's novel reflects a plausible portrait of the only vice-president to literally get away with murder.Vidal does equally well personifying Burr's contemporaries. Despite our lionized perception of giants such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, these men were human and, therefore, necessarily were not perfect. We are presented these heroes with blemishes and all, literally down to the carbuncles on Washington's backside.Nor, in all likelihood, were bad boys completely despicable. Burr was a scoundrel, but a somewhat charming one at that.  In Vidal's novel we discover an affable Burr who remains scheming but amiable to the end of his long life.A particular strength of \"Burr\" is the construct of the narrative. Vidal moves seamlessly back and forth from the turbulent Revolutionary years of our Republic through the Jacksonian era. The former is captured in the oral and written memoirs of Colonel Burr, the later in the story of Charlie Schuyler, a fictional prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Burr who is writing an authorized biography of the notorious celebrity.The depth of Vidal's research is not lost on the reader.  Even when he segues into fiction, Vidal remains true to the gossip of the day.  A central theme in the novel is  Schuyler's attempt to track down juicy tidbits about the unsubstantiated rumor that Martin Van Buren was Burr's illegitimate son. The novel ends with a surprising variation on this theme.Particularly interesting is Vidal's presentation of how Burr viewed his infamous duel with Alexander Hamilton.  Surprisingly, Hamilton is not demonized by Burr nearly so much as is Jefferson. The author of the Declaration of Independence is portrayed as the shrewd and hypocritical politician that he probably was, albeit not to the level of odiousness portrayed by his own vice-president.\"Burr\" is the earliest in a series of historical novels that feature various luminaries and periods of American history. This novel may well entice you to read the others, as it has done so for me."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "this is a most rewarding and insightful view of the birth of our country.

In 1804, while serving as vice president, Aaron Burr fought a duel with his political nemesis, Alexander Hamilton, and killed him. In 1807, he was arrested, tried, and acquitted of treason. In 1833, Burr is newly married, an aging statesman considered a monster by many. But he is determined to tell his own story, and he chooses to confide in a young New York City journalist named Charles Schermerhorn Schuyler. Together, they explore both Burr's past\u2014and the continuing civic drama of their young nation.\r\n\r\nBurr is the first novel in Gore Vidal's Narratives of Empire series, which spans the history of the United States from the Revolution to post-World War II. With their broad canvas and sprawling cast of fictional and historical characters, these novels present a panorama of American politics and imperialism, as interpreted by one of our most incisive and ironic observers.", "asin": "B000JCOFR8", "rank": "3286315", "city": "New York", "image": "", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
