Club Best Book of 2013\r\n\r\nEach day before work Mar\u00eda Dolz stops at the same caf\u00e9. There she finds herself drawn to a couple who is also there every morning. Observing their seemingly perfect life helps her escape the listlessness of her own. But when the man is brutally murdered and Mar\u00eda approaches the widow to offer her condolences, what began as mere observation turns into an increasingly complicated entanglement. Invited into the widow's home, she meets--and falls in love with--a man who sheds disturbing new light on the crime. \r\n\r\nAs Mar\u00eda recounts this story, we are given a murder mystery brilliantly encased in a metaphysical enquiry, a novel that grapples with questions of love and death, chance and coincidence, and above all, with the slippery essence of the truth and how it is told.", "asin": "0307950735", "rank": "345750", "city": "Madrid", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/414H-Oil67L.jpg", "country": "Spain", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
