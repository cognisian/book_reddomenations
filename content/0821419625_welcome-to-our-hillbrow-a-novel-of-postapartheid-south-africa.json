It's a short book, but I was rather glad to have done with it. The nexus of the plot was the complex of romance and sexual relationships, a situation that more often than not I find less than entrancing. However, given that AIDS is a major factor in the novel, it was understandable that the author would see fit to do this.The book's aspect of excellence is, in my view, the picture it gives of (nearly) contemporary South Africa. Hillbrow is a section of Johannesburg (Joberg, which has become Jozi) that was once a genteel neighborhood, became nonconformist and finally rough. Very rough: it is the crime center of Jozi, which has in turn become the southern pole of Africa's economy, drawing migrants from all over sub-Saharan Africa, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and elsewhere. So the migration that has been characteristic of South Africa for more than a lifetime has changed; it was earlier characterized by long term European migration, the ancient Bantu migration, and, latterly, the movement of villagers from black South Africa to work menial jobs for whites. Now it is a global-economy migratory culture, specializing in Africa, which is a rough place.The natives don't like it. \"Natives\" means black South Africans. Whites scarcely figure at all in this novel, except when one of the protagonists goes to Oxford. A large part of the problematic in this book is the African migration to Jozi, and the natives' not altogether justifiable dislike of it. Not justifiable because they apply moral values that are not instanced by black South Africans either. The South African village has been decaying for a long time, and has tended to retain not its ancient virtues, but its ancient vices, among them most notably intense envy and belief in witchcraft. The young protagonists, doing the best they can to fit into the modern world as academics, remain tied to their ancestral villages by these old vices.There is a certain magical realism element in the novel, in that first protagonist is dead, and is being addressed by an otherwise unidentified and unlocated individual. Moreover, discussions take place in heaven among the dead characters. An interesting device, but not completely successful, in my view.So, as I see it, \"Welcome to our Hillbrow\" didn't come off quite, novelistically, but it remained readable. Its virtue is that it depicts the state of despair in which a large part of the South African population lives. It seems that despair, and fear, are the concomitants of South African life."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It's an interesting book if one wants to examine the lives of Black South Africans living in a big city after the apartheid. Most of the the people in these neighborhoods have moved from countryside and live in a separate world from White South Africans. The unique thing about this book is that it doesn't deal with White vs Black issues, but its main focus is the attitude and prejudices of Black South Africans toward other Black South Africans and immigrants from other African countries. Interestingly, the rural people feel like Blacks in a city like Johannesburg are dirty, with low morals, and no good can come from associating with them. Their views on Immigrant African are even worse. The epidemic of AIDS is understood in the light of these views--it is believed that it was brought by Black African immigrants from countries like Nigeria."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Mpe's novel is a sobering look at the intersections of social, political, cultural, and racial divides that characterize transitional South Africa.

However I was pleasantly surprised to find myself not just able to get through it, but actually enjoying it.Phaswane Mpe is a phenomenal writer, who developed deep, complex characters and truly embodied the state of mind that is xenophobia. The story he created will capture you and yourcuriosity of the unknown; and if you do know a lot about Africa and xenophobia, it will still pull you in with its relatability and a fantastic storyline.This book is thought provoking, engaging, sad, and at times, amusing.

It spills out the guts of Hillbrow\u2014living with the same energy and intimate knowledge with which the Drum writers wrote Sophiatown into being.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn his 2001 novel, Welcome to Our Hillbrow, Mpe captured the dislocation and despair of people who moved in the late \u201990s from rural South Africa to Hillbrow, a rough neighborhood in downtown Johannesburg with overcrowded high-rises and a large population of immigrants from elsewhere in Africa. In the South African literary imagination, Hillbrow has come to represent everything frightening and promising about the new South Africa; it is at once a scene of drugs, crime and xenophobia toward immigrants and also what theorists enthusiastically call \u2018Afropolitan,\u2019 a space that transcends national boundaries.\u201d New York Times", "asin": "0821419625", "rank": "201811", "city": "Johannesburg", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41-xkILI0kL.jpg", "country": "RSA", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
