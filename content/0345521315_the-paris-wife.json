It was good to read a perspective on Hemingway & his first significant marriage from the Hadley perspective. Better still a sympathetic and resistant to misandry one which many a female author might find hard to resist. Hadley, I  think, enjoyed her life - if this book is any to judge such from - more than Hemingway seems to have,  for all his celebrity and fortune. My problem, I  suppose,  was that I knew too much of the story. Hence the 3+ stars. Recommended."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Beautifully researched and written, this latest antidote to the myth of hard-drinking, fist-fighting, high-living Papa Hemingway is a welcome addition to the speculative cannon. Drinking, fighting and excesses of all kinds there were aplenty and Paula McClain brings each scene to life with striking immediacy and sometimes bloody detail. But Hemingway\u2019s emotional and physical upheavals as witnessed by his first wife, the recreated Hadley Richardson Hemingway, also include uncontrolled weeping, what we might call early-onset suicidal depression and passive, almost feminine sexual intercourse on Papa\u2019s part. Of equal interest, though no secret among chroniclers of the so-called Lost Generation, McClain\u2019s account of the creation of successive drafts of Hemingway\u2019s breakout novel, The Sun Also Rises, came as a surprise to this reader. Hemingway\u2019s first draft consists of a narrative of actual events that take place during the Festival of San Fermin in Pamplona, Spain, in which the real names of Hemingway\u2019s companions appear. He was later wise enough to rename, for instance, Lady Duff Twysden as \u201cLady Brett,\u201d himself the American journalist as \u201cJake Barnes\u201d and so on. More important, however, despite Hemingway\u2019s decision to exclude his wife from his own novel\u2019s narrative, this roman a clef is a highly effective portrait of an incident-filled marriage from dreamy, drawn-out beginnings to its on-the-rocks, adulterous end. A must-read for fans of the period."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Interesting story...

Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile group\u2014the fabled \u201cLost Generation\u201d\u2014that includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott Fitzgerald.\r\n \r\nThough deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill prepared for the hard-drinking, fast-living, and free-loving life of Jazz Age Paris. As Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history and pours himself into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises, Hadley strives to hold on to her sense of self as her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging. Eventually they find themselves facing the ultimate crisis of their marriage\u2014a deception that will lead to the unraveling of everything they\u2019ve fought so hard for.\r\n \r\nA heartbreaking portrayal of love and torn loyalty, The Paris Wife is all the more poignant because we know that, in the end, Hemingway wrote that he would rather have died than fallen in love with anyone but Hadley.\r\n \r\nNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER", "asin": "0345521315", "rank": "18049", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51m40jZ%2BiXL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
