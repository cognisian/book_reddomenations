As these seemingly unrelated events begin to unfold, Villani finds himself immersed in an unfamiliar world of political scandal and ethical ambiguity. He must navigate the inept bureaucracy that is the police department, all the while maintaining a solid front and trying to keep the press, his family, and his own past from breaking him completely. With each twist and every turn of this taut crime novel, Villani is forced to question whom he can trust.\r\n\r\nWhile The Broken Shore captured the harshness and beauty of regional Australia, Truth captures the grim reality of the city and the people who struggle to hold on to any certainty that they can find. Tense and unrelenting, this unforgettable novel confronts the complexity of human relationships and the difficulty of escaping the past.\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving read the new novels of Michael Connelly and Martin Cruz Smith, I have to say that Temple belongs in their company.\u201d The Washington Post", "asin": "B003KVKQ9G", "rank": "366540", "city": "Melbourne", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/414GWWWZhdL.jpg", "country": "Australia", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
