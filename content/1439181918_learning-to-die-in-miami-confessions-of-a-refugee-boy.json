His memory of his childhood and Cuba's transformation into a communist state was astnoishing considering how young he was.This follow-up, which picks up immediately after the first book leaves off, is very different. His memory is still powerful, but his fondness for his homeland and sweet memories of his family are replaced by his struggles to adapt to American life, being bounced from home to home, his strained family relationships, and how he \"dies\" over and over, reinventing himself with each new place.Also, while \"Waiting\" is fairly linear, this book goes back and forth alot. There is still a chronological narrative, but he also goes to different points in time. I think some of these scenes could be saved for a potential third memoir.In general, the mood of \"Learning\" is much darker. But in this time of questioning what to do with the immigration policies in America, particularly with DACA, having the perspective of the struggles of an immigrant child is particularly important."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Poignant story brilliantly recalled by a sensitive and Spirit-filled man whom I would love to know!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This book touched my heart.  I left Cuba and came to the US at age twelve. Although I came with my parents, sister and nephew, I can identify with the struggles, pain and injustices Carlos and his brother went through not to mention the rest of the Cuban kids who were sent to US alone through the Peter Pan Project. Many of these kids never saw their parents again.

How he and his brother survived the callousness of Castro's government in letting children out of Cuba without parents is a miracle in itself. The miracle continues here with the sad, hard saga of Eire growing up here in poverty and very little love. Astonishing that he is now a professor at Yale. Eire's hatred of the Communist Revolution in Cuba is well placed."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A great sequel to Waiting for Snow in Havana.

That book literally ends in midair as eleven-year-old Carlos and his older brother leave Havana on an airplane\u2014along with thousands of other children\u2014to begin their new life in Miami in 1962. It would be years before he would see his mother again. He would never again see his beloved father.\r\n\r\nLearning to Die in Miami opens as the plane lands and Carlos faces, with trepidation and excitement, his new life. He quickly realizes that in order for his new American self to emerge, his Cuban self must \"die.\" And so, with great enterprise and purpose, he begins his journey.\r\n\r\nWe follow Carlos as he adjusts to life in his new home. Faced with learning English, attending American schools, and an uncertain future, young Carlos confronts the age-old immigrant\u2019s plight: being surrounded by American bounty, but not able to partake right away. The abundance America has to offer excites him and, regardless of how grim his living situation becomes, he eagerly forges ahead with his own personal assimilation program, shedding the vestiges of his old life almost immediately, even changing his name to Charles. Cuba becomes a remote and vague idea in the back of his mind, something he used to know well, but now it \"had ceased to be part of the world.\"\r\n\r\nBut as Carlos comes to grips with his strange surroundings, he must also struggle with everyday issues of growing up. His constant movement between foster homes and the eventual realization that his parents are far away in Cuba bring on an acute awareness that his life has irrevocably changed. Flashing back and forth between past and future, we watch as Carlos balances the divide between his past and present homes and finds his way in this strange new world, one that seems to hold the exhilarating promise of infinite possibilities and one that he will eventually claim as his own.\r\n\r\nAn exorcism and an ode, Learning to Die in Miami is a celebration of renewal\u2014of those times when we\u2019re certain we have died and then are somehow, miraculously, reborn.\r\n\r\n\u201cEire is a tremendously likable narrator, honest about the limitations of memory, always wearing his heart on his sleeve.\u2026those who remember the exuberant kid from Waiting for Snow in Havana\u2026will be moved by the man he becomes.\u201d The New York Times Book Review", "asin": "1439181918", "rank": "591689", "city": "Miami", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51iTP-HgK%2BL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
