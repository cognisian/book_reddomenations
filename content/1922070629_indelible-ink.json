Indelible Ink has flawed yet likeable characters, and several unexpected twists and turns. I'm always looking for Australian novels that accurately depict the Australia of today and this does, very well. McGregor has a magnificent ability to write so that her characters seem like people I know. The wealthy, greedy father, the children who can't live up to their father's career goals but need to find themselves in other ways, the family conflict where adults become children again and lastly the mother who holds them all together but is on her own personal journey of discovery. Set in Sydney, shifting between Mosman and Surry Hills, this is the story of a segment of Marie King\u2019s life. Marie, aged 59 and divorced, has lost herself. She lives in a beautiful home in Mosman, and appears to have led a relatively privileged life however somewhere along the way, Marie seems to have lost her sense of self. One day, bolstered by the bravery of alcohol, Marie wanders into a tattoo parlour. Her first tattoo leads to others, and introduces Marie or sometimes reminds her of other aspects of life. Marie\u2019s friends, and her children Clark, Blanche and Leon do not understand Marie\u2019s need for tattoos. I found the novel fascinating because of the way Fiona McGregor depicts Marie\u2019s search for her own sense of life and what is important to her.There is no happy ending in this novel, no chance for a happy new beginning. But, the Marie with whom we end the novel is a more fulfilled woman than the Marie with whom we commenced it. A gripping book that squeezes your heart. 5 + stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Indelible Ink is a frank and honest look at family life. The main character Marie is at cross roads and seems to have lost a sense of self. In my opinion her life is full of superficial relationships that parallel the drought Sydney is going through in the book. Most of the characters are shallow and therefore difficult to like.This would have been a 3 star review except for the fact that it\u2019s set in Sydney - a city I know well which helped me enjoy the story."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Set in Sydney, shifting between Mosman and Surry Hills, this is the story of a segment of Marie King\u2019s life.  Marie, aged 59 and divorced, is unsatisfied with aspects of her life.  Sure, she lives in a beautiful home in Mosman, and appears to have led a relatively privileged life.  But somewhere along the way, Marie seems to have lost her sense of self.  Increasingly, she is aware that she can no longer support the lifestyle she\u2019s become used to on the allowance her ex-husband Ross pays. One day, bolstered by the bravery bestowed by alcohol, Marie wanders into a tattoo parlour.  Her first tattoo leads to others, and introduces Marie (or sometimes reminds her) of other aspects of life.Marie\u2019s friends, and her children Clark, Blanche and Leon do not understand Marie\u2019s need for (or is it an obsession with?) tattoos.  For a while, it seems as though Marie is in control of her life, but is she?I found this novel challenging, and interesting.  Challenging because I found it very difficult to feel much sympathy for any of the characters.  I don\u2019t recognise much of the world that Marie, her friends and children inhabit.  And yet, despite the privilege and opportunity conferred by wealth, few of the characters seemed comfortable or happy either with themselves or the world.  I found the novel interesting because of the way Ms McGregor depicts Marie\u2019s search for her own sense of life and what is important to her.  There\u2019s something about Marie\u2019s desire to define herself separate from her family and her environment, about her appreciation of beauty in nature which held my attention.  It is mid-summer, and Sydney is in drought.  Many of the lives of those in the novel are also \u2018in drought\u2019, needing nourishment to meet their potential.There is no happy ending in this novel, no chance for a happy new beginning.  Life is often like that.  But, to me at least, the Marie with whom we end the novel is a more fulfilled woman than the Marie with whom we commenced it.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "It is very seldom that I cannot finish a novel once started, but this one I could not persevere with.

The story flowed well, despite moving between the perspective of the main 4 family members - and all the characters, and their surrounds, were beautifully drawn. I identified with the location as I have spent most of my adult life in this area, including 19 years in a neighbouring suburb.  However I couldn't identify with the characters, particularly the 3 adult children.  I found them to be terribly self indulgent.  I did not like some of the language and could not imagine the Mosman matrons (Marie's generation) that I knew, using it.  I also did not like the ending.  Although there was some hope that the 'children' were resolving some of their issues, I felt left up in the air.  However, if you like to read something different that may also challenge some of your perceptions, then I recommend this book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Anyone who loves ink, anyone who enjoys reading of another human being breaking out, will take to this book.
