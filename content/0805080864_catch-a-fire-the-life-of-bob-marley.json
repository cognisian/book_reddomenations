And surely a 500-page book on Marley is going to be nothing but an amazing experience to learn every nook and cranny related to his life.  But you realize the author must've done so much research and had no many notes and interviews and tidbits and facts that he just figured he'd cram them into the book and no one would notice that Bob Marley wouldn't really appear until about page 100 and die a little past page 300.The rest is dense and plodding and felt like homework to get through all the aspects of religion and politics and the economy and... (you get the point, I think)The book is fascinating and you can't help but learn a lot about Bob Marley (who knew he lived in the United States and had a series of menial jobs before making it big?!) but I think the Marley doc from 2012 does just as good a job at a fraction of the time.\"Faith in Jah got Marley in touch with his conscience, and faith in himself set him on a course so unlikely and so edifying that no soul around the main remained unmoved by the dimensions and lessons of Bob's self-realization.\""}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Talk about surpassing my expectations! I went into this thinking Bob Marley's life would be covered from birth to death. But, it is so much more than that. I really enjoyed learning about his family and other things going on in Jamaica at the time. It was fascinating to learn where Marley came from, how he grew up, and how he ascended to fame. Amazing where he ended up compared to where he started.The author went somewhat into death, at the beginning, and at the end. It would have been helpful if it was all in one place. By the end of the book, I had forgotten most of the original details about Marley's death.I do think some things distracted the reader from the main story. Everything ties in, but pages about kings in Africa can distract and then the reader forgets where the original story started. Also, there is SO much detail included. Sometimes it seemed like details were included just to include them, like the street name of some random character that isn't part of the story. These don't take away from the story but could have been without.All-in-all, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn the story behind Marley and his family."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I haven't read it, but my husband really likes it."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "In my opinion,  the author took too many liberties in his writing as a cultural outsider which caused him to misinterprete things, however, this book did help me understand Ras Tafari.
