Whether reflecting on anti-Semitism in stories such as \"Story of My Dovecote\" and \"First Love,\" or depicting Jewish gangsters in his native Odessa, Babel\u2019s eye for the comical laid bare the ironies of history. His masterpiece, \"Red Cavalry,\" set in the Soviet-Polish war, is one of the classics of modern fiction. \r\n\r\nBy turns flamboyant and restrained, this collection of Babel\u2019s best-known stories vividly expresses the horrors of his age. This translation is based on the complete, original text taken from an unexpurgated Russian edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Amazing not only as literature but as biography.\" The New York Times ", "asin": "0140449973", "rank": "695246", "city": "Odessa", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lCXoyd9CL.jpg", "country": "Ukraine", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
