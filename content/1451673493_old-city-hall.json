Not a thriller as others have noted, but with rich, well developed characters so that you care what happens to them even when nothing much is happening to them. One word of caution however, this is a nostalgic view of Toronto, probably in the early 1990s. People still remember WWII as adult memories and the Internet and cell phones do not appear. I enjoyed it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent !"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I read a lot of legal thrillers, and this book is definitely in my top ten.  Rotenberg is an amazing writer.  The book is a real nail biter, too, with lots of clues as to the perpetrator given throughout.  The characters are well written and interesting. I learned a lot about the British legal system used in Canada, because of Rotenberg's legal background.
