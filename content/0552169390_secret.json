As I read the beginning of the book I kept seeing myself in Cassie. Especially after being in a long dating relationship of four years. I felt a bit lost. As Cassie changed I felt like I was taking those steps with her. I became more confident in myself, more fearless, more outgoing!

Also rated \"good\" as apposed to the two stars i'd give that gray shaded, more contrived, poorly written inspiration for this trilogy.  My personal rating is \"it's okay,\" since I found her plotline - and the erotic experiences - too predictable."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I read this book in one afternoon.

I liked it! I cannot wait to get the 2nd and 3rd books! This book has a lot of qualities that I look for in a book. I love the description of scenarios so that I can really picture them in my head. I liked the sarcasm and big personality of the characters...Cassie was a wonderful character. This book has me wishing S.E.C.R.E.T was real. I would definitely do something like this. I love how Cassie grew to love herself and be comfortable/confident in her own skin...which is what I need to learn how to do for myself. Great job to the author!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Wish there was more in this series as i just loved the storyline  n the way it all tied in together, it still could of been taken so much further, in many other angles n storylines.
