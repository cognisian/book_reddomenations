Whereas Pulp Fiction was shockingly original and, at times, brutally violent; Jackie Brown was based upon the novel Rum Punch by Elmore Leonard.  I\u2019ve read many of Leonard\u2019s works and enjoy his style, which is dialogue heavy.  In Leonard\u2019s later works he brazenly focused on dialogue and let the reader fill in a lot of the blanks around it.  This method might not work for a lessor writer but Leonard was so good at dialogue, and penned such intriguing characters, that books were eminently readable and wonderfully entertaining.  In particular, Leonard has always had a joyful talent for creating mean scumbags and ne\u2019er-do-wells. Rum Punch is a solid outing by Leonard but I wouldn\u2019t put it at the top of his list.  It tells the story of a stewardess caught smuggling money for a drug dealer and how she attempts to extricate herself from the mess.  Tarantino took on the story and did something wonderful with it.  His master stroke was casting Pam Grier and Robert Forster in the leads.  Grier was infamous for the Blaxploitation films of the 70\u2019s but hadn\u2019t been in a major production in years.  Forster had made a lot of fine movies over the years but was \u201coff the radar\u201d as a leading man.  Tarantino wonderfully explores both in their middle ages wrestling with who they\u2019ve turned out to be and what the future might, or might not hold, for each.  He pits them against a Tarantino favorite, Samuel L. Jackson, as Ordell, a happily conniving thug.  The basic characters are Leonard\u2019s and the foundation of the plot is his but Tarantino reels in the story a bit and tightens it up.  Rum Punch is a solid story and worth reading, as is most of Leonard\u2019s stuff.  But Tarantino made it a better story and put together a fantastic movie anchored by impressive performances.  Read the book but don\u2019t dare miss a chance to catch the movie."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Jackie Brown was Quentin Tarantino\u2019s third movie, his follow up to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.

The great characters and interesting plot are obscured by the structural, writerly affectations Leonard insists on using in the book, accomplishing nothing that I can see other than amusing himself by doing so.So, this is one of the rare occasions where the movie -- Tarantino's \"Jackie Brown\" -- does Leonard better, by removing those affectations and whose new affectations mirror Leonard's strength with dialogue and character.Sorry, Mr. Leonard."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Everyone knows this is widely regarded as one of Leonard's finest works. The proof is in how Tarantino was able to adapt it to the screen for Jackie Brown. This is Elmore Leonard at his grittiest. It's a page-turner and extremely hard to put down. Characters are well-developed and the dialogue is crisp and authentic. Others would debate about which book is best - but you can pretty much stack this up against anything Leonard has done and it will hold up. Always worth digging in and finding a worn, first edition, too. For writers, this is a must-have, how-to. For Tarantino fans, it'll show you how great the source material was and still is."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Better than the movie, which was very good.  It's E.
