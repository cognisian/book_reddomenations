Colman Andrews has spent over a decade in conversation with Ferran, as well as countless hours in his restaurant and workshop, and his account recasts Ferran's remarkable career with unrestricted access to the chef and his family and friends, as well as decades of accumulated insights and interviews with the most prominent chefs and critics.\r\n\r\nelBulli was a Michelin 3-star restaurant near the town of Roses, Catalonia, Spain, run by chef Ferran Adri\u00e0. The small restaurant overlooked Cala Montjoi, a bay on Catalonia's Costa Brava, and was described as \"the most imaginative generator of haute cuisine on the planet.\" The restaurant was also associated with molecular gastronomy. The restaurant closed on July 30, 2011 and was reopened as a creativity centre in 2014.
