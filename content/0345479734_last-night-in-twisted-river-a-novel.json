This novel is most certainly the product of years, maybe decades, of effort on behalf of Irving to create Daniel (Danny) and his world. It's hard to remember that this isn't autobiographical and that these people, particularly Danny and Ketchum, are (mostly) imagined. The story begins when Daniel is 12 and ends when he is in his 60s, but it doesn't plod along too slowly, and it kept my attention (I found the Rabbit Run series by Updike to be one book too many). If you are willing to read something with beautifully developed characters but a less exciting/captivating plot, it is certainly worth your time."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I love John Irving, and this is now my 2nd favorite book by him after A Prayer for Owen Meany.
