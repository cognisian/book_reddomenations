Infinite City, Rebecca Solnit\u2019s brilliant reinvention of the traditional atlas, searches out the answer by examining the many layers of meaning in one place, the San Francisco Bay Area. Aided by artists, writers, cartographers, and twenty-two gorgeous color maps, each of which illuminates the city and its surroundings as experienced by different inhabitants, Solnit takes us on a tour that will forever change the way we think about place. \r\n\r\nShe explores the area thematically\u2014connecting, for example, Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s foundation of motion-picture technology with Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s filming of Vertigo. Across an urban grid of just seven by seven miles, she finds seemingly unlimited landmarks and treasures\u2014butterfly habitats, queer sites, murders, World War II shipyards, blues clubs, Zen Buddhist centers. \r\n\r\nShe roams the political terrain, both progressive and conservative, and details the cultural geographies of the Mission District, the culture wars of the Fillmore, the South of Market world being devoured by redevelopment, and much, much more. \r\n\r\nBreathtakingly original, this atlas of the imagination invites us to search out the layers of San Francisco that carry meaning for us\u2014or to discover our own infinite city, be it Cleveland, Toulouse, or Shanghai.\r\n\r\nCONTRIBUTORS:\r\n\r\nCartographers: Ben Pease and Shizue Seigel\r\n\r\nDesigner: Lia Tjandra\r\n\r\n\u201cInventive and affectionate.\u201d New York Times ", "asin": "0520262506", "rank": "45266", "city": "San Francisco", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Muq7rbTML.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
