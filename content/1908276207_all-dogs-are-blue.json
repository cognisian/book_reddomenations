I love the experimental style which may not be to everybody's taste. Unlike some experimental books, this is very readable and easy to get into. It is really out there, but it makes sense.I probably couldn't give something like this the review it deserves. This is poetry! This is art! Sometimes disturbing, but beautiful throughout.

It was the first one I received as a part of my AndOtherStories subscription, and it didn't disappoint - from the first page you are dragged into an intensely creative and compelling portrait of madness.I must make the proviso that I really love experimental literature. Not the kind of experimentalism that is self-aware and insincere, but the kind that makes us feel that writing is a craft, and some people are truly masters of it. The kind that breaks moulds and makes literature feel like an achievement.In All Dogs Are Blue, the stylistic elements of the story are just what experimental literature should be - vibrant and pulsing with life and purpose, making you feel the story physically as well as mentally. I loved the fresh words, the way it bounced from idea to idea, and all against the surreal backdrop of a Rio de Janeiro mental institution and the author's own mind-state.To me, this novel is like a bright sun against all the middling novels to be found about life and illness. The fact that this book was written as a reflection of the author's actual inner world makes this story all the more powerful. It is a tragedy that he passed away, on so many levels. From an artistic one, we have lost a great contribution to writing barely before it begun."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "But I\u2019m fragile and delicate like anyone who feels life. Not everybody knows what they want out of life. If you do know, you live life. If you don\u2019t, you feel life.As I\u2019ve mentioned with other works that have come my way from \u201c& Other Stories\u201d, their pursuit of \u201ccollaborative, imaginative and \u2018shamelessly literary\u2019\u201d works fits nicely with my own philosophies of independence and pushing the boundaries. And in \u201cAll Dogs Are Blue\u201d I\u2019ve come across something which is shamelessly BOLD, a work that you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily come across in your day to day reading.Rodrigo De Souze Leao died aged 43 in a psychiatric hospital in Rio de Janeiro in 2008. A schizophrenic, his fragile mental state had him rarely leaving his home and it is through his poetry and, more importantly, this novel that he was held in high regard by a large number of Brazilian writers and poets.Here we have a novel written in broken thoughts, fragments of sentences, visions and musings. But one that shows such complexity and a vivid understanding of narrative style that you cannot help but be dragged along with the author\u2019s torment.Set in a psychiatric ward our narrator is attached to the memories of his childhood toy blue dog, memories of a more stable time before he swallows a cockroach at age 15. His \u201cfriends\u201d in the ward are Baudelaire (a Nineteenth Century French poet who\u2019s most famous works draw heavily on the themes of sex and death) and Rimbaud (another Nineteenth Century French poet who was part of the \u201cdecadent movement\u201d).
