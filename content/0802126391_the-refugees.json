He speaks truth, raw, and always compelling. I bought Refugees after completing his The Sympathizer. Few writers keep you glued to the page with a mix of storyline, philosophy, history, morality, and raw human emotion. Truth can be brutal and he delivers it. He is a fearless writer. Do NOT be put off by what could look like, before reading, a jaundiced ethnic point of view. Why? The writing is universal. His truths should scare the crap out of you and help you face reality with courage and a better perspective. This is one of those books you hate to end, when you read the reviews, the acknowledgements, the legal data, and the number of printings\u2014hoping SWEET JESUS there is more to it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I first read the Sympathizer which was a labyrinthine journey in itself.  I'm impressed with Nguyen's breadth in being able to encompass so many different protagonists.  It was strange being pulled in and unceremoniously jerked out of reach story.  (Especially because, uh, at first I thought this was one larger novel that mixed in the different perspectives.. lol.  I had to read the two stories with the understanding they wouldn't be expanded on later).Anyway, short stories are really hard to write and each one was satisfying.  The themes are universal but there's always a tie back to Vietnam.  So well done."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I'm not a big fan of the short story, but these captivated me.

Nguyen's next fiction book, The Refugees, is a collection of perfectly formed stories written over a period of twenty years, exploring questions of immigration, identity, love, and family.\r\n\r\nWith the coruscating gaze that informed The Sympathizer, in The Refugees Viet Thanh Nguyen gives voice to lives led between two worlds, the adopted homeland and the country of birth. \r\n\r\nFrom a young Vietnamese refugee who suffers profound culture shock when he comes to live with two gay men in San Francisco, to a woman whose husband is suffering from dementia and starts to confuse her for a former lover, to a girl living in Ho Chi Minh City whose older half-sister comes back from America having seemingly accomplished everything she never will, the stories are a captivating testament to the dreams and hardships of immigration. \r\n\r\nThe second piece of fiction by a major new voice in American letters, The Refugees is a beautifully written and sharply observed book about the aspirations of those who leave one country for another, and the relationships and desires for self-fulfillment that define our lives.\r\n", "asin": "0802126391", "rank": "6421", "city": "San Francisco", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51a2768yYbL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
