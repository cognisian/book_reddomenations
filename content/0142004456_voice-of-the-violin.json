However, from a crime novel point of view, the story was disappointing. Most importantly the story did not make any sense to me. This includes the motive for the murder, but also many other aspects that I don't want to give away. Also, the police investigation was very sloppy with many mistakes that did not come across in the book as such - maybe the author overlooked them. Protagonists are not supposed to be perfect, on the contrary, but it was not believable to me that a real police unit would work like this. I did not have this issue with the Terracotta Dog."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "What can one say, its Inspector Montalbano and therefore an excellent read.
