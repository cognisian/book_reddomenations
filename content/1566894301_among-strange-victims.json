So I entered this novel with high expectations. One of the pleasures of Among Strange Victims is how it wrong-foots any such expectations. I could never quite figure out where this book was going, but at the same time, it doesn\u2019t seem perverse or willful in its misdirections. It\u2019s the outpouring of a highly unique and original comic mind, and it seems to have found its own strange and necessary shape.The novel opens with a series of diaristic entries from a low-level museum \u201cknowledge administrator\u201d Rodrigo, a young and aimless soul whose great projects are exploring the vacant lot next to his tiny apartment and building a collection of tea bags from a dingy caf\u00e9 he calls the \u201ccaf\u00e9 without coffee.\u201d He is a sort of Sartrean existentialist with a sinecure\u2014he likes to masturbate twice on Saturdays, he tells us, and carries a faded scrap of 1980s pornography in his wallet.When Rodrigo gets engaged early in the novel, it\u2019s mostly the result of a misunderstanding he doesn\u2019t bother to clear up. He seems content to let this office snafu dictate his fate. Soon Rodrigo is sharing his tiny, vacant-lot-adjoining apartment with his wife Cecilia, the museum secretary, in a less than ideal match. Rodrigo\u2019s obsessions do not change until he endures an especially putrid form of home invasion, the discovery of which closes out the first section.At this point the novel switches gears, and begins to follow Marcelo Valente, a Spanish professor of aesthetics who heads to the Mexican town of Los Girasoles to research the life of Richard Foret, a modernist poet who spent his last hallucinatory days in the town before disappearing. (The move recalls Bola\u00f1o, both structurally and thematically, especially \u201cThe Part about the Critics\u201d in 2666.)Salda\u00f1a Par\u00eds\u2019s skewering of Valente\u2019s pomposity and romanticism is a total delight. For a while, given the presence of narcos and military security around the bleak housing estate where Valente rents\u2014someone fooled him with pictures on the Internet\u2014you expect that a violent tabloid fate might be in store for him. But here again, Among Strange Victims defies expectations.It would be wrong to say more, but the plots end up intertwining beautifully, in a totally unexpected endgame that only this novel could produce, visionary and satirical at once. This is funny, lewd, irreverent work\u2014 Bola\u00f1o himself comes in for ribbing when Rodrigo encounters two young foreign exchange students who enthuse about The Savage Detectives in one of the novel\u2019s several gloomy cantinas. It\u2019s the kind of blow-off tribute B. might appreciate, were he still with us.\u201cThe only open cantina they came across had a more dubious air than the one they had left, although to an inexperienced eye, it might have been the very same cantina, which is exactly what Daga said when they looked inside: \u2018It\u2019s the same cantina.\u2019\u201dA very small sample of what makes Salda\u00f1a Par\u00eds special\u2014his sentences. While I can\u2019t speak to accuracy, Christina MacSweeney\u2019s English translation is a thing of great wit, flow, and range. We\u2019re lucky to have it."}]}, "authors": ["Daniel Salda\u00f1a Par\u00eds"], "isbn": "1566894301", "longitude": -99.1333416, "periods": ["2000s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "Among Strange Victims", "word_cloud": "superbly write story man try connection world people touch humor humility something way look absolutely captivate repeatable look forward classic second person narrative beautiful brilliance self involve boy exceptional ability translate surreal experience others true gift best last remind next year unfortunately second everything write nothing add anymore come highly recommended friend professor call best writer generation enter high expectation pleasures expectation never figure go time perverse willful misdirection outpouring highly unique original comic mind seem find necessary open series diarist entry museum knowledge administrator young aimless soul great project explore vacant lot tiny apartment build collection tea bag dingy cafe call cafe sort existentialist like masturbate twice tell carry fade scrap pornography get engage early mostly result misunderstand bother clear seem content office snafu dictate fate share tiny apartment wife museum secretary le ideal match obsession change endure especially putrid form home invasion discovery close first point switch gear begin follow professor aesthetic head town research life modernist poet spend last hallucinatory day town disappear move recall structurally thematically especially skewer pomposity romanticism total delight give presence narc military security bleak housing estate fool picture expect violent tabloid fate defies plot end intertwine beautifully totally unexpected endgame visionary satirical funny lewd irreverent come rib encounter young foreign exchange student enthuse detectives several gloomy cantinas kind tribute still open canting come dubious air leave inexperienced eye exactly say looked small sample make sentence speak accuracy translation thing great wit flow range lucky", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Humour"], "summary": "Rodrigo likes his vacant lot, its resident chicken, and being left alone. But when passivity finds him accidentally married to Cecilia, he trades Mexico City for the sun-bleached desolation of his hometown and domestic life with Cecilia for the debauched company of a poet, a philosopher, and Micaela, whose allure includes the promise of time travel.
