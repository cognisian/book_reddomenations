This book was no exception. Twists kept me guessing throughout, and I really cannot stress enough how great her characters are.

I am being snarky here, of course, but after reading all her previous novels, about the Dublin Murder squad, I just had to ask this question. I will not give anything away for those that want to lose several hours of their life they will never get back. Just read all the other \u201c1\u201d ratings because that is exactly what I am going to echo myself. As soon as I got to the paranormal references, I quit. It was like putting the icing on a inedible cake! RARELY, do I not finish a book and I read daily.

Read the 1st 4 books and expected to be less impressed with book # 5, but this is definitely not the case.  I found the vivid description of settings, touching all the senses, to be as well written as her previous books. Character development  was great great...had a good take on all of the main players.  These books can be easily read in any order as they are only connected with the 'murder squad' as the thread, but I would love to see some more of these characters come back.  The timeliness of electronic devices and bullying and adolescents is unfortunately so prevalent today."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I got much more enjoyment from reading these 1 star reviews than this boring book.Made it to page 300 and decided to stop wasting my time."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This book would have been five stars if it were not for the language.

Hard to pick a fav between this and Into the Woods, but I highly recommend The Secret Place! Twists and turns that I definitely didn't see coming.
