Having read all of his major works, I can list my ratings as follows. Individual critiques have been posted for each title.\u201cLittle Man, What Now?\u201d 4 stars. The futility of the hand-to-mouth existence of a white-collar worker and his wife in early 1930s Germany.\u201cThe Drinker\u201d 4 stars. An intense account of a successful, happily married businessman\u2019s downward spiral into alcohol addiction, drunken altercations, infidelity, adultery, delusional episodes, leading to his arrest and eventual confinement to merciless penal institution.\u201cSmall Circus\u201d 2 stars. A confusing, ponderous, bloated, provincial novel. Factions, political intrigue, rivalries involving about seventy characters.\u201cEvery Man Dies Alone\u201d 5 stars.  Grounded in the author's own experiences living under the heel of Hitler's divisively oppressive regime. This is fiction steeped in legitimate historical relevance. Published after WW2.\u201cWolf Among Wolves\u201d 3.5 stars. A tortuous tapestry of urban and rural life in post-war Germany, 1923-24. Economic realities are chaotic with inflation having gone out of control. The social fabric is disintegrating. The plot revolves around about a dozen characters, the chief one being Wolfgang Pagel, a young former soldier who survives by gambling. Later circumstances bring him to a rural estate where he becomes the financial manager of farm, forest and livestock operations.Most of Fallada\u2019s works follow the \u2018new objectivity\u2019 literary style represented by detailed accounts akin to journalistic reportage. Dozens of characters are introduced in the first half of the book. I found myself making notes to keep track of who was related to whom and what. It does take a bit of work to keep track since most are referred to by titles or positions and other times by their names. The second half introduces some interesting new characters as they are joined by those of the main ones from the first half. There is no tranquility in this novel. Conflicts, rivalries, intrigues and deceptions abound. Somehow it felt devoid of emotional drama.Having great admiration for Fallada\u2019s other works, I loyally continued reading but frankly much of it was a slog. I hoped things would sort themselves out. Mostly they did albeit some of them tragically. Was it worth it? I would only recommend this book to devout Fallada devotees or to history buffs interested in the German social and economic chaos of the 1920s, which engendered the appeal of the Nazi ideology and the rise of its despotic strongman Adolph Hitler in the 30s."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Beautiful"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great book"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "What a terrific book.  I found this book in a bookstore a couple of years back and even though I had purchased the book, kept putting off the book in view of its sheer volume (It is about 800 pages).  As an economist by profession, I knew about the hyper inflation and the daily depreciation of the currency during the inter war period in Germany but to bring the pain brought by the change in the value of currency, through about a dozen characters was truly amazing and once having started reading the book, I just could not put down the book and finished the book in about a fortnight (which is a record by my standards).

Set in Weimar Germany soon after Germany's catastrophic loss of World War I, the story follows a young gambler who loses all in Berlin, then flees the chaotic city, where worthless money and shortages are causing pandemonium. Once in the countryside, however, he finds a defeated German army that has deamped there to foment insurrection. Somehow, amidst it all, he finds romance--it's The Year of Living Dangerously in a European setting.\r\n\r\nFast-moving as a thriller, fascinating as the best historical fiction, and with lyrical prose that packs a powerful emotional punch, Wolf Among Wolves is the equal of Fallada's acclaimed Every Man Dies Alone as an immensely absorbing work of important literature.", "asin": "1933633921", "rank": "478536", "city": "Berlin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CS7y%2BrNIL.jpg", "country": "Germany", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
