Living in Salvador de Bahia (how did one of the reviewers above get the impression the book was set in Fortaleza?), he must have daily witnessed the situation of the \"ninhos da rua\", a tragic reality still today in most of Brazil.Though, I'm not sure the portrayal is so honest he claims at the end as the best quality of the book. Amado clearly cares a lot about those kids, the benign point of view towards them so obvious, at a point that when a rape is committed, it seems no big deal.Amado describes several different type of \"Captains of the sands\" each one with his peculiar attributes, but the look is always too sympathetic and he cannot keep a more detached viewpoint to the extent of somehow undermining the pedagogical intent of the book of portraying the reality of Brazilian abandoned kids.Subjects as the poverty, the solidarity among the poor, the right of the workers, the strike, the Communist ideology of social justice, the hypocrisy of some clergymen, the magnanimity of others, are all touched here and there, sometimes maybe too ambitiously, in \"black and white\" characterization. Impossible not to notice that basically at the same time, John Steinbeck was laying the foundations for his masterpiece \"The Grapes of Wrath\" published in 1939 (three years later than Amado's), where these same topics are addressed in such a sublime form of literature.Still, Amado sincere participation to these kids' fate, his felt contribution in letting everyone know, the peculiar traits of the multi-ethnic Brazilian culture, makes this read enjoyable and I look forward to some oh his later, and best known works"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Like a Brazilian, I love it!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Good read"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Marvelous, raw, touching!
