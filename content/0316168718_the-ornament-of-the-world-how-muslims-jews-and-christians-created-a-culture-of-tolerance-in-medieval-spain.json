In 755 AD a 20 year old Muslim man, named Abd al-Rahman, traveled from Damascus (Syria) to Cordoba (Spain). He was a member of the ruling Umayyad family, most of whom had been killed by the rival Abbasid family. In Cordoba the rulers were Goths (Christians) who had overrun the Roman empire centuries earlier. Within a few years, Abd al-Rahman became the ruler of Cordoba and then the rest of southern Spain. He did this not as much by military conquest but instead by leadership in technology.b. During the next 300 years, these Muslims (called Moors) became the intellectual center of the world. The rest of Europe was a going through the Dark Ages, which included many wars and the plague. The Moors were very tolerant of other religions. They even created a word, \u201cdhimmi\u201d when refers to the policy of protecting minorities. When the Moors first arrived in Spain the Jews lived a very frugal life. After the Moors, the Jews became the most prosperous in the world.c. The Moors emphasized the study of ancient literature. They translated many Greek and Roman texts into Arabic. The library in Cordoba contained more than 400,000 books. Libraries in other parts of Europe usually contained no more than 400 books. The Moors had learned how to produce inexpensive paper (from the Chinese) and they had a large paper factory in Valencia. They also made major advances in Algebra. This included the use of the decimal point (invented in India).d. Cordoba was conquered by barbarians from north Africa (Berbers) in the year 1009. Their culture was transplanted 100 miles to the east in Granada. In 1238 the last Muslim dynasty in Spain, called the Nasrids, started building the complex of castles called the Alhambra. This is located on a large hill in Granada suitable for self-defense. In 1085 a Christian monarch, named Alfonso VI of Castile, took over Toledo, a city which is about 200 miles north of Grenada. He chose to protect the Moorish culture. During the next 150 years, most of the Jews in Granada moved to Toledo. In 1492 Ferdinand and Isabella took over the Alhambra and built their own castle inside some of the other castles there. They expelled all the Jews from Spain and they burned all the books that the Moors had written in Arabic. This was the beginning of the Spanish Inquisition, which lasted almost 400 years.e. The author named Cervantes was born in Toledo and grew up there. In 1615 he published his book titled \u201cDon Quixote\u201d, which became the second most widely read book in the world (after the Bible). The story included complaints about intolerance. By the year 1400 the intellectual center of the world moved to Italy, notably, Florence. This is called the Renaissance.f. In 1829, an American author named Washington Irving visited the Alhambra. His book, titled \u201cTales of the Alhambra\u201d prompted the Spanish government to start restoring this area, which consists of four palaces. The beauty of this area and the amazing skill of our tour guide made this by far my favorite excursion of the entire cruise!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I read the kindle edition while in Spain and it made my trip so  interesting!

Ancient Greek and Roman works of arts and sciences almost disappeared after the fall of the Roman Empire but those that survived were preserved by being translated into Arabic and then later into Latin igniting a revival of learning that resulted in our modern world.
