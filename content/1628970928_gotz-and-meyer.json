In a style that sometimes approaches David Grossman and even Saramago, David Albahari's book is a must for anyone who wants to understand what happened in a place that, until today, is not a museum or a commemorative mausoleum for those who lived and died there"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "By the numbers, the murder of the Serbian Jews in Belgrade during 1941-1942 was much closer to a tragedy than a statistic. And it is of this \"tragedy\", that Serbian author David Albahari writes his short novel, \"Gotz and Meyer\". Written in the first person by an unnamed Serbian Jew who had escaped the mass murder by going into hiding with his mother as an infant, the story proceeds at a fast pace as the man tries to understand what happened in Belgrade in that two year period.After the Germans invaded Serbia in 1941, a large majority of the male Serbian Jewish population was hauled off and shot by the SS, aided by local Serbian anti-Semites. The remaining Jews - mostly women, children, and the elderly - were put into the Semlin Judenlager, where they waited to be sent off \"somewhere else\". What really happened was that they were loaded into sealed trucks - 100 or so at a time - and driven around til gassed to death. Their bodies were then off-loaded and buried. So efficient was the gassing operation that Serbia - along with Poland and the Soviet Union - were the only Nazi-occupied country NOT to have to send off their Jewish population for extermination. They were killed \"in situ\", so to speak...David Albahari takes the facts about the camp and the gas vans and writes a story around two of the German drivers of the gas vans. He doesn't know their real names, but invents \"Gotz\" and \"Meyer\", and imagines how they viewed their job and the people they were murdering 100 at a time. The nameless teacher in today's Belgrade - the only family member left after the death of his parents long after the war - descends into a kind of madness as he tries to figure out what happened and how the two imagined - \"Gotz\" and \"Meyer\" - went about their murderous business. Albahari also introduces other characters, but the two (imagined) fair-haired monsters who he thinks gave out candy to the camps children before loading them into the gas van, along with the unnamed narrator are the main focus of the story.Because we are only talking about very small remnant of millions murdered, the horror of these murders is even more telling. Reading about today's man being driven mad while trying to deal with the murders of his relatives gives David Albahari's novel even more impact."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is in my top five best books ever read-- high praise considering the amount of books I have read over the years as well as the amount of books on the holocaust.  Mr. albahari's writing is phenominal and the translator's skills are masterful. I chose it for my book club and all the others rated it highly as well.  This book could easily be a movie."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "It is 1941 or 1942.Every day, G\u00f6tz and Meyer drive a truck between the Fairground on the left bank of the River Sava in Belgrade and the village of Jajinci on the southern edge of Belgrade. They run a regular transport service between the two places. On each outward bound trip, they leave the Fairgrounds with about 100 passengers in the back of their window-less truck. They always return with an empty truck.G\u00f6tz and Meyer, the crew operating the truck are both members of the Schutzstaffel (the `SS'). Their passengers, who board the truck ignorant of the fact that they are embarking on the last journey that they are ever going to make, are all Jewish. Somewhere, between the Fairgrounds and Jajinci, the driver of the truck, who might be either G\u00f6tz or Meyer, stops the truck, and his colleague, it would be Meyer if G\u00f6tz were driving, steps outside and crawls under the truck. There, he attaches the vehicle's exhaust pipe to an opening under the passenger compartment behind the driver's cab, and returns to his colleague waiting at the steering wheel. They continue their journey, and by the time they reach Jajinci, all of their 100 passengers will have died of carbon monoxide poisoning.David Albahari, the author of G\u00f6tz and Meyer, is a Serbian of Jewish origin, born in Kossovo. He was born in 1948, and therefore narrowly missed experiencing the horrors of the German occupation of his native Yugoslavia. In G\u00f6tz and Meyer, Albahari explores the tragedy that hit the Jews of Belgrade by trying to enter the minds of the two operators of the truck, who were, after all is said and done, merely following orders. I suppose that it would be fair to say that the author does succeed in doing this,but I did not find the resulting novel particularly satisfying."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "In 1942 the Nazis exterminated virtually all of Belgrade's 10,000 Jews and declared it the only large European city where the Jewish and Gypsy Question had been \"solved.\" This is the topic of David Albahari's G\u00f6tz and Meyer (2003), a manic first-person narrative of a Jewish literature professor in modern-day Belgrade who, in exploring his obliterated family tree, becomes obsessed with the circumstances of their extermination and the two German officers tasked with carrying it out, G\u00f6tz and Meyer.These two men, for which only scant archival evidence exists, are largely embellished by the narrator's imagination. The narrator imagines their wives and children, their morning hygiene rituals, dreams and everyday conversations, and in this Albahari truly excels. His penchant for palpable characters and idiosyncrasy brings to life otherwise cold historical data, a process that culminates when the narrator takes his students on a reenactment of the asphyxiation ritual performed by G\u00f6tz and Meyer on Jewish passengers. As human beings we have, the narrator (and author) insists, a moral imperative to remember, even to viscerally relive, the past. Through living memory the dead live on and even the victims of senseless tragedies, such as the Holocaust, are in part redeemed.The elaborate working out of the extermination of the Belgrade Jews, and the characters of G\u00f6tz and Meyer in particular, serves another important function in the novel, which distinguishes the work from much of previous Holocaust discourse. Although the narrator's tone is complex and often slips into irony and satire, it is largely a bona fide attempt to understand the psychology of these executioners, who slowly and methodically killed 5,000 people. Unsatisfied by simple condemnation and moral outrage (a viewpoint embodied in the story by the woman at the Jewish Historical Society), he envisions G\u00f6tz and Meyer as complex individuals, with personality quirks, dreams, even brief flashes of compassion and humanity. While the narrator resists anathematizing the executioners, he inevitably hits upon psychological absurdities and callous acts that he categorically rejects.  Nonetheless, his novel inquiry leads to uncomfortable conclusions about universal human evil that recall Hannah Arendt's influential work on the \"banality of evil.\" The author fights against, but ultimately seems to accept, \"the realization that this is not a monstrous distortion, but the implacable order of things (107).\"  Thus the novel expresses a philosophical position, akin to that of 20th-century Existentialism, that life is incomprehensible and absurd. But like Sisyphus, the narrator continues to push his boulder up the hill.The novel engages other important strains of 20th-century philosophy. Foucault's idea of \"carceral continuum\" is central to the inner-workings of the Belgrade concentration camp. The micro-mechanisms of power and enforcement were not limited to Germans, but the Jews inside the camp were tasked with policing themselves. The author's exploration of the need of many Jews for illusions and the desire to be \"an ostrich with its head in the sand\" (80), further problematizes Holocaust discourse. This complex psychology culminates in the narrator's acceptance of chocolate from G\u00f6tz and Meyer, which he eats with pleasure and shame.The novel consists of three planes of narrative that correspond to the narrator's three lives: his contemporary life as a literature professor; his vicarious experience of the lives of his relatives killed in the Holocaust; and his imagined life as G\u00f6tz and Meyer. The story abruptly shifts time periods and points of view according to the his increasingly unstable consciousness. The entire novel is in fact a single stream of consciousness monolog, without chapter breaks, paragraphs or pauses. The narrator's voice becomes increasingly unstable during his research, which provides a rhythm to the story. Nonetheless, some readers will find the manic and disjointed narration exhausting. Moreover, the mediation of all events and characters through the narrator's highly subjective imagination leaves the reader without any other non-imagined voices or points of view. The uncomfortably intimate account of the narrator's thoughts draw the reader into a psychological state of instability and growing despair. While Albahari skillfully achieves this, some readers may find themselves longing for a more traditional style of narration toward the end of the story. On the other hand, the candid exposure to the narrator's mind provides a wealth of interesting psychological material. One wonders, for instance, about his preoccupation with Adam, a 13 year-old boy who was preparing for his bar mitzvah in 1942--could he be a manifestation of the narrator's own repressed memory?David Albahari's G\u00f6tz and Meyer is a rich and complex postmodern account of the experience of the Belgrade Holocaust. It draws the reader into the experience of not only remembering, but reliving these tragic events, and through this act of memory attempts to find some redemption for an otherwise horrific and incomprehensible moment in history. The novel also provides a unique psychological portrait of the executioners G\u00f6tz and Meyer, and in doing so explores universal questions about human frailty. The text is, furthermore, enriched by its engagement of various 20th-century philosophical strains. The formal qualities of the work--its uneven and increasingly manic voice, its internal rhythm and lack of traditional structure, its imaginative nature--mimic the act of remembrance and uncomfortably engage readers and draw them into the narrator's psychological state. G\u00f6tz and Meyer is a rich and complex work and an original addition to the canon of Holocaust literature."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is an exceptional and different book about the Holocaust.It is written ,not by a survivor,but by someone born in Serbia a number of years later, in 1948.  Having lost a large number of his family to Hitler's Final Solution,he does a large amount of research to find out what happened to them,what it was like at the time,and what went through the minds of the perpetrators as well as the victims. Gotz and Meyer,were two SS Non-Commisioned Officers, who the author had found to be charged with the responsibility of transporting about 5,000 women and children from Belgrade's Fairground concentration camp to Jajinci for extermination.They drove the truck,which held about 50 prisoners. The victims were led to believe they were being taken to a better place and would receive decent treatment. A short time after the truck left,it stopped,and the drivers would connect a hose from the exhaust to an attachment that would direct the exhaust fumes into the enclosed truck,thus killing all the prisoners as it continued on its way. Upon arrival,other prisoners removed the corpses and dumped them into trenches already dug by other prisoners. Gotz and Meyer really met face to face to the victims. They seemed to think they were just truck drivers;despite the fact that they really were the murderers when they connected up the exhaust pipes. The author tries to get into the minds of the SS and the victims, trying to determine how they rationalized their actions.Try as he might,there are no way this evilness can be understood and he finds it is madness all around;and he almost loses his mind in attempting to make sense out of it all. I guess the only thing that comes out of all the author's effort is that there is no understanding madness."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Describing the Holocaust, Hannah Arendt wrote of \"the banality of evil.\" In this attempt to understand the unspeakable, Albahari's unnamed narrator, a Jewish schoolteacher in Belgrade, begins not in anger but with empathy. G\u00f6tz and Meyer are two noncommissioned SS officers, whose names he has turned up in the records, while researching the fate of his own forebears. He sees them as ordinary Germans, family men perhaps, fond of children, and taking pride in the efficient accomplishment of their job. That this job is to drive the sealed truck that asphyxiates 100 Jews with engine exhaust on each trip from the holding camp to the burial fields does not lessen his interest in inviting them into his mind, and talking with them in his imagination. Eventually, just as his obsession with the ordinary begins to verge on madness, he embarks on a symbolic reenactment with his own pupils, thus \"sowing the seeds of remembering\" for future generations. This short book, which flows in a single unbroken paragraph of lucid prose, is impossible to put down, and the almost genial understatement of its opening in no way diminishes its cumulative power."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This one paragraph book is interesting in its style and in its subject matter.  The book becomes a little tedious when it is (truly) one paragraph but it is worth sticking with (it's quite short as well) for a captivating conclusion.  S."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This addition to the lengthy bibliography of Holocaust-related fiction centers on the Final Solution's application in Nazi-occupied Serbia from November 1941 to April 1942. Specifically, the camp established at the fairgrounds outside Belgrade, where approximately 5,000 Jews were interred. The narrator is a middle-aged literature professor whose ancestors mostly perished either at the camp or in a truck repurposed as a mobile gas chamber. This truck was operated by the titular SS men, who, over the course of a few months, drove the 5,000 away -- ostensibly to a newer, better facility, but in reality to a mass grave. The book is the professor's reimagining of the two men's duties, of the final weeks of their victims, and of the city's non-Jewish bystanders. Over the course of the book, he delves deeper and deeper into archives, records, and history itself, in an attempt to understand it all -- gradually driving himself somewhat mad in the process. In attempting to put a face on the two Germans, he starts to have conversations with them, and then even visions. Along the way, themes familiar to the Holocaust are touched upon: innocence is meaningless, evil can be faceless, mechanistic, and impersonal, and above all is the question of what we would do confronted with the situation. As the professor grows more and more unstable, the author seems to be warning us that to try and understand any of this is a path to madness. It's all moderately interesting, but not 160 pages interesting. And though Albahari's decision to write the story as a single paragraph with no breaks does add to the sense of claustrophobic mania, it's not exactly reader-friendly. Probably unlikely to be of interest to anyone not already deeply interested in the Holocaust or Serbia."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The speaker of this long monologue by Serbian author David Albahari is a teacher of Serbo-Croatian language and literature, a 50-year-old Jewish man who has been trying to fill in the spaces in his family tree after World War II in Yugoslavia.  The extermination of Jews started early in Yugoslavia, with most of the Jewish men of Serbia shot to death by the fall of 1941, and \"the Jewish Question in Serbia almost completely solved\" by April, 1942, when virtually all Jewish men, women, and children were dead.Imagining the lives of Gotz and Meyer, two SS guards who were responsible for over 5000 Jewish deaths, the speaker examines the events for which Gotz and Meyer were responsible between November, 1941, and April, 1942--the executions of one thousand Jews per month in the Belgrade Saurer truck they drove daily.  The truck, with its hermetically sealed rear compartment, had a hole in the floor into which the exhaust was pumped as prisoners were being taken from the Belgrade Fairgrounds camp, where they were housed, to \"better\" accommodations elsewhere, \"a concern of the German government for the good of the prisoners\" that the speaker finds \"touching.\"Albahari exhibits a mordant humor as his speaker imagines the inner lives of Gotz and Meyer.  Often juxtaposing horrifying atrocity against simple, folksy observation, the speaker fantasizes about \"Gotz, or was it Meyer,\" a phrase which echoes throughout the narrative.  As he puts himself into their minds, he wonders if they had nicknames, if their wives had pet names for them, and if they ever regretted what they were doing, since they were so good at their jobs.  \"Killing, too, is an art,\" the speaker says, \"and it has its own rules.\"As Albahari includes the terrible statistics, he also exhibits the dark ironies of the circumstances, setting the facts into sharp relief and increasing the shock.  He imagines reports on the load distribution of the bodies in the truck and how they might have contributed to a broken rear axle, contemplates the comforting effects of a lightbulb in the truck as the bodies start to fall, and \"worries\" about the red tape of co-ordination.Gradually, Gotz and Meyer become more human for the reader, and when the speaker takes his class on a field trip to the site of the Fairgrounds camp, he asks each to imagine himself/herself as one of his relatives.  As the horror of the events gradually register with the students, the teacher comments: \"Memory is the only way to conquer death,\" he says, \"even when the body merely goes the way of all matter and spins in an endless circle of transformations.\"  A strange novel of the Holocaust, all the more shocking because of the contrasts between the facts and the dark humor, Gotz and Meyer is a memorable short novel and worthy addition to Holocaust literature. n Mary Whipple"}]}, "authors": ["David Albahari"], "isbn": "1628970928", "longitude": 20.4568974, "periods": ["1900s", "Recent Releases"],
