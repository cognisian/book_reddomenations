Some write beautifully.  This writer does both.  The characters are interesting; the imagery is vivid; the language is fresh.  The story moves forward at a nice pace, and the theme is poignant, forever relevant in a world that seems less averse to war than it should.I was immediately struck by the poetry: powerful, vivid, yet simple and clean.  The images were clear and precise, giving the reader a strong feeling of place and mood, without drowning us in adjectives.The characters were compelling.  I cared so much about this blind girl, how she would navigate through a world that had suddenly become so treacherous, and this brilliant and betrodden young man whose destiny was thrusting him toward the darkness when his soul was made for light.It's not often I come across a novel that I enjoy as much as I enjoyed this.  It was a pleasure to read it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A must-read."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I could easily be accused of writing a review without reading the book, and that is true.  I didn't get past page 16.  The bottom line is the writing is absolutely juvenile.  If you are OK with reading incomplete sentences as well as those awkwardly worded, this could be a book for you.  Could easily be written by a 12 year old.  The fact that this book received a Pulitzer Prize is simply more evidence that where goes art, goes civilization.  And Western Civilization has jettisoned good standards and reason.  Sad."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I had purchased this book a couple years ago after hearing a friend rave about it. I love historical fiction, particularly books that take place during WWII, and this sounded like an excellent choice. I've been a bit busy raising my twins so I didn't read it right away but decided recently to read it since I was in the mood for a long novel!All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr is a fiction novel about a young French girl named Marie-Laure and a teenage German boy named Werner whose lives become intertwined during the war. Marie-Laure experienced disintegrating blindness when she was six years old and now has to learn to navigate the war-ridden world using a wooden model of their neighborhood that her father builds. Werner is incredibly intelligent and can dismantle receivers and put them back together again. He knows how things work and can solve complicated mathematical equations. His abilities catch the attention of the German soldiers who have him enlist so he can fight against the resistance. Their stories come together to create a beautiful tale.It took me about two weeks to read this book and I really enjoyed it! It's intelligently-written and one you will want to ponder when you set it down. Many of the chapters are only a couple pages long and each chapter switches points-of-view. It's fairly easy to follow even though the narrators change so frequently. There are also several sections of the book, separated by dates, months, or years.The reason I gave this novel four stars is because, even though it's incredibly well-written, there are some parts that drag. Don't get me wrong, this book is very detailed and I love the classical works of fiction that Marie-Laure reads and the ways those books tie into the rest of the novel. There were just some parts that I found to be slow-moving so I didn't get to read that much that day but other days, I tore through it so that definitely made up for those other days!Overall, I liked this novel and definitely feel it's worth it to read it, especially if you enjoy historical fiction novels set during WWII. It's intelligently-written so you will want to be ready to do some thinking while reading this book. Parts of it dragged for me but it was mostly a quick read. I'm glad I finally read it and recommend it if you are looking for a thick novel to dive into!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This story is written so well that it pulls you in and you\u2019ll feel \u201csurrounded\u201d by Doerr\u2019s rich narrative. It\u2019s so good that you\u2019ll put the book down just to prolong the experience."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "In spite of its stellar reviews, I found this book painfully predictable. Has a character appeared who elicits your sympathy? Know that they will soon suffer a terrible fate. Little girl innocently playing? Turn a few pages and she'll be dead. Sensitive intellectual? Of course, he'll be bullied and suffer. Cruelty, inhumanity, it all falls into the slots of expected stereotypes. I'll spare you spoilers.Yet after all that, I have no doubt that I could do no better, so I take my hat off to the author and bow in respect."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent story telling.

When she is six, Marie-Laure goes blind and her father builds a perfect miniature of their neighborhood so she can memorize it by touch and navigate her way home. When she is twelve, the Nazis occupy Paris and father and daughter flee to the walled citadel of Saint-Malo, where Marie-Laure\u2019s reclusive great-uncle lives in a tall house by the sea. With them they carry what might be the museum\u2019s most valuable and dangerous jewel.\r\n\r\nIn a mining town in Germany, the orphan Werner grows up with his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find. Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing these crucial new instruments, a talent that wins him a place at a brutal academy for Hitler Youth, then a special assignment to track the resistance. More and more aware of the human cost of his intelligence, Werner travels through the heart of the war and, finally, into Saint-Malo, where his story and Marie-Laure\u2019s converge.\r\n\r\nDoerr\u2019s \u201cstunning sense of physical detail and gorgeous metaphors\u201d (San Francisco Chronicle) are dazzling. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, he illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another.
