Except for the self-sacrifice of the mysterious female poet described at the end, though actually occurring earlier in the timeline of the novel, the bohemian characters do not seem to have grown much; making the reader think that that incident is unremarkably like all others in their drug-addled world. The would-be poets in this novel have little commitment to their art and constantly put down greater artists than themselves in trying to create a \"movement\" that seems to be a substitute for their feeble political activities. In this sense, the novel is really an excoriation of a certain class of Latin American \"activist\" and is reminiscent of their norteno compatriots who marched for civil rights in the Sixties, while presenting themselves as the next wave of American artists. Didn't they all end up working on Wall Street?"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of the best books I have ever read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I liked it, and I don't know why I liked it, which doesn't matter much anyway, period.
