The more I listened about one of the great politicians of the Roman Empire, Marcus Cicero, known as one of the greatest orators of all time, I the more I thought that no matter how fast we can travel and how many fancy toys and gadgets we can buy, humans haven\u2019t evolved at all. The politics, manipulation, backstabbing that Marcus Cicero dealt with and had to survive is no different from world politics today and especially as rotten as Washington DC with Donald Trump in the White House and the GOP controlling both Houses of Congress, the U.S. Supreme Court, and the presidency.  Corruption and bribery ruled the Roman Empire and it still rules the United States today. Rome was ruled by the rich and powerful by fooling and manipulating Roman citizens just like the U.S. is ruled today.

Or maybe you have already decided to read both books, but you are wondering which one to read first.  Both of them are first-rate books of historical fiction.Colleen McCullough\u2019s book is the initial book of a seven-volume series.  It is 750 pages, meticulously-researched, and very scholarly.  The book\u2019s action covers the period from 110 BCE to 100 BCE.  You will come away from this erudite novel feeling much smarter than before, and much more knowledgeable about Marius, Sulla and the politics and political machinations of the Late Republic.  It will stand the test of time and will surely be read by students of the Classics for decades.  As a book that brings to life the Roman world, I cannot imagine that it could ever be surpassed.Robert Harris\u2019s book is the initial book of a three-volume series.  It is 300 pages, also assiduously-researched and covers the life and times of Cicero, specifically the period from 79 BCE to 64 BCE.  (The later years of his life are covered in books two and three of the series.)  Harris's book is refreshingly written in the first person, relatively unusual for historical fiction.  It is part detective story, part courtroom drama and part political intrigue.  The narrative is electrifying, the style is fast-paced, and starting from the very first page I had a difficult time putting the book down.Which one should you read first, Harris or McCullough?

The re-creation of a vanished biography written by his household slave and righthand man, Tiro, Imperium follows Cicero\u2019s extraordinary struggle to attain supreme power in Rome.\r\n\r\nOn a cold November morning, Tiro opens the door to find a terrified, bedraggled stranger begging for help. Once a Sicilian aristocrat, the man was robbed by the corrupt Roman governor, Verres, who is now trying to convict him under false pretenses and sentence him to a violent death. The man claims that only the great senator Marcus Cicero, one of Rome\u2019s most ambitious lawyers and spellbinding orators, can bring him justice in a crooked society manipulated by the villainous governor. But for Cicero, it is a chance to prove himself worthy of absolute power. \r\n\r\nWhat follows is one of the most gripping courtroom dramas in history, and the beginning of a quest for political glory by a man who fought his way to the top using only his voice\u2014defeating the most daunting figures in Roman history.", "asin": "0743498666", "rank": "52423", "city": "Rome", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WftDWNXLL.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
