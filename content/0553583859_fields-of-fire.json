War is awful, but that doesn't mean it's descriptions need to be. This book is hundreds of pages of bland, awkward, disjointed prose, that glorifies and condemns the horrors and heroism, respectively, in the Vietnam war. The writing is painfully mediocre right up to the last few chapters, where it redeems itself a little. The only chapter worth reading is chapter 31, so if you ignore my advice and get this book, but find yourself disliking it as much as I did, skip to 31 and move on with your life."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent read"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a powerful Vietnam statement.  It has something for everyone, whether you were for \u201cit\u201d or against \u201cit\u201d. The author, a Vietnam vet, gives an interesting twist to the typical war novel.  His characters are very real and at the same time a cross section of faces and personalities of servicemen whether at a time of war or at peace.  Sensitive \u201csnowflakes\u201d will be shocked by the raw descriptions of war in its grunginess but in the end, and the author truly ends the novel with a flourish, servicemen come across simply as human beings caught up in uncontrollable situations that bring the best and worst out of each one.  For those of us who served in the \u201cVietnam\u201d era, it is a startling realization that those of us who for one reason or another did not go to \u2018Nam were very fortunate indeed. To those who did, I salute you!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I read this book twice when it came out years ago.
