I was fully enthralled & engaged with the book, but was exhausted by its slow - make it snail pace. The plot advances so slowly like a wave in the middle of the ocean. I am calling it quits at 40%, but with the feeling that author shortcoming are way outweighed by her ability to plot characters (and stick with them, even when I forgot about them because they disappeared for a long while they come back with next appearance). A talent to reckon with back in '99 God knows where she is placed now. Her style seemed to follow Kundera a bit, even in her choice of characters.

But the truth is that Zadie Smith\u2019s voice is remarkably, fluently, and altogether wonderfully her own.\r\n\r\nAt the center of this invigorating novel are two unlikely friends, Archie Jones and Samad Iqbal. Hapless veterans of World War II, Archie and Samad and their families become agents of England\u2019s irrevocable transformation. A second marriage to Clara Bowden, a beautiful, albeit tooth-challenged, Jamaican half his age, quite literally gives Archie a second lease on life, and produces Irie, a knowing child whose personality doesn\u2019t quite match her name (Jamaican for \u201cno problem\u201d). Samad\u2019s late-in-life arranged marriage (he had to wait for his bride to be born), produces twin sons whose separate paths confound Iqbal\u2019s every effort to direct them, and a renewed, if selective, submission to his Islamic faith. \r\n\r\nSet against London\u2019s racial and cultural tapestry, venturing across the former empire and into the past as it barrels toward the future, White Teeth revels in the ecstatic hodgepodge of modern life, flirting with disaster, confounding expectations, and embracing the comedy of daily existence.", "asin": "0375703861", "rank": "12209", "city": "London", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515SYDLdnKL.jpg", "country": "England", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
