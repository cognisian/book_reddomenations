In a nutshell, this is the story of a man-child who is lazy, romantic and pathetic - not only in his love life but also his larger life.  The romance is entirely self-directed, which is why Rob is such a pathetic character.  It works because it is funny and the author makes you believe that this guy and his sad excuse for a life could actually exist.Rob is thirty-five going on twenty.  His is a character that one feels flashes of sympathy for, but not as often as one wants to kick him in the rear and tell him to grow up and get a life that exists at least some of the time out of his head.  (I read this long after seeing the movie and I must say that John Cusack does a brilliant job of bringing Rob to life on the big screen).Rob's existential crisis revolves around women and his inability to sustain a good relationship.  They always leave him (for the most part) and he has no clue that this is just how some relationships end or that he is usually the author of his own rejection.  The book revolves around Rob's listing of his five most searing break-ups and his attempt to reconnect with his former flings to answer the question \"why?\"  The larger story is Rob himself and the departure of Laura, the most significant love of his life who has just moved out after sharing a flat (this takes place in London) with him for years.  Rob's day job, a fantasy small business where he indulges his preoccupation with pop music and a snobbish world view driven by other's appreciation of the \"right\" or \"wrong\" songs, is as much of a disaster as his love life.Nick Hornby mines both lives for a lot of laughs.  His writing is funny and descriptive and one gets to know Rob well (though one does not like Rob at all).  This book had a lot of laugh out loud moments.  I suspect there might be a little bit of Rob in a lot of guys - though I think maturity and living help stamp out the narcissism and utter self-absorption in those of us who go on to enjoy at least a modest success in our romantic and other lives.  There is a lot to be said for growing up and learning - one is unsure if Rob will really embrace those concepts while reading this enjoyable book."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Rob\u2019s life is almost as erratic as his failed relationships - from the one with his mother, to his long list of girlfriends, to his high tolerance of his downright rude employees/friends at his vinyl record shop. The incident where one of them chases a customer out of the shop simply for asking for a record he considers in bad taste would be funny if it weren\u2019t so intolerant.Rob falls in and out of love at equal speed and his conquests usually desert him rather than the other way around, leaving him constantly pitying himself. He is one mixed up person.The author\u2019s \u2018stream of consciousness\u2019 writing style made it difficult to follow the threads of the plot, but as a movie was based on the book, I can\u2019t help feeling I must have missed something important.I rate it 2,5 stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "For most people I think that the beginning of the book would probably bounce around to much for them.
