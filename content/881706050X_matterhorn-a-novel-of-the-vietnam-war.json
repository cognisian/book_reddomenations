I respect his service and ability to complete an operation in spite of having to follow orders from an incompetent and usually drunk Commander that used Bravo Company casualties to build his resume. It was infuriating.The colorful illustrations and recollections behind the Thousand Yard Stare were memorable.The depiction of black soldiers was condescending and cliche. Every black soldier was gun smuggling, drug dealing, drug using, jive talking or murdering a fellow Marine in his sleep by \u201cfragging\u201d. Their  dialogue was difficult to read and even less believable. Some of the \u201cyou be\u201d, \u201cwe be\u201d dialogue was reminiscent of Mrs. Clever\u2019s jive talking scene in the movie Airplane, less the humor.Compared to the very detailed descriptions of carnage, puss oozing jungle rot and dehydrated/starving Marines licking morning dew from their ponchos while manning their fighting holes, the black soldier character depiction was lost in Marlante\u2019s translation. It looked conjured.Allowing the fragging Murder of a close friend  to go uninvestigated as an \u201caccidental death\u201d, I just don\u2019t get. Maybe, Marlantes, I mean Mellas was worried that he would become an accidental death in Bravo company\u2019s next operation. I\u2019m still trying to figure it out.A very fictional sequel to Matterhorn, elaborating on a cold fragging Murder investigation  might make for an interesting read or movie."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great book, worth the time to read."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The story of US Marines Bravo Company attack of (fictional) Matterhorn mountain, Eiger hill, and Sky Cap landing zone in 1967. Shows the lunacy of the attack orders based on commanders' ambition for career advancement (getting a higher body count of dead North Vietnamese soldiers than the body count of dead US Marines).

He has yet to read it.  I chose it from the bookshelf a few days ago, and I was immediately transported back in time to 1966 when I was waiting on pins and needles for the next letter from my newlywed husband in Vietnam.  His letters would arrive covered in red dirt and would contain stories so like those in this book. Like Lt. Mellas, he spent his time in Vietnam in the \"bush.\"  No one who hasn't walked in their shoes can truly understand what these men (teens and early 20's) went through.Marlantes is an incredibly gifted writer.  Action just blasts off his pages.  He has introduced a remarkable hero, one who is flawed, terribly frightened, and yet is unwittingly courageous.  He is honest and compassionate.  Mellas's experiences will bring you both heartsickness and hilarity.  While I did not want to put it down, I did not want to end it.This book is one I will never forget.  It's a keeper.  I will reread it  in a few years.  Buy this book.  Once you open it, forget about any projects you have planned."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Painful, beautiful, frightening all at the same time. Every word, every page skillfully depicts the unvarnished and unique experience of Marines, in and out of battle.  You are transported to a time and place few of us wish to remember, exposed to the raw terror, boredom, and the consequence of  battle decisions driven by ego and career advancement that defined this war, and likely every war."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a moderately lengthy, but gripping, readable novel about the United States Marines In Viet Nam in the late 1960s.  The novel is semi biographical in that the author was a Marine platoon lieutenant in Viet Nam during the time frame of the novel.  There were times the action was quite intense and I could not put the book down until a chapter was over.In the past I had made a study of semi biographical novels written by American Veterans after World War II.  Some are well known, some, not so much.  I had read numerous such novels.  At this moment, I do have to say that I liked this novel more than any of them.  This may be because I am from the Viet Nam era.  However, I greatly admired the efforts and sacrifices of the so called \"greatest generation\".  I think it is simply that this is an extremely well written novel.The author attended Yale University and then served in the Marine Corps in Viet Nam.  Of the novels I alluded to above, this novel most put me in mind of \"The Naked And The Dead\" by Norman Mailer, who attended Harvard and then served in the Pacific Theater.  However I strongly preferred \"Matterhorn\" to the Mailer novel.  Neither of these novels involve unadulterated \"flag waving\".  However I found \"Matterhorn\" to be more balanced and the Mailer novel more dark.  Although celebrated, personally I did not care for \"The Naked And The Dead\".On the other hand, Leon Uris also wrote a semi biographical novel about the Marines in the Pacific in World War II, \"Battle Cry\".  While a good novel, Leon Uris was a much younger, less sophisticated writer when he wrote \"Battle Cry\".  Hence \"Battle Cry\" is a more positive, but less mature novel than \"Matterhorn\".  Of course Leon Uris went on to become an really excellent author.As is common for me, I read this novel on Kindle while simultaneously listening to this novel on audiobook.  The narrator was Bronson Pinchot.  Mister Pinchot's narration was excellent and added to my reading enjoyment.  However I also needed to read the novel visually due to a lot of scenic descriptions as well as the expected informal jargon that was used by the characters.In summary I found this to be an excellent reading experience.  As far as a semi autobiographical war novel by an American Service Veteran, this may be my favorite.

It is the timeless story of a young Marine lieutenant, Waino Mellas, and his comrades in Bravo Company, who are dropped into the mountain jungle of Vietnam as boys and forced to fight their way into manhood. \r\n\r\nStanding in their way are not merely the North Vietnamese but also monsoon rain and mud, leeches and tigers, disease and malnutrition. Almost as daunting, it turns out, are the obstacles they discover between each other: racial tension, competing ambitions, and duplicitous superior officers. But when the company finds itself surrounded and outnumbered by a massive enemy regiment, the Marines are thrust into the raw and all-consuming terror of combat. The experience will change them forever.\r\n\r\nMatterhorn is a visceral and spellbinding novel about what it is like to be a young man at war. It is an unforgettable novel that transforms the tragedy of Vietnam into a powerful and universal story of courage, camaraderie, and sacrifice: a parable not only of the war in Vietnam but of all war, and a testament to the redemptive power of literature.", "asin": "881706050X", "rank": 0, "city": "Ho Chi Minh City", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ywkakMdvL.jpg", "country": "Hanoi", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
