In the novel, the main character, Paul, tells his life story from the cradle to the grave, and describes how the shadow of mental illness falls over his life as the innocence of childhood slips away. Although the novel describes the bitterness of Paul\u2019s fate, it is also very humorous. One of the novel\u2019s greatest strengths is its narrative balance between moments of hilarity and bitter sadness. \r\n\r\nIn 1995, Einar M\u00e1r Gu\u00f0mundsson was awarded the Nordic Council Literary Prize for Angels of the Universe. The novel has been translated into nearly 30 languages and has awoken much interest around the world and received excellent reviews. The film by Fri\u00f0rik \u00de\u00f3r Fri\u00f0riksson based on the novel has also enjoyed great popularity.", "asin": "9979323124", "rank": "2321556", "city": "Reykjavik", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51tZT53JwPL.jpg", "country": "Iceland", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
