It is, simply and explicitly, porn!  He got paid a dollar a page for writing this. Back then, before porn dvd's and the Internet, you could buy the basic, soft core mags, available at any news stand, or go to the porn store and get the \"hard stuff' (pun accidental but I like it) like the mags imported from Sweden and reel to reel porn movies (without sound!) . There were also paperback books, which were just an excuse for something \"dirty\" to read. The stories were written by men with very little talent as writers. It was just a way to make a few bucks. This is what Henry Miller has written here. A \"dirty\" book. Except that the man was talented as hell and couldn't help writing LITERATURE. This is Miller at his raunchiest and least reserved (if you could ever call him reserved). From the first page he gets you into the most outrageous sexual situations. It's all in here - and more!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "When you stop and look, or read, you'll notice that Henry Miller writes sex (not about sex), it's not in a candid, matter of fact way. When he writes sex, things are blowing up, planets are falling out of orbit and crashing into each other...what is going on? This isn't erotica in any ordinary sense, this is Miller crashing through our culture. Is it perverted, obscene? Yes. Is it well written? Of course. Is it nuts? You better believe it! Only Romance of Lust, an Anonymously written book, comes close to the lustful zaniness of Under the Roofs of Paris, and even that falls short to Miller's talent. Highly recommended."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The inspiration to all the erotica I'll ever write. This book is so good.

I have a hard time with Miller's portrayal of women as just \"c__ts\" as he calls each and every one it seems. I kept an open mind as best that I could and read a good portion, but it was repetitive and crude.
