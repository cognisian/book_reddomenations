The subject is amazing.  I am always shocked when I read about different cultures who treat their women worse than they do their animals. But, I must admit, this is the first time I have heard of parents giving their children mean or cruel names. Who names their daughter Regret?  When will people realize that if they didn't have girl children, there would be no boy children?  This book is well worth the read.

As for me, my parents named me Regret.\"\r\n\r\nHonolulu is the rich, unforgettable story of a young \"picture bride\" who journeys to Hawai'i in 1914 in search of a better life.\r\n\r\nInstead of the affluent young husband and chance at an education that she has been promised, she is quickly married off to a poor, embittered laborer who takes his frustrations out on his new wife. Renaming herself Jin, she makes her own way in this strange land, finding both opportunity and prejudice. With the help of three of her fellow picture brides, Jin prospers along with her adopted city, now growing from a small territorial capital into the great multicultural city it is today. But paradise has its dark side, whether it's the daily struggle for survival in Honolulu's tenements, or a crime that will become the most infamous in the islands' history...\r\n\r\nWith its passionate knowledge of people and places in Hawai'i far off the tourist track, Honolulu is most of all the spellbinding tale of four women in a new world, united by dreams, disappointment, sacrifices, and friendship.", "asin": "0312606346", "rank": "56860", "city": "Honolulu", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41wVrdoKZsL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
