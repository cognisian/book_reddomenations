Maybe someone else could appreciate the wishful deviation from history and what will assuredly be a miraculous recovery from the ending in the next book, but not me.

Unlike the previous installment, this book has a solid throughline. The plot makes for extraordinarily satisfying hurt/comfort--revolving around Laurence and Temeraire, but, unusually, also around other dragons and their captains; it's a welcome broadening of emotional investment, and works beautifully. This book also marks the series's first major departure from history (dragons aside, of course), and it's a telling change that directly addresses the racial issues that permeate the narrative. I was initially skeptical of the tendency to elide historical slavery and the fictional social role of dragons, but the way this development works, combined with increasingly diverse representation, specifically of Africans, goes a long way to resolving that. This series is super tropey, in its tone and relationships, which is what makes it so compulsively readable. But the underlying historical setting, with all its injustice and complication, tempers and enriches that tone. I'm remain in love with the series, but this volume in particular was fantastic. (And, that ending!)"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Naomi Novik has created an alternate history using the Napoleonic Wars and given us dragons.
