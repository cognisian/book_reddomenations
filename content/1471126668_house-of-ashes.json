However, as the author says, the action has much in common with attempted coups in other parts of the world, and (in my opinion) gives an insight into much of the unrest that is taking place all over the world today.The story starts as seen through the eyes of Ashes, a quiet studious family man. Ashes thinks that his religious \u201cLeader\u201d has many of the answers that he is seeking in life, so says \u201cyes\u201d when asked to participate in the coup, not quite understanding what he is agreeing to, but following his charismatic leader. Then one afternoon Ashes turns up to prayers, and by the time he leaves his life has changed for ever.As events unfold, not quite as the revolutionaries imagine, the action shifts to the House of Power \u2013 and the narrative moves between Ashes and Mrs Garland, Minister for the Environment, one of the hostages.The fears, emotions and doubts experienced by hostages and captors are portrayed expressively, and the action rises and falls according to what is going on inside the House, and what can be observed of the outside through the windows \u2013 at one stage Kate Adie is seen, so you know things are bad!At the end of the book the story is rounded off well.I found this a fascinating and gripping book. The perspective of Mrs Garland (hostage) was very thought provoking, and some of the conversations she has with the revolutionaries made me compare these fictional events to current world affairs. Her discussions about the realities of government, compared to the version fed to the young gunmen, and her thoughts as to what the future of these young impressionable men should be once the current events have run their course, are very thought provoking.Some of the characters appeared so seldom in the book, that I needed, on a few occasions, to flick back to check who they were, but that may say more about my memory for names than anything else! The author uses words peculiar to Trinidad in her writing, and it is a pity that these are not translated at the back of the book. However a quick internet search brings up definitions.For me this is a book that I will be thinking about for some time to come, and has certainly given me a new perspective on world events."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "If you\u2019ve ever listened to the Shooting the Poo podcast or spoken to my mate Dave, you\u2019ll know that I have a thing about Hollywood films based on true events.  No matter how well acted or directed the movie, I always experience a crushing sense of betrayal when I discover that the majority of the film, including a number of the pivotal scenes, were completely made-up.  You\u2019d think I\u2019d get over it and yet I keep asking myself the same question \u2013 why don\u2019t these movies just tell the truth?*The same question accompanied me as I read Monique Roffey\u2019s Costa Book Award nominated novel, House of Ashes.  In this case, though, it\u2019s not the lack of truth that\u2019s the issue, if anything it\u2019s Roffey\u2019s fidelity to history that weighs the book down.In the Author\u2019s Note she tells us that her story, about a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat on the fictional Caribbean Island of Sans Amen, may \u201cbear some relation to an attempted coup which took place in Trinidad and Tobago in 1990.\u201d  This is an understatement.  While the place names might have changed, and while characters like Ashes and Breeze and Aspasia Garland never existed, the historical beats \u2013 the year of the coup (1990), the takeover of the Government house and the island\u2019s one television station, the number of militants that were involved (114), the length of the coup (6 days), the looting that happened in Port-au-Prince during the crisis and the beating and shooting of the Prime Minister for ordering the army to attack with full force \u2013 are all accurately portrayed in the novel.This then raises the obvious question \u2013 why bother with an invented Caribbean island, why not just provide a historical, but fictional, account of the 1990 coup?Danuta Kean provides the answer in her July 2014 interview with Monique Roffey for The Independent.  She observes that,\"[Roffey\u2019s] nerves are not those of a media newbie. Instead they reflect a writer playing with fire\u2026 She glances around as if we are being watched. I look around too. Nervousness is infectious. Her paranoia is reasonable. The religious group behind the 1990 uprising remains active. She has no desire to be a female Salman Rushdie.\"Roffey then explains what prompted her to write the novel:\"\u201cI thought I was crazy to even contemplate writing about it,\u201d she admits. A year was spent talking it over with her psychoanalyst. What pushed the idea off the couch and on to the page was a Commission of Inquiry held in 2011. Its report was delivered in March 2012 and after that the words flew out of her. \u201cWriting wasn\u2019t the hard part,\u201d she says.\"Faced with the conflicting need to bring attention to the 1990 coup, while also protecting herself and her family, I can understand why Roffey made the artistic decision to set her story in Sans Amen. It\u2019s easy to argue that art should transcend issues of life and death.  History is littered with creative-types who\u2019ve endangered their lives for their work.  But when faced with potential death threats, I can absolutely appreciate why common sense might prevail.In anycase I doubt Roffey believes that she\u2019s comprised her work by changing place names and inventing characters.  The focus of House of Ashes is the message rather than the historical truth.  As she states in her Author\u2019s Note, \u201cthe events [detailed in the novel] may have much in common with coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in other parts of the world, for example Latin America, Europe or Africa.  While on the decline, the coup remains a common form of power change in the world.\u201d  And in line with that sentiment, the novel provides an interesting post-colonial critique, exploring the bad habits left over by colonial powers and the abuse of innocence, especially young, uneducated men living in poverty and looking for meaning and sense in their lives.Beyond the themes of the novel, the narrative is tense, gripping and confronting.  Roffey does an excellent job in detailing the adrenalin charged horror of the first moments of the coup and the mix of boredom, fear and loss of dignity that settles in once the food runs out and a corner of the room becomes a latrine.Throughout it all, though, the ghost of the 1990 coup lingers.  While it\u2019s clear that the militants overthrowing the Robinson Government are religious, Roffey never uses the words Islam or Muslim to describe their faith.  The fact that Roffey mutes this element means that there\u2019s this gaping hole in the novel that\u2019s never adequately explored.  It\u2019s sad because I would have loved to have seen Roffey apply her keen insight on the faith that motivated the militants.Unlike a Hollywood film, Roffey wants to give us a true accounting of what happened in Trinidad and Tobago in 1990 and why.  However, genuine fear of reprisal means that what could have been a powerful and relevant novel never fully comes together.  It\u2019s not an entirely hollow reading experience, but I do wish I lived in a time where art wasn\u2019t sometimes required to distance itself from the truth.* Yes, I know reality and history are messy and don\u2019t lend themselves to the neat narrative beats of a movie.  But that\u2019s what documentaries are for."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Oskar Pinkus is a Polish Jew who lived in Losice, located 85 miles east of Warsaw and 10 miles from the Bug River. In 1939-1940, after the German-Soviet conquest of Poland, Losice's Jews didn't believe in Hitler's threats (pp. 50-51). This further shows that the widespread Jewish-Communist collaboration of 1939 couldn't have been driven by fears of Nazi extermination.The Polish Blue Police (Policja Granatowa) was kept in the dark until the last moment before the August 1942 roundup of Losice's Jews (p. 106). The Germans also forced the local farmers to come with their carts (p. 106). (This corrects the misuse of a painting shown in the movie SHTETL, through which the viewer is misled into believing that the local farmers collaborated willingly in the roundup and transport of Bransk's Jews).  At Siedlce, 20 miles from Losice, the Ukrainian police took over (pp. 109-110), and both the Blue Police and Polish farmers were sent home. The Ukrainians and Germans loaded the Jews onto trains for their 60-mile trip to their deaths at Treblinka. At Siedlce, it was the Germans, not Poles, who were jeering the Jews: \"As the Jews passed, the Poles fell silent watching the procession of doomed men and women. The German soldiers who stood on the sidewalks commanded in sneering voices...: (pp. 109-110).Just before the roundup, Pinkus fled Losice. Throughout his treks, he was helped by Poles in numerous, successive occasions (p. 88, 90, 91,128, 129, 137, 212), including once by a Polish Blue Policeman (p. 87). This further proves that many Polish benefactors were necessary for the saving of even one Jew. Pinkus also mentions Poles who refused to help owing to the German-imposed death penalty for such acts (p. 89, 93, 133) and, unlike Jan Tomasz Gross, recognizes the legitimacy of this motive for Polish inaction (p. 119). However, Pinkus criticized overseas Jews for their lack of assistance (p. 119).Pinkus eventually found \"permanent\" lodging in a shelter underneath farmer Karbicki's barn. At first, Karbicki helped only because Pinkus paid him but, in time, became more altruistic (p. 199; \"But I can't keep you for nothing\", p. 220). The reader may exonerate Karbicki after considering his extreme poverty, which included tattered clothes and hole-ridden boots (p. 128; p. 153). (It is unfair that Poles who were paid to help Jews are deemed ineligible for the Yad Vashem medal, whereas Danes, who were incomparably better well-off under German occupation and yet took hefty fees for shipping Jews to Sweden, are eligible).At first, Pinkus praised the AK and commended it for assassinating Germans, spies, collaborators, and informers (pp. 195, 204), and for making the Germans fearful of entering the woods. As a result of all this, in 1943 the hidden Jews felt safer than ever (p. 196).In time, Pinkus left his shelter at Karbicki's farm and encountered other Jews in hiding in the forest or nearby farms. They assembled into a band that built an independent shelter within the forest, and that stole feedstuffs and livestock from Polish farmers (pp. 204-206). One may understand why Poles sometimes killed fugitive Jews.Pinkus then writes: \"Shymeluk had gone to Wolki for food one night and did not return. At first the farmers denied that he had even been in the village but eventually we learned that he had been killed by...the AK, the Polish underground. Shymeluk was in a farmer's house when the AK arrived. They took him with them, and although there was no direct proof that they killed him, it remained a fact that Shymeluk never returned from that trip.\" (p. 213). Obviously, Pinkus didn't see any of this, but was relying on someone else's statements (in other words, hearsay). Besides, could \"going for food\" include stealing? Finally, in any event, how could Pinkus know that Shymeluk's presumed death didn't occur sometime AFTER the latter's presumed contact with the AK?Interestingly, Pinkus' only clearly eyewitness experience with the AK was a positive one. The AK visited the area, forced all the Jews out of hiding, and, not only didn't harm them, but encouraged them (pp. 215-218).But later that night, the AK allegedly returned and \"without even looking\" threw grenades into the forest shelter in which the Jews had until recently been hiding (p. 218). Considering the darkness of the forest, and unless Pinkus was very close to the shelter (which he doesn't indicate), how could he possibly know such details? Besides, if the AK was out to kill Jews, why didn't it do so earlier that day, in broad daylight, when it had all the Jews gathered together?Skepticism is justified. The informed reader may recount Polish Jew Jerzy Kosinski's tall tales about Polish atrocities against Jews, exposed as such by independent investigation, or Yaffa Eliach's contradictory, fantastic account of her 7 year-old self counting the number of bullets fired by an AK soldier into her baby brother. (Who counts shots, and what AK soldier would waste multiple scarce bullets on an infant?)Pinkus even makes a Yaffa Eliach-like accusation of the AK having an order to kill all remaining Polish Jews. He admits the nonexistence of written evidence of it, yet says: \"But better evidence lies in their record of persistent and widespread murder...In 1945 alone, 352 Jews were murdered by the AK...\" (p. 226). What a non sequitur! A few hundred Jews killed, even if all correctly blamed on the AK, is hardly proof of an AK \"mini-Wannsee\" (Eliach's term). And 352 killed out of over 250,000 remaining Polish Jews would only mean that the AK did an atrociously poor job of it.Pinkus claims that, in March 1945, the AK killed 3 of the 20 surviving Jews of Losice (p. 226). This is a flat lie. The AK no longer existed then! It had already been disbanded by Leopold Okulicki, its final commander, in January 1945."}]}, "authors": ["Monique Roffey"], "isbn": "1471126668", "longitude": 0.0, "periods": ["1900s", "Recent
