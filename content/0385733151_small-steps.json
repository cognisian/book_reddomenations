But it's hard when you have a record and everyone expects the worst from you. The only person who believe in Armpit is Ginny, his ten-year-old disabled neighbor. Together, they are learning to take small steps.\r\n\r\n Armpit seems to be on the right path until X-Ray, a buddy from Camp Green Lake, comes up with a get-rich-quick scheme. X-Ray's plan leads to a chance encounter with teen pop sensation Kaira DeLeon, the Beyonc\u00e9 of her time, and suddenly Armpit's life spins out of control. Only one thing is certain: he'll never be the same again.\r\n\r\n Combining his signature wit with a unique blend of adventure and deeply felt characters, Sachar explores issues of race, the nature of celebrity, the invisible connections that shape a person's life, and what it takes to stay the course. Doing the right thing is never a wrong choice\u2014but always a small step in right direction.", "asin": "0385733151", "rank": "16685", "city": "Austin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BPn5eupVL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
