The word novel is problematic when discussing her fiction.  Much of it is short and this book is no exception clocking in at 144 pages.  I prefer to think of her work as essayistic and employing the fictional form.  We don\u2019t inhabit complex characters who grow over the journey of her novels.  Nor do we inhabit clearly delineated worlds full of smells and ambiance.Many like \u2018The Public Image\u2019 take a theme and explore it through a fictional lens.  Here the theme is the tension between a person and their projection.  Annabel is a journeyman actress whose career takes off unexpectedly when she plays a character called the \u2018English Tiger-Lady.\u2019She is married to Frederick whose own acting career languishes and he subsequently finds work as a screen writer but is jealous of his wife\u2019s fabulous career. He and his louche best friend Billy O\u2019Brien make cruel fun of Annabel\u2019s intelligence and acting while neither of them amount to much of anything.  They posit the question of whether Annabel\u2019s acting amounts to more than a native charisma that she doesn\u2019t interfere with.Throughout the novel the sense of Annabel both as a person and as a public persona flip back and forth in terms of emphasis and focus.  It isn\u2019t clear how many people in her life care about her as a person or vice a versa.  And Annabel only becomes something other than a public image when it comes to her baby who she clings to as a buffer and finally an escape.Is \u201cThe Public Image\u201d a good novel?  Not really but then I don\u2019t think it is meant to be that.  Instead it is an exploration of personality, image and projections.  What do we really know about a person, even someone we think we know well?  People are like quicksilver and behavior you think means one thing means something entirely different to the person in question.The key to understand Spark I believe is her authorial voice.  It is ever assured and in command.  It tells you that no nonsense will be allow in terms of what we know about the plot, the characters and the meaning.  Sure there will be ambiguity and fun but don\u2019t expect hand holding or plaudits for understanding the story.  There is more to her fiction but she will make the reader find it."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The fairly short novella The Public Image (1968) about the difficulties faced by the modestly talented actress Annabel Christopher to maintain her public image in the face of her husband\u2019s malicious attempt to bring her down as part of his suicide, is fairly readable, especially toward the end, where it really takes off. The whole story takes place in Italy amidst its virulent paparazzi culture that kept reminding me of La Dolce Vita: Annabel even gets her first burst of on-screen fame by cavorting in a Roman fountain a la Anita Ekberg.I liked that author Muriel Spark doesn\u2019t simply default to the cheap and easy \u201ceveryone\u2019s corrupt\u201d tack, which tends to color many chronicles of show biz life. In fact, one fairly minor but critical character who you\u2019d think would act\u2014very understandably\u2014in an acquisitive way, doesn\u2019t, catalyzing a wonderful dramatic climax. I was going to give this a basic three-star review as a mildly entertaining portrayal of image manipulation games in the mass media world, but the last few chapters bumped it up by giving it a totally unexpected and satisfying twist."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "God, what a boring, awful book. John Lydon, in a second rubbish book credited to him but undoubtedly written by somebody else, says he borrowed the title of Spark's thumb-sucker for the name of his post-Pistols band. Big deal. Sparks strong-arms the phrase \"public image\" into almost every third paragraph here, trying hard to make some sort of point. The main character, a Brit actress stuck in Rome with a husband who ends up offing his damn fool self by jumping from a tourist site, is a predictably repressed tea-swilling bore. I hated this book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The Public Image by Muriel Spark (1969; Virago edition 1979) is a compact story about an actress and her public image. The men in her life \u2013 her husband, her producer, and her husband\u2019s friend \u2013 spend much of their time managing her public image. The story is set in Rome."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The noted academic & novelist Pamela Hansford Johnston wrote The Unspeakable Skipton in 1959, when the world was a very different place. I first read the book about 20 years ago, and again this week. I enjoyed it greatly both times.Although it is part of a loose trilogy, it is complete in itself.The novel certainly doesn't appear anti-feminist to me. Indeed, most of the male characters are shown to be more or less incompetent rogues completely without awareness of any kind - especially self-awareness. The ladies are treated relatively generously, to my mind. And if the Australian woman poet is based on the person that I suspect, then she has got off very lightly indeed!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The late Muriel Spark's 'The Public Image' (1968) was the author's second attempt, after the cumbersome 'The Mandelbaum Gate' (1965), to write a successful novel in a radically different mode from that of the highly satirical comic style which made her career.Though Spark's early novels, including 'The Comforters' (1957), 'Memento Mori' (1959), 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' (1961), and 'The Girls of Slender Means' (1963) were both critically and commercially popular, some reviewers came to perceive those novels--and Spark's literary talent--as both \"miniaturist\" and \"twee.\" After 'The Girls of Slender Means,' Spark embarked on a long series of experimental works, not completely returning to her former high style until 'Loitering with Intent' (1981) thirteen long years later.Set in Rome, where Spark was then living, 'The Public Image' is the comparatively simple story of Annabel Christopher, a young actress of average appearance and apparently minor talent who, by some strange cinemagraphic alchemy, transforms into an object of mystery and allure when photographed through the camera of rising Italian film director Luigi Leopardi. Promoted first as a \"Cat-Tiger\" and then as \"the English Lady-Tiger,\" Annabel eventually becomes internationally famous as \"the Lady Tiger\" solely on the basis of her unexpected and newly-manifested screen persona.Spark is ruthless in her early depiction of Annabel: not only is Annabel \"a puny little thing,\" \"a little slip of a thing,\" \"a little chit of a thing,\" and \"mousy,\" she is also \"stupid,\" and openly mocked as such by her lazy, frustrated, and pretentious husband, Frederick, who resents her sudden success, and his best friend, perpetual lay-about Billy O'Brien, both of whom continually taunt Annabel even while allowing her to financially support them in high style.Annabel, who completely lacks the maliciousness of those in her immediate circle, realizes and accepts that she is neither inherently intelligent nor well-educated. However, the hard-working actress carefully maintains her public image not because she is vain, but because she clearly understands that the deception is essential to her continued success in films. Increasingly practical and imbued with the kind of common sense Frederick and Billy lack, at no time does Annabel come to believe the publicity aggressively put forward by the studio.After giving birth to her first child, Annabel slowly comes to realize what is authentically important in her life, even as the destructive forces around her marshal to precipitate her public humiliation and ruin. Though the meaning of the book's climax and final paragraph have been disputed its publication, Annabel's fate is essentially a positive one. Annabel, a kind of slimmer, prettier Mary McGregor and a thus very unlikely Spark heroine, grows and evolves.Spark maintained meticulous control over her own occasionally glamorous public image throughout her lifetime, and thus it's no wonder that she chose to essay the theme in a full-length work.After the enormous success of her first seven novels, Spark suffered through a fairly notorious episode of professional envy at the hands of one-time friend and coauthor Derek Stanford, an episode that provided creative fuel for her last great novel, 'A Far Cry From Kensington' (1988), and which she addressed autobiographically in 'Curriculum Vitae' (1992).At the time of the writing of 'The Public Image,' Stanford's initial published salvos were no doubt still fresh in Spark's mind, which perhaps explain the novel's steely preoccupation with commercial personae, ambition and a professional envy so personally devastating that it erupts into rage, hatred, and both literal and figurative self-destruction."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Daniel Skipton, a British writer of limited talent and possibly even more limited success, pretends to himself and the world that he is a great writer.  He is, in fact, a liar, a chiseler, a boor, and a swindler, as his conduct over the week or so covered in this novel demonstrates.Skipton is ruined in the end, of course.  I do think that the novel had been better had any of the major characters been at all sympathetic; as it is, only Lotte, Skipton's landlady's daughter, who knits socks for him and brings his meals to his room is at all appealing."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I am a bit reluctant to express an opinion about this short but deeply satisfying novel, first published in 1968, because it does not seem to me to be a satire. I can see that perhaps _The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie_ is a  satire, and _The Abbess of Crewe_ surely is. Most of Spark's work is short  and has considerable bit. She herself labeled _The Public Image_ \"an  ethical shocker,\" but I'm even less sure of what that means than I am  whether the book is intended to satirize or portray a rising film star  whose public image is threatened. I also don't agree with the  cover description of Annabel having \"made the fatal mistake of  believing her public image.\" It seems to me that she knows what that  image is and how to maintain it and recognizes the rewards she reaps from  it, but that she has not confused her self with her image/typical role. The two main adult female characters are admirably poised and  fully ethical. The two main male characters are needy, greedy heels jealous  of Annabel's success. There is a harridan female child and some  professionally supportive males (a director and a lawyer), so it's not  entirely women good men bad, but the bad men are very destructive indeed. The local (Roman) color is amusing and the ending is very  satisfying. Also I read the book from cover-to-cover in less time than a  recording of Puccini's \"Turandot.\""}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I can understand why this book is not particularly popular; it is certainly not the first book one should read of Johnson. But it does have its moments, and could reasonably compare to humorous genre fiction and  light romance. But if you can get into it, it's not so bad, and I for one  was not offended by it."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "As a feminist I found this book troubling. Ms Johnson's humor is unimpressive, and her narrative will prove offensive to most women who believe that males are making women's writing somehow secondary and unimportant.
