Miller's book provides an insightful guie by indirection. He is a detective on the trail of the somewhat elusive Panama hat (they are all made in Ecuador, not Panama). Following Miller around Ecuador in search of the hat - the straw, the weavers, the  Indio communities where the weavers live, the rural towns where buyers acquire the hat bodies from the Indios, the city of Cuenca where the hats are finished - introduced me to this varied country. Miller goes everywhere, and has a convenient map so readers can follow his footsteps. I read this book with a recent guide book in one hand, so I learned quite a bit as I read.Like so many books (and movies) this one is something of a Jewish story. (I think this is because so many writers and film makers, and those in their markets, are Jewish). After the Russian pogroms during and after WWI, and after the holocaust, some Jews migrated to South America - though very few to Ecuador. But those who did - perhaps not unsurprisingly - went into the local clothing industry and that industry happens to be panama hats. So in passing readers are treated to an interesting story about interesting and enterprising families."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Miller has created an easy way to learn about the history and people of Ecuador.

It\u2019s a captivating story of cultures in collision, raw capitalism, and an exotic, humorous journey.\r\n\r\nThough offering perhaps more about Panama hats than the reader might ever want to know, this is a satisfying travel book that tells much else about Ecuador and its peoples. The growing, harvesting, and processing of straw, the weaving of it, the finishing of the hats, exportation, and all the bartering along the way is the glue that holds this book together. \r\n\r\nVisiting the countryside and towns such as Quito, Guayaquil, Lago Agrio, and Jipijapa (\"among the ugliest towns south of the equator\"), Miller tells us, among other things, about the Indians and their sad centuries-long plight, expatriates, illegal Ecuadorian emigration to the United States, precarious third-class Andean bus trips, the small Jewish community, and a wild and tragic Corpus Christi fiesta.", "asin": "0792263863", "rank": "1251060", "city": "Quito", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51M96HFGH0L.jpg", "country": "Panama", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
