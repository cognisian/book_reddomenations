The bridge in Ivo Andri\u0107\u2019s novel The Bridge Over the Drina needs no history lesson, for it has been a witness to history over centuries in Vi\u0161egrad in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. Perhaps the only true constant is the solid presence of the bridge that links the novel\u2019s stories across the centuries. Rather than relating the history of the town on cultural or societal level, Andri\u0107 paints a picture of the town throughout the 400-year span of the book through the lives of its inhabitants from the construction of the bridge under Ottoman rule to the departure of the Austro-Hungarians at the beginning of World War I.Andri\u0107 focuses more on the bridge and the changing lives of the town through short narratives. The result is a lack of real character development beyond short sketches of people\u2019s lives, which often end tragically. However, this structure allows him to cover a greater time period than the typical novel, which provides more insight into the town\u2019s history and the ways in which societal change impacts the lives of individuals. Though the book can be confusing at points due to Andri\u0107\u2019s jumps back and forth in the timeline, it still produces captivating snapshots of life in the Western Balkans throughout their occupation."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Central Europe has a complex history.

Andric skillfully spans three centuries of the bridge and its effect on the area and its peoples. A confluence of urban and rural and Turkey and Hungary and Austria, and Jew and Muslim and Christian.and various Balkan communities.A full plate indeed. All this interplay is masterfully crafted through a variety of individual and community stories. I read it in two sessions having to pause to reflect and consider so many issues that are raised. I have already recommended this to four friends. I wonder what I miss in translation,but I am glad to have read it. Double glad that read a book from apart of the world with which I was unfamiliar. Though from a time past I found many issues germane to our current time.

As we seek to make sense of the current nightmare in this region, this remarkable, timely book serves as a reliable guide to its people and history.\r\n\r\n\"No better introduction to the study of Balkan and Ottoman history exists, nor do I know of any work of fiction that more persuasively introduces the reader to a civilization other than our own. It is an intellectual and emotional adventure to encounter the Ottoman world through Andric's pages in its grandiose beginning and at its tottering finale. It is, in short, a marvelous work, a masterpiece, and very much sui generis. . . . Andric's sensitive portrait of social change in distant Bosnia has revelatory force.\" William H.
