The book is told as a series of interviews with the inhabitants of an apartment building where a man was murdered. Each chapter is an interview with another character and each character is helplessly and humanly limited in their scope.  Every one is so self involved that each could be describing a separate planet. The seeds of racism are exposed as each character hilariously misinterprets the other's actions to fit with their view of the world. The misinterpretations are so hilarious and careless that the reader can't help but notice and laugh at his or her own tendencies.TLDR; a quick and light read that will make you think more about the 'strange' person living next to you."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Arrived safely and on time.

But Amara Lakhous scores ten for ten in this original social satire about the inability of disparate Roman neighbors to melt in the pot.  A body lying dead in an apartment building elevator evokes impassioned testimony by a dozen people who know some of the story of the crime but have wildly varying interpretations of what happened.

An investigation ensues and as each of the victim's neighbors is questioned, the reader is offered an all-access pass into the most colorful neighborhood in contemporary Rome. Each character takes his or her turn center-stage, giving evidence, recounting his or her story the dramas of racial identity, the anxieties and misunderstandings born of a life spent on society's margins, the daily humiliations provoked by mainstream culture's fears and indifference, preconceptions and insensitivity. What emerges is a moving story that is common to us all, whether we live in Italy or Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nThis novel is animated by a style that is as colorful as the neighborhood it describes and is characterized by seemingly effortless equipoise that borrows from the cinematic tradition of the Commedia all Italiana as exemplified by directors such as Federico Fellini. \r\n\r\nAt the heart of this bittersweet comedy told with affection and sensitivity is a social reality that we often tend to ignore and an anthropological analysis, refreshing in its generosity, that cannot fail to fascinate.", "asin": "1933372613", "rank": "328332", "city": "Rome", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519yfpTK6WL.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
