I was really impressed with this book - it is beautifully laid out softcover book with copious color maps from various periods in the Vancouver history.  Each page has one or more maps and large amounts of text describing the maps and the history of the area.  It's an interesting approach to the history of a location by using maps (some actually used and others never followed) to really let the story of Vancouver emerge.This is a larger sized softcover book but the inside presentation is very creative - at no time do you feel like you a reading a textbook.  Photographs from the era are welcome additions to further detail the antique maps.In all, I felt I had a great grasp of the fascinating history of Vancouver and was very pleased to receive this as a present.  It really is a gorgeous book, beautifully presented, richly detailed, and very informative."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "In the text there are more than 370 original maps charting the growth and development of the Vancouver region from the years of discovery and exploration.
