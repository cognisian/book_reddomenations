Sarah Bensimon is a young Parisian Jew who marries into an orthodox family and takes refuge in her kitchen, recreating a kosher version of classic French cuisine. The third woman is madame Jeanne Proust herself, fragments of whose 'diaries' are recreated with impeccably researched detail - as she worries about Marcel, his late-night habits, his diet and his unsuitable friends.\r\n\r\nAll these strands are brought poignantly together - the new world and the old, the Seine and the St Lawrence, mothers and sons, outsiders and insiders - in this intelligent and beautifully judged debut novel.", "asin": "0099441985", "rank": "3024035", "city": "Toronto", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-k4uFnkgL.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
