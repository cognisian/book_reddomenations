He sets this conflict up but then the main figure representing the Noble Savage dies of malaria?  Seems like James didn't know how to finish this, or treats the Noble Savage idea as a fancy that just leads to an early death. James cheated the reader in the end, he did not finish it. Or maybe he did...If the story is about WInterbourne then I guess it can be said that his hesitation and being a \"stiff\" led to the downfall.  Giovanelli confirms that Daisy is not interested in him (Giovanelli).  Winterbourne's wavering to the will of civilisation did him in as far as getting his prize - Daisy.  So Winterbourne and civilisation killed her because Winterbourne lost Daisy's confidence because HE was concerned about social conventions too much and if Daisy hadn't distanced herself from him because of this HE may have reasoned with Daisy to not go out late at night and avoid getting malaria...  pretty far fetched but I am trying to help the book make sense - Winterbourne himself is the vehicle of civilisation that undoes Daisy - after all he moves to Geneva (the Mecca of \"Stiffs\") and after all names are important to Henry James and Winterbourne did bear winter - as in the season most closely associated with death.Giovanelli, at the end, confirms that he was never a serious candidate for Daisy's affections. He also is never rude to Winterbourne, in fact Winterbourne finds him entertaining as well - despite all his prejudical thoughts towards Giovanelli. Giovanelli is just hanging out with her - Que Sera Sera - he does nothing by subterfuge to do anything to Winterbourne or to thwart his efforts for Daisy other than just exist. Winterbourne is a \"Stiff\" to the freedom loving world of Daisy.  Winterbourne is the undoing \"civilising\" force.Was the malaria a cheat as far as providing a proper ending? Okay, maybe not.  The dialog, however, especially at the start, was not believable nor entertaining or interesting. James seems to have found some footing with making the dialog interesting just before he provided his what to many might be a disappointing ending.  Okay, maybe the ending does make sense - but I am still going to give it four stars for the cheesy dialog at the beginning. Okay, what of the chessy dialog.  In it we find a calculating heart and mind, a conniver. Contrast that to how Werther operates at the start of \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\". Maybe WE, today, have so much trouble relating to this book because WE are a bunch of \"stiffs\" who can't even see what is wrong with Winterbourne.  Okay - I changed it to 5 stars.Is James contrasting/juxtaposing \"Daisy Miller\" to Goethe's \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\"?\"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains.\" Rousseau.Rousseau in a nutshell and in his own words:https://www.amazon.com/Creed-Priest-Savoy-Second-Enlarged/dp/B004V72TLG/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1509809336&sr;=1-1-fkmr0&keywords;=The+confession+of+a+priest+from+savoy"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "You can't be too judgemental when reading classics.
