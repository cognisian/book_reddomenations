It is both a love story and a history of Peru's troubles and cultures.  A great deal of material, well told, in a fairly small volume.  I read it before taking a holiday there, so I had a better understanding of what the nation has gone through.  If you don't like happy endings, skip the appendix and the novel still works very well.  But most readers will appreciate the lift of the extra chapter."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Death in the AndesIt\u2019s easy to see why Llosa is Peru\u2019s most famous novelist, and why he earned the Nobel Prize, after finishing Death in the Andes.In the beginning, I didn\u2019t like it much. It seemed very dark and overly masculine. A policeman and his assistant are stationed at a remote post in the Andes, charged with rooting out the Shining Path terrorists. The assistant entertains his boss by telling the story of his unrequited and tragic love. Meanwhile, mysterious and sinister forces in the village coalesce and make the corporal almost crazed with curiosity.Here are some of the themes, masterfully interwoven into a gripping novel:\u2022 Practices and tenets of the Shining Path, a Maoist group that wreaked havoc in Peru from the 1980s to the 2000s. I hadn\u2019t known about their senseless brutality, or how they drove people from the highlands int cities, destroying infrastructure as they went.\u2022 How boring and oppressive life in a mining town could be.\u2022 Mixture of ancient spirituality with current life for highland villagers; belief in witchcraft, belief in \u201capus\u201d, or spirits of the mountains, who must be appeased, etc.\u2022 Tensions between Quechua- and Spanish-speaking people, and distrust between highland and lowand groups\u2022 Widespreadness of corruption (even before druglords became more powerful)\u2022 Harshness of high-altitude climate\u2022 Power of romantic love, despite all odds\u2022 Role of storytelling in maintaining hope and creating bonds between peopleAs a female reader, I was constantly aware of the lack of women characters with whom I could identify. Also, as a North American, I very much felt like an outsider looking into an alien culture. These aren\u2019t necessarily bad things, just something to note.It was fascinating to watch the author develop a relationshp between the policeman and the local bartender (aptly named Dionisio) and his wife. The latter are at first repulsive, embodying paganism, wild abandon, alcohol abuse, sexuality, and everything the more \u201ccivilized\u201d policeman considers abhorrent. His obsession with solving three disappearances, however, leads him to become a more sensitive (and possibly even believing) listener. This plot line was one of the most important for an outsider like me wanting to peek inside Peruvian village life.Also, without giving anything away, be forewarned that the ending is a punch in the gut that you won\u2019t soon forget."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Three men disappear from a small mining village in the Peruvian Andes. The army sends two investigators, Corporal Lituma and his adjutant Tom\u00e1s, to get to the bottom of the apparent murders. Suspects include Sendero Luminoso (\u201cShining Path\u201d) guerilla-terrorists and a number of locals. For some of the locals, there\u2019s another possibility, the various demons and deities attributed to each of the mountains in the Andes.\u201cDeath in the Andes\u201d follows the time that the investigators spend in this remote village. There are two major story lines taking place at once. One narrative arc revolves around the investigation and day-to-day living in a tiny town under primitive living conditions. The second story line comes by night as the duputy, Tom\u00e1s, recounts his love affair with a girl that was out of his league in almost every way\u2014except, perhaps, with respect to virtuous living. The girl was in a relationship with an abusive gangster at the start, a condition that Tom\u00e1s found untenable. His love-driven reaction creates all manner of drama, and that drama serves as the only entertainment to be had in this remote village.The book is literary fiction, but it\u2019s not purely about the characters. As suggested, there\u2019s a strong narrative element. While the book is in a realist genre, i.e. nothing in it feels like it couldn\u2019t happen in our universe, the fact that the story takes place in an area of the Andes where the Shining Path is strong and mother nature is harsh means that there\u2019s plenty of tension and suspense.This is book is translated from Peruvian, and it seemed to me that the translator did a fine job of capturing the feel of the rural Andes. A few Spanish terms are used for terms like terrorists and avalanches to create a feel of a unique character of these concepts relative to this place. However, there are only a couple of these terms and so context is sufficient for the reader to readily keep them straight even if one is not gifted in picking up foreign terminology.In general, the book is quite readable.  The most challenging part of reading it is when Tom\u00e1s is telling his story because you have a three-way conversation going on over two time periods at once. (i.e. Tom\u00e1s voices himself and his girl as he tells their story, but then Cpl. Lituma chimes in periodically with questions\u2014or, more commonly, commentary.) However, the author uses dialogue tags throughout to avoid confusion. One just needs to be attentive in one\u2019s reading of these sections.I enjoyed this story. I picked up this book both because Llosa won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010 and I like to read something by winners, but also because I\u2019ve trekked in the Peruvian Andes and translated literature often offers one a unique form of insight into a place. This was no exception.I\u2019d recommend this book for readers of fiction. If one is looking to broaden one\u2019s horizons into literary fiction and /or translated fiction, this book is a good place to start. It offers humor and intrigue as well as deep characters and an infusion of geography and culture."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Two Peruvian police officers , both outsiders, are stationed in a remote post in the Andes.  While they investigate the disappearance of 3 men a terroristic organization operates in the area.  In the cold lonely nights, the younger officer (Tomasito) tells the older officer (Lituma) his love story which is how he came to be in such a remote location. They frequent a bar where the story of its owners weaves in and out.Like Llosa\u2019s Conversation in the Cathedral, the text is hard to follow.  The tenses move past to present and a conversation can be interrupted without warning to a backstory.  An episode can begin while another is in progress.  The only thing that is linear, and in some ways holds the book together, is Tomasito\u2019s love story.As the book begins, you expect it is about the serruchos, the Maoist style terrorists who could descend on this small town at any time.  The best prose relates to them: The story of the missing Pedrito Tinoco, his bonding with the vicunas and how the serruchos visited them;  the French couple and their presumptions about the terrorists; and the portrait of environmental researcher  who believes that the terrorists share her brand of idealism.This good prose is sandwiched in with anecdotes and backstories such that at md-point the book seems to be about life in the Peruvian Andes. Some backstories have what seems to be gratuitous crudity, both scatological and sexual.  The best back story is Tomasito\u2019s particularly when the dialog contrasts the old/wise and the young/impulsive.\"Feast of the Goat\" was masterful, and I remember (many years ago) \"Aunt Julia and the Script Writer\" as great.  The last two Llosa I've read (Conversation in the Cathedral and this one) have had prose that wandered too much to either enjoy or to make a point.  Were it not for the portions of exceptional prose I'd give it only one or two stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very interesting look into a culture very different from our own."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Death in the Andes: A Novel is a masterpiece of language, Peruvian history and sociology - both in it's original Spanish and adapted English translation.
