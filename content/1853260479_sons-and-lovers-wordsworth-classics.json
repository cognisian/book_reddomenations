That aside, the book's biggest problem is that Lawrence didn't seem to learn that he didn't have to tell the story on a practically day-by-day basis at the beginning of the book, if he was later going to tell it on a first weekly basis, then monthly, then just bordering yearly basis. I got the distinct impression that his publisher must have put him on a minimum word count basis, because so much of it seems to duplicate itself, as if Lawrence was counting the words until he'd met his targeted quota then abruptly ended it."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "It's a classic for a reason- great writing, story and characters that stand the test of time. I preferred the first three-quarters of the book, but was compelled enough to keep reading.

This edition of \"Sons and Lovers\" by D.H. Lawrence is a photographic reproduction of an early edition of the work. This does not mean that it is lacking in value per se.  But since the goal of the publisher was to reproduce the look and feel of the early edition (including imperfections and missing content) it is not suitable for a customer who simply wants to read the novel. This edition has missing pages, clipped margins where text is cut off, and heavy black marks obscuring text on the corners and edges on many of the pages.  In short much of the novel's content is simply missing or illegible.  Unless you are a literary historian or interested in the the publication history of \"Sons and Lovers\"  including the quality of published texts as a concept in general, this is not the book for you."}]}, "authors": ["D.

His mother, Gertrude, the educated daughter of Puritanical middle-class parents, has married the miner in the heat of physical attraction. The marriage soon disintegrates; Walter Morel takes to drink and beats his wife and children, and Mrs. Morel pours all her possessive love upon her sons, especially Paul.\r\n\r\nThe novel is concerned with Paul\u2019s painful introduction to the commercial world, his discovery of books and art, his growing discontent with his background of poverty and gloom, and his developing talent for painting. It records his lover affairs with Miriam and with Clara Dawes. Because of the strong bond of love between him and his mother, he is never able to give his affection wholly to either of the women.\r\n\r\n'Sons and Lovers,' which was attacked on its publication because of its frankness in dealing with sexual matters, is more naturalistic than Lawrence\u2019s later work. It is remarkable for its portrayal of English mining life, its vivid characterizations, and its poetic descriptions of nature.", "asin": "1853260479", "rank": "515284", "city": "London", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jU%2B3XL2hL.jpg", "country": "England", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
