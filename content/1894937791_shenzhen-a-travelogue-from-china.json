I like the idea of a graphic novel travelogue and I really wanted to like this\u2014but Chinese people are drawn as slant-eyed, wide-smiling caricatures. At one point, Guy literally expresses his bafflement about how \"Chinese people can't draw slanty eyes, even though they *have* slanty eyes\" (image attached). Shenzhen is depicted as some kind of nightmare and the locals are demure and submissive\u2014it didn't seem like he tried at all to experience or see anything beyond his myopic western perspective. There was little investigation or research into the rich inner lives and complex dynamics within Shenzhen, which was honestly a fascinating place in the 90s\u2014with its rapid industrialization abutting cultural traditions and recent political turmoil. The storytelling was bland and overwhelmingly one of a complacent, confused white man who has no interest in honest or authentic interaction with an 'exotic' place\u2014because we need more stories like this right?At some point, Guy compares himself to Tintin, which I guess is accurate if you're talking about neo-colonial attitudes and racial insensitivity. I can't believe this was published in 2006 and not 1896.To his credit, the art is good\u2014but the content is cheap."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Amusing time capsule graphic novel. It was from his experiences in the late 1990's - the equivalent would be doing a graphic novel of Silicon Valley/San Jose in 1962 when it mostly up and coming but still a small town in the sticks - amusing but seriously outdated if you intend to gleam any useful information (Shenzhen is the sort of the equivalent of Silicon valley but sort of like Silicon Valley in the early 1970's where you could drive down the street to find a manufacturer which you can really no longer do). So, an amusing illustrated tale that is more like a fictional graphic novel in 2017. Cute but seriously outdated."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The book is a quick read. I don't think every body would enjoy or understand reading about other cultures this way, but I was entertained. I, probably, will purchase another one of these light reads.

I have read 'Pyongyang' and really wanted to like this book. Instead, what I got was a snide, one-sided portrayal of Chinese life in an admittedly depressing, industrial city. The author doesn't speak a word of Chinese, and is obviously not interested enough to write anything apart from gobbledygook in the speech balloons of his Chinese-speaking characters. It is clear that the book is targeted at a Western audience who don't really want to learn anything about Chinese culture apart from how 'strange and alien' it all is, and how funny!! How did he expect to convey anything but a very crass and superficial impression of his time in China without even knowing how to communicate with his co-workers and anyone else he encounters? Is it really that funny to poke fun at how badly some Chinese speak English when you can't speak a word of their language? It is really too bad that Mr Delisle had such a boring time in Shenzhen but at least he got a book out of it....written primarily for expats like himself who wish to giggle about how weird and incomprehensible the locals are."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I hadn't read a comic since i was a kid and had never read a graphic novel before picking up Shenzhen while in a comic book store with my kids.  I noticed it because I had visited China and was interested in the subject.  This is the funniest and most spot-on description of China I've seen.  Nothing else conveys the weirdness and funny scenes you encounter there."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "If you've spent an extended period of time in China, or especially if you know the language, don't buy this book. You will be annoyed by the author's depictions of this \"mystical land of intrigue and oriental mystery\". Also, the parts where people speak Chinese use random characters instead of letting those in the know see what people are talking about.

With a dry wit and a clean line, Delisle makes the most of his time spent in Asia overseeing outsourced production for a French animation company. \r\n\r\nBy translating his fish-out-of-water experiences into accessible graphic novels,Delisle is quick to find the humor and point out the differences between Western and Eastern cultures.
