I enjoyed the author's vivid depictions of what life was like in Paris during that time period - lively, chaotic and free flowing as only French culture can be. In contrast, the American point of view was quite bland and the main character's moral compass is questionable and I didn't enjoy her character development. I picked up this book hoping for a light summer read, which was delivered by the Parisian side, but April, the main character of the book and her background story was sad to read and dragged on at times.

She hears escape.\r\n\r\nOnce in France, April quickly learns the apartment is not merely some rich hoarder&#039;s repository. Beneath the cobwebs and stale perfumed air is a goldmine, and not because of the actual gold (or painted ostrich eggs or mounted rhinoceros horns or bronze bathtub). First, there&#039;s a portrait by one of the masters of the Belle Epoque, Giovanni Boldini. And then there are letters and journals written by the very woman in the painting, Marthe de Florian. These documents reveal that she was more than a renowned courtesan with enviable decolletage. Suddenly April&#039;s quest is no longer about the bureaux plats and Louis-style armchairs that will fetch millions at auction. It&#039;s about discovering the story behind this charismatic woman.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s about discovering two women, actually.\r\n\r\nWith the help of a salty (and annoyingly sexy) Parisian solicitor and the courtesan&#039;s private diaries, April tries to uncover the many secrets buried in the apartment. As she digs into Marthe&#039;s life, April can&#039;t help but take a deeper look into her own. Having left behind in the States a cheating husband, a family crisis about to erupt, and a career she&#039;s been using as the crutch to simply get by, she feels compelled to sort out her own life too. When the things she left bubbling back home begin to boil over, and Parisian delicacies beyond flaky p\u00e2tisseries tempt her better judgment, April knows that both she and Marthe deserve happy finales.\r\n\r\nWhether accompanied by croissants or champagne, this delectable debut novel depicts the Paris of the Belle Epoque and the present day with vibrant and stunning allure. Based on historical events, Michelle Gable&#039;s A Paris Apartment will entertain and inspire, as readers embrace the struggles and successes of two very unforgettable women.", "asin": "1250067774", "rank": "31893", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Qf%2BHNZ5iL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
