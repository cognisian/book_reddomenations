A history lesson told by an engaging ensemble cast on all sides of the crisis, from the jaded CIA operatives to the killers and the politicians that turned Jamaica into a bloodbath in the seventies an eighties, to the drug dealers that brought crack to inner city America. I really didn't expect to like this book as much as I did. I break books down into those I should read and those I can't wait to read. After reading this I have to say it fills both catagories. The darkness That pervades the book is almost unremitting, but it's a darkness that sucks you in and spits you out at the end with a Wow. Well worth the read, I really couldn't put it down. It's undoubtedly the best book I have red all year, though there are a few scenes that I would like to erase from my memory, lol."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "AN EXCELLENT READ"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Fantastic."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Hard work.

A fictional, multi-voice account of the assassination attempt of Bob Marley in Jamaica in the 70\u2019s during a time of major political turmoil, the story is told by a couple dozen \u201ccharacters\u201d involved, in their own words -- an utterly engaging and realistic read, and probably the best multi-voiced novel I\u2019ve ever read. Frightening and horrific, the story is so real and so powerful and so vividly told. It\u2019s like Marlon James takes the reader back in time to Jamaica\u2019s underworld, introduces us to every character involved in this strange event, and lets him or her tell his or her part in the story directly to us. No explanations, footnotes, references or glossaries. Just an unforgettable story driven by extremely engaging voices of characters with whom you can\u2019t help but empathize \u2013 even though some of them are killers and gangsters and spies and drug dealers and ghosts and (yikes) reporters. It\u2019s a truly great book, in my opinion, and worth all of the hype and awards its received.It\u2019s a fantastic piece of storytelling. And I won\u2019t forget this book, this story or its characters (and their language) for a long, long time to come. I almost feel bad for Claudia Pineiro because I\u2019m reading her book, A Crack in the Wall, next and she has to compete with this. Although, the first two chapters are promising."}]}, "authors": ["Marlon James"], "isbn": "1594633940", "longitude": 0.0, "periods": ["1900s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "A Brief History of Seven Killings", "word_cloud": "twice look forward excellent wait become movie sweeping scope tell story violence jamaican politics death rise drug possession reveal spurt start eye disparate series character come go leave indelible mark lesson tell engage ensemble cast side crisis jade operatives killer politician turn bloodbath seventy eighties drug dealer bring crack inner city really expect much break read say fill categories darkness pervade almost unremitting darkness suck spit end really undoubtedly best red year scene erase memory lo fantastic work worth effort style amaze pick edge seat character tell story word give great past political situation quick beach worth reading definitely page probably exactly anyway fictional account assassination attempt time major political turmoil story tell couple dozen character involve word utterly engage realistic probably best ever frighten horrific story real powerful vividly tell take back time underworld introduces character involve strange event let tell part story directly explanation footnote reference glossary unforgettable story drive extremely engaging voice character help even killer gangster spy drug dealer ghost yikes reporter truly great opinion hype award fantastic piece storytelling forget story character language long long time come almost bad read next compete first chapter promise", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Historical Fiction"], "summary": "A \u201cthrilling, ambitious . . . intense\u201d (Los Angeles Times) novel that explores the attempted assassination of Bob Marley in the late 1970s. \r\n\r\nIn A Brief History of Seven Killings, Marlon James combines masterful storytelling with his unrivaled skill at characterization and his meticulous eye for detail to forge a novel of dazzling ambition and scope.\r\n\r\nOn December 3, 1976, just before the Jamaican general election and two days before Bob Marley was to play the Smile Jamaica Concert to ease political tensions in Kingston, seven unnamed gunmen stormed the singer\u2019s house, machine guns blazing. The attack wounded Marley, his wife, and his manager, and injured several others. Little was officially released about the gunmen, but rumors abounded regarding the assassins\u2019 fates.
