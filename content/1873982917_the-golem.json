Esoteric symbolism abounds, not always readily grasped. There are echoes of Gogol, Kafka, Dostoevsky, Shelley and others, but Meyrink's tale stands starkly and magnificently unique.Existential angst and profound psychological torment formed into an uncomfortably compelling read that can be interpreted on many levels.

I can no longer remember if it was DC, someone else in the intersim team, or whom exactly. I definitely greatly enjoyed the read and was very happy to find a copy in English since, if memory serves, it had originally been written in German.The book is part romance, part mystery, part thriller, and all spiritual. There are several plots all at once. One is the growth of the soul, one is the main character's involvement in protecting a Countess, one is the eventual union of the main character with another, far better, love interest. We then discover at the end that it could be said there were actually two main characters. Your understanding of the various levels of this book will vary depending on your grounding of knowledge of the Kabbalah (there are several alternate spellings, all of which are correct). You don't really need any as it gives you what you need as you read along, but it you are already familiar with the symbols you unlock so much more. This is one definitely worth rereading.I particularly liked how the spiritual quests intertwined with the challenges of the mundane world. Part of me would have liked more description of characters and surroundings, but the way the story is structured it is good that the surroundings can be forgotten about. This makes it easy for the reader to imagine this sort of adventure happening to them, which, on some level it happens to us all. I also very much liked how the book pointed out the three paths available, instead of fixating on just the main two."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Love"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The Golem\u2019 by Gustav Meyrink, is an early 20th-century literary gothic (published in 1915). However, instead of the horror or monster drama that we, gentle reader, may be expecting, he explores the meaning of identity, mystically speaking, in the form of a highbrow 19th-century book written in the style of a psychological gothic of the time.The word golem is a word used once in the Bible, specifically in Psalm 139:16, although we English speakers never see it because of translation issues. The KJV version of the Psalm: \u201cThine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; And in thy book all my members were written, Which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.\u201d The word golem actually meant originally \u201cmy unshaped form\u2019. The word is used sometimes today to describe someone who appears to be an obedient, but thick-witted, cretin.A fairy-tale golem monster is made traditionally by writing the word \u2018truth\u2019 somewhere, sometimes on a paper, which is placed into the mouth of a man-like statue made from clay or mud, or sometimes by writing the word on the statue\u2019s forehead. The statue becomes animated by this magical process, but it is an enslaved being, and it must obey the commands of whoever started its animation. The golem is deactivated by changing the inscription from \"Truth\" to \"Death\". The oldest versions of the story of making a golem have been traced back to Jewish fairy tales, primarily the story of Adam being created from mud by a god.The author Gustav Meyrink was fascinated by mysticism, so much so that his book, \u2018The Golem,\u2019 is loaded with references to his researches; but he seems to explore primarily in this novel the idea of identity in terms of mysticism.  Meyrink weaves into his plot a vague outline of the original golem story to illustrate his ideas with a great deal of playful (intellectually, not comic) literary inventiveness.Athanasius Pernath, our protagonist, lives a life of much mental confusion. He cannot remember very much of his past, and his present often appears to recede from reality into a waking dream. We learn from the events on the first page that Pernath has just finished reading about the life of Buddha, and shortly after he wakes up he immediately begins to experience a vision of a rock which is more like a lump of fat - a shapeless, formless stone of fat, like unformed mud.Pernath is a gem cutter, by trade, but we never see him at work. Instead, he frequents a neighborhood (a Jewish enclave) of housing, restaurants, pubs and shops where he meets his friends and acquaintances (by the way, every character is bleak, mysterious and peculiar, except for one - and it isn\u2019t Pernath). He picks up local gossip and doings, some of which interests him a great deal.A junk dealer, Aaron Wassertrum, is one who particularly interests him because he appears to be a force of negativity or evil, and his daughter (maybe), Rosina, is perhaps a teenage prostitute, a possible victim of Wassertrum\u2019s depravity, whatever it may have been. She certainly is an uninhibited force of unconstrained sexuality in Pernath\u2019s mind.Pernath is attracted to another woman, Miriam, who is moral and responsible, who he met while visiting her father, Shemaiah Hillel. Pernath himself had a nervous breakdown after a previous unhappy love affair, and he is being treated by Shemaiah Hillel with hypnotism to be calm and to forget. Remembering his past (he gets flashbacks) causes Pernath extreme anxiety. He also sees ghostly visions and haunted houses. It may or may not be true he is being haunted by a golem. Pernath is the most undependable narrator I have come across in my reading to date! A lot takes place in Meyrink\u2019s story; but since we see everything through Pernath\u2019s eyes, it is impossible to know how much of what happens is from his real life and what is occurring in a waking dream state. Frankly, most of the book appears to be a dream vision."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This is NOT a horror story and nothing like the silent film version of the animated man of clay. Rather, this is a superbly written \"dream within a dream\", with Kafkaesque overtones.The reading is easy and the story moves forward quickly. Pretty good for a book written in 1915 and translated from German to English in 1995. And there is a mind boggling ending that Rod Sterling would have envied.When you read this book be prepared for a trip into \"The Twilight Zone\"."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I bought this book because I wanted to read his \"Green Face\" book and the reviews said this one was better. I'm about half way into it now and not disappointed. In many ways Mr. Meyrink is a poet. It's fun to read him just to enjoy his words. Mike Mitchell did a fine job translating."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This is a very interesting book. I fear my review is not going to be overly insightful. There is a lot that remains opaque about the novel for me, but, I will say, that is part of the reason I enjoyed it so much. There is a lot of occult symbolism in the novel and it is always bad when symbolism becomes too transparent. Meyrink avoids becoming too transparent with his symbolism which is what lends the novel its mystical aura and the feeling of limitless depth. There is always the feeling that there is a hidden meaning lying just beyond the grasp of the conscious mind. The novel is mostly the story of an old gem engraver named Athanasius Pernath, but, his story intertwines with a number of interesting stories. There is the revenge story of Charousek and Wassertrum, the tale of adultery between Angelina and Dr. Savioli, and the poverty stricken, but deeply religious, Hillel and Miriam. Athanasius Pernath experiences many hallucinatory visions throughout the novel, some of them involving the figure of the Golem which gives the novel its title. The novel really succeeds in creating the atmosphere of early twentieth-century Prague and the Jewish ghettos.There are a lot of interesting ideas in the book. I believe the book works out what I would call a religion of the Self. I am using the term \"the Self\" in the sense that Ralph Waldo Emerson and the psychologist Carl Jung used it. There is a character who expresses this creed late in the book when he says \"For me, the most sacred thing imaginable is to allow my steps to be guided by the spirit within me, blindly, wholly trusting in it wherever the path may lead, to poverty or riches, to the gallows or to a throne\" (236). Following the inner spirit in this sense can be difficult. As another character mentions in a letter \"We humans are an impure race, often it takes weeks of fasting and waking until we can understand the whisperings of the soul\" (222). This is not, therefore, mere hedonism. It is not a matter of following our every superficial whim, but, of following the deepest urges within us. This is, according to Pernath himself, \"the most religious devotion to duty in the most profound, most arcane sense of the word\" (224).Another theme of the novel is that the ordinary, sensory world is merely a veil for a hidden, spiritual world, with its own laws. This world resides within the depths of the soul and there is a hidden knowledge contained in the soul. After leafing through a book and having visions Pernath feels \"as if I had been searching through my brain...Everything the voice had said to me I had carried within myself all my life, only it had been obscured and forgotten\" (37). We can see a kind of Platonic epistemology working here (knowledge is recollection) in opposition to the dominant empiricist epistemologies of our times. For Meyrink the senses are just another kind of dreaming. He writes \"When men arise from their beds, they think they have shaken off sleep and they know not that they have fallen victim to their senses and are in the grip of a much deeper sleep than the one they have just left\" (82-83). Clearly, we cannot expect any spiritual knowledge to come through the senses.Meyrink has one of his characters give a beautiful analogy which, I think, expresses the limitations of the senses, and the hidden efficacy of the spiritual world. The character describes the way that inanimate objects are blown about by the wind. He says that scraps of paper whirl around \"chasing one another as if each had sworn to kill the others\" (54). Because the wind is invisible we have a tendency to ascribe emotions, will, volition, etc. to the inanimate objects. We do not really see what moves them. We are in the same position in relation to our fellow human beings and ourselves. Meyrink has written an interesting and compelling story which, I think, expresses the mystery that we are to ourselves quite well. We do not know who we are, what motivates us, or where we are going. We follow our own deep, inner urges, not sure whether they are dragging us towards paradise or perdition. We know we are clay, and feel chained to this world, but also feel, at times, as if we belonged to another world, but, we are not sure whether our vision of the \"other world\" is a reality, or merely a dream in a fog. This novel, to me, manages to capture all of that, and entertain the reader at the same time. I would definitely recommend it."}]}, "authors": ["Gustav Meyrink"], "isbn": "1873982917", "longitude": 14.4212535, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "The Golem", "word_cloud": "start well become boring
