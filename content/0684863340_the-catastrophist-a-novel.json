It details the rise and fall of Patrice Lumumba, portrayed as a genuine liberationist, whose doom was perhaps inevitable in such a divided country. Many of the problems that beset Africa are recognised. The machinations of the Americans, represented by Mark Stipe, a CIA operative, segue into the other story in the novel. This is the fading love affair between the narrator, James, a middle-aged English novelist with a tendency to distance himself from ideals and political passions, and Ines, a journalist for L'Unita who embraces Lumumba's cause wholeheartedly. The author explores well the issues of love and personal feelings in a time that demands political commitment. The title is Ines' description of James as someone who always expects the worst. The book contrasts interestingly with Barbara Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible, set in the same time and place, about an American missionary family.The Poisonwood Bible"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I didn't expect to like this book as much as I did!

James views his life as a story of failure.It is 1959 in Leopoldville, Belgium Congo, west Africa. It is the time of the rising independence of the Congolese from the Belgiums; a time of violence and dissent. James finds the politics uninteresting; he is only there to save his relationship with Ines. He comes to realize that Ines is more passionate about her work and the freedom of the people of Congo than about him. They have been together for two years in London, where everything was perfect. It was far from perfect in Leopoldville for James.James wants commitment, longevity and marriage. Ines wants none of this and leaves James for Auguste, a younger Congolese man. James defies death to rescue Ines and her new lover from the bloody conflict of angry dissidents, but does it rekindle their love?Historically factual, it is a compelling, interesting, and emotional read as James lays bare his feelings of love and hate.Martina Nicolls, Author of \"The Sudan Curse\" and \"Kashmir on a Knife-Edge\""}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "On June 30, 1960, the Congo was emancipated from Belgium. African nationalist leader Patrice Emery Lumumba became the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo when it declared its independence - the long awaited \"Depanda\" had arrived! In October 1958 Lumumba had founded the Congolese National Movement (Mouvement National Congolais; MNC), the first nationwide Congolese political party. Forced out of office during a period of violent political upheaval in September 1960, he was assassinated in January 1961.During the Congo's turbulent beginning many countries intervened in its political affairs. \"They used: fear of communism, economic collapse, civil war, and protection of European citizens living in the Congo to back themselves for intervening.\" And the expatriate community, living in luxury, sipping sundowners at poolside, did not appreciate their world, their comfortable lives slipping out of their control.At the time, the Congo was the biggest and richest country in central Africa, one with huge strategic importance - not only to the Belgians, but to the US. Katanga Province, the size of Britain, remains one of the richest areas in all Africa if not the richest. \"The mines of the Union Miniere and Forminiere provided the world with eight per cent of its copper, sixty per cent of its uranium, seventy-three per cent of its cobalt, eighty per cent of its industrial diamonds. Katanga has gold, silver, tin, zinc, manganese, columbium, cadmium, tungsten, tantalum: its supplies will never be exhausted.\" This was the land of Unilever, Brufina, Union Miniere and the Banque Empain, companies which were not about to let their holdings slip away easily.Into this tumultuous, politically charged setting wanders James Gillespie, a disaffected Irish/English writer, author of a few well received novels and a contributor to various periodicals. He arrives in Leopoldsville with the intent of pursuing a waning relationship with Ines Sabiani, his fiery, radical Italian girlfriend with whom he is deeply in love. Gillespie's arrival in the Congo represents a major emotional commitment for him. Ines is a journalist with her country's communist newspaper L'Unita. She is as passionate about the cause of Independence and about the charismatic leader, Lumumba, as James is indifferent, or as he would say, \"objective.\" And he is a skeptic, a pessimist. Part of the problem between the two lovers is that James is never on anyone's side. He insists, \"I see all sides. My craft demands it.\" He is against intolerance, dogma, illiberalism. But he is for nothing. In?s invests herself emotionally as well as professionally in that which she believes. Her affair with James is doomed before Gillespie sets foot on African soil - just as Patrice Lumumba's government is doomed before he takes office. At one point In?s tells Gillespie that, \"Dante wrote that the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in times of great moral crises maintain their neutrality.\" She accuses him of being a \"catastrofista,\" a \"catastrophist,\" one who believes \"that no problem is small. Nothing can be fixed; it is always the end.\"As James becomes caught up in the historical movement, colonial injustice and the chaotic brutality that accompanies it, he is finally forced to take sides...and action.Although well written, I did have some difficulty with author Ronan Bennett's style. It made for ponderous reading at times. I am fascinated by this period in Africa, especially the politics, and by the character of Patrice Lumumba in particular, so I had personal incentive to persevere. \"The Catastrophist\" reminds me of Graham Greene's \"The Quiet American.\" Both novels deal with the chaotic end of colonialism, have journalists as protagonists and idealistic, if Machiavellian, CIA operatives fomenting intrigue and even more violence. The colonialists in both novels, the Belgians here, the French in Vietnam in Greene's work, act paternalistically and condescendingly towards the \"natives\" and don't really take the independence movements seriously.\"The Catastrophist was short-listed for the 1998 Whitbread Novel Award.JANA"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "although i liked the setting - and the plot & characters were good, they writing style made it difficult for me to get through this book.  it seemed to general where more detail was needed, too much detail where i wasn't interested and in general i put the book down after every few pages, chapters - where is this going, why is he telling me this...it was just difficult to get through.  on the whole the story is good, but it wasn't fun to read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I read this book over two years ago, and I still think of it often.

While expatriates loll about their pools in a colonial paradise soon to erupt into chaos, huge crowds are drawn to the charismatic Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba -- and his even more dangerous rivals.\r\n\r\nOne man sees the cracks appearing around him and struggles to hold on to his lover, his sanity, and ultimately, his life. Gillespie, the outsider, a journalist, is in L\u00e9opoldville for the beautiful Italian, In\u00e9s. He is desperate for her love, while she is obsessed with the unfolding drama, caught up in history, ideology, hero worship.\r\n\r\nIn a world slipping out of control, gripped by disgust, fear, and incomprehension, Gillespie feels that events threaten to overwhelm him -- as does his friendship with the amiable but sinister American, Stipe; his relationship with his canny native driver, Auguste; and, above all, his love for In\u00e8s.\r\n\r\nIt is In\u00e8s who defines Gillespie as a catastrofista, an Italian word for somebody for whom \"no problem is small. Nothing can be fixed; it is always the end,\" for Gillespie is deeply pessimistic and skeptical about their relationship as well as politics, while In\u00e8s believes in engagement and commitment, whatever the risks -- which, as it turns out, are greater than either of them can foresee.\r\n\r\nAs colonial corruption and injustice give way to turmoil, brutality, and murder, Gillespie is finally forced to confront what is happening before his eyes. In subtle, haunting prose, Ronan Bennett captures the complex connection between the personal and the political, between cruelty and lust, between eroticism and love, between courage and fear, between detachment and involvement.\r\n\r\nThe Catastrophist is a bold, courageous novel, at once a searing love story and a terrifying political thriller, in the tradition of such books as Graham Greene's The Comedians or such postcolonial classics as The Year of Living Dangerously -- an erotic Heart of Darkness for the twentieth century.", "asin": "B005AZ4HQS", "rank": 0, "city": "Kinshasa", "image": "", "country": "DR Congo", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
