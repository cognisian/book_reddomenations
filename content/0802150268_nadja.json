I read the book together with a friend (also reading the English translation), who experienced the same. I am considering the option the translation is not very good, simply base don the fact that the book is a classic. The second part is interesting. The photographs are very low resolution due to the time they were taken, but still fascinating."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I've never actually read Breton before, and I have a hard time knowing what to make of this. I tend to think of people who spearhead artistic movements and write 'manifestos' as urbane, jaded and sophisticated to the point of seeming almost inhuman.Breton's prose certainly winds itself through some dazzling conceptual mazes, but I think I was caught off guard by how mopey the book, about an infatuation Breton has with an unstable young woman, was on a basic level. I still enjoyed it, but I feel like I would really need to be submerged in Parisian intellectual life in the 1920's to fully appreciate it."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Still waitign to read."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Bought French version by mistake.

The first-person narrative is supplemented by forty-four photographs which form an integral part of the work -- pictures of various \"surreal\" people, places, and objects which the author visits or is haunted by in Nadja's presence and which inspire him to mediate on their reality or lack of it. \r\n\r\n\"The Nadja of the book is a girl, but, like Bertrand Russell's definition of electricity as \"not so much a thing as a way things happen,\" Nadja is not so much a person as the way she makes people behave. She has been described as a state of mind, a feeling about reality, a kind of vision, and the reader sometimes wonders whether she exists at all. Yet it is Nadja who gives form and structure to the novel.", "asin": "0802150268", "rank": "138788", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41K0AFXM63L.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
