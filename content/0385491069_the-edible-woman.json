Completely underrated work of hers... probably because The Handmaid's Tale gets so much publicity with the new series out.  The Edible Woman tracks quite an interesting history of psychological falling-apart based around the heroine's diet.  As Marian can consume fewer and fewer items that make up an essential diet, she is forced to conclude that perhaps the issue is not herself, but an extraneous force.  Definitely worth the read, I could not put it down."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "New to me. Old to the world. Still a charming and relevant story by a skilled writer"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "My wife stumbled over the word \"soggy\" on the first page of Edible Woman and could only bring herself to limp forward a couple more before collapsing.  I tripped over the word \"stolid\" in the book's very first sentence.  A nasty stub, I must admit.  Any narrative in the first person should best be cleansed of the word stolid until a full chapter in, in my opinion.  Just too freakin' snooty right off the bat.  Even the first sentence of James' Portrait of a Lady was less snooty by comparison.  Of course it didn't have stolid in it.  First couple of chapters in, the characters were dull and uninteresting to me.  I could barely sacrifice the energy to turn the page; though I suspect the characters themselves (if they were real) wouldn't have blamed me.  What kept me going at first was the dated feel to the story.  Though published in '69, it was written by Atwood in '65.  The main character, Marian, informs the reader early on \"I'm certain I'm being groomed for something higher up, but as I have only hazy notions of the organizational structure of Seymour Surveys(the character's employer) I can't imagine what.\"  Yikes.  Sounds kinda flighty, even for the 60s.  Dull, but flighty.  This book starts slow, as I've said.  My initial question after the first two chapters was how the hell did it get published in the first place?  Publishers are notorious for reading a couple of pages and tossing a manuscript under the desk if it only partially grabs a reader in its beginning.  Did I mention it has freakin' stolid in the first sentence?  Oh.  Anyway, turns out the publisher allegedly \"lost\" the manuscript for about four years.  Sure, that's the ticket.  How did it manage to get found, read, and released, you ask?  I'd be speculating of course, but I envision someone took it accidentally into the office restroom after an over-adventurous lunch at a nearby foreign restaurant.  You choose it's ethnicity according to personal prejudice and plausible dysenteric qualities.  Well, the good news is that the abject dullness of the first couple of chapters appears to have a point.  The point is to give the main character and narrator of the first part the appearance of being normal.  If you've read anything of Atwood's fiction however(before this, I hadn't), you've already likely guessed, she isn't.  Spoilers, sort of:  Marian works at her job.  Marian has a hunky, lawyer boyfriend.  Marian meets an odd drifty piece of crap graduate student while soliciting interviews for her job.  Marian suddenly freaks out and bolts from an evening out with hunk and friends.  Hunk and friends manage to capture her.  Hunk(being a lawyer, but not too smart) decides to ask her to marry him the very day after.  She says sure.  WTF?  The rest of the book deals with the slow worsening of the nonsense begun in the first part.  The second part is narrated in the third person.  Marian's voice has been cancelled.  She shuts herself off from eating food, gradually, progressively, and semi-rationally.  Food plays an important part in this novel, as the title would seem to insist.  A bigger theme, I feel, is the prevalence of human need for sufficient autonomy, if not at times outright militant autocracy.  Marian's excuses as to why she won't eat certain foods sound veganish at first.  Poor animals...  Right to live for all...  Every life is precious, even a lettuce leaf...  Marian's refusal to eat seems much less about a refusal to kill, to consume, to exploit; more does it feel a method of systematically segregating oneself off from any and all outside invading influences, even if only they be edible nourishment.  Also, Marian's decision to leave all decisions to her fianc\u00e9 symbolized separation for me, not submission.  When assaulted on all sides, best to circle all wagons until the danger passes.  I feel this is less a feminist novel; more a mental health survival story.  This is an interesting book, though one with way too many references to chesterfields.  Atwood does a fantastic job of painting mental illness in subtle tones.  The slight shifts in characters' moods throughout unsettle the reader. The story keeps you guessing about itself.  The end is original and intriguing.  Atwood's first is indeed an impressive first.  And my toe has almost completely healed by now.  Did I mention the word stolid is in the first sentence?"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This is Atwood's first published novel in 1969, and for a debut novel, it is surprisingly polished, bearing in mind her young age then. The main character is Marian, a university grad who is rooming with another young woman, Ainsley, in a house with a religious, sanctimonious landlady, who seems every ready to be outraged and confrontational with her two tenants.Reflective of the time of the novel, and even now, it captures the struggles of young women like Marian who were navigating a minefield of gender roles and relations, and forging their independence and identities in changing times. Faced with more 'conventional' friends like the oft-pregnant Clara, who had taken the more tried and tested route available with an early marriage and a trove of kids, and set against the more worldly Ainsley who professes to never wanting to be tied down by any kind of conjugal binds, Marian finds herself at the crossroads when her new relationship with Peter, a young, dashing and upcoming lawyer in training, reaches a new plateau and she contemplates marriage and the dreaded \"settling down\". Then a complication arises which threatens to overwhelm her as she grapples with what she really wants and the direction her life should take.Split into two parts and a coda of sorts, it is interesting that the first part is written in Marian's first-person voice, while the second part sees Marian's increasingly inexplicable actions in the third person, before resolving into a first person coda, as if Marian regains her voice after grappling with a journey of self-discovery/actualisation she cannot quite comprehend or articulate herself in the second part.While assured in substance and writing, I couldn't help noticing the many obvious tropes and thematic references used to address the fulfilment of femininity and the games men and women play, with the one most commonly seen in this novel about the contrary nurturing and destructive impulses that define the relationships between the sexes. Duncan, a significant (and awfully detestable and self-involved) character in the sequence of events, tells Marian rather smugly, \"I can tell you're admiring my febrility. I know it's appealing, I practise at it; every woman loves an invalid. I bring out the Florence Nightingale in them. Be careful.\"The characters constantly jolt me with either their sudden explosiveness on the one hand or frustrate me with their inert and yet manipulative intent on the other, but never quite gain my full empathy. However, I see this as indicative of the overall unsettling subject matter which cannot be resolved."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Felt was a waste of money, only read because it was a book club choice."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "For me, the book was a little boring and stupid at some points.
