In his specificity, the author brings poetry to things that society glosses over (buffs, to use his word). The uniqueness of hip hop beats. The colors and brands and attributes of paint. The nuance of a dribble that changes the trajectory of the shooter, the defender, the ball. The cultural traditions of individual Pacific islands. The way \"Macedonian\" does not mean \"generic Eastern European\" -- but *Macedonian*. And it's not just the reader perceiving this poetry; the characters contain it, and consider it. It's all about heritage -- of music, people, art, places -- and what that heritage means to today.

It\u2019s written in a combination of poetry and prose, and examines the alienation, disempowerment and dislocation of three young men on the fringes of Australian urban society.  The three young men, Solomon Amosa, a Samoan, his \u2018beige\u2019 coloured half-brother Jimmy and Solomon\u2019s best friend Aleks Janeski, a Macedonian, attend a local greyhound race meeting.  The men talk about dog racing (it will be the last race for a dog called Mercury Fire), about women, about hip-hop.  Solomon, who went to a private school on a basketball scholarship is both the most personable and the most self-aware.  Jimmy, who doesn\u2019t know who his father is, doesn\u2019t know where he belongs.  Aleks, married with a small daughter, is trying to improve their situation.  He does a bit of graffiti (\u2018graff\u2019), but ends up in prison in association with drug trafficking.\u2018This has always been a land of fire.\u2019So, what makes this story work?  Does the poetry fracture the prose, or unify it? What forms will their individual struggles for identity take?  And how does hip-hop work as a unifying force?  There\u2019s constant movement in this novel, the rhythm of the poetry, the beat of the music underscore the activity, and the environment itself is not passive.  There\u2019s sense of foreboding, of possibility and of danger.\u2018The day hot and strange and flattened, almost monochrome.\u2019Although in many ways Solomon was the most likeable and articulate of the characters, it was Aleks I felt most sympathy for.  I could sense his loss: trying to provide for a family, lost between the Macedonian culture of his youth and the Australian culture of his adoption.  Jimmy has even less of a clear identity, and sense of belonging, and this is going to erupt somewhere.  Somehow.At times I found the blend of poetry and prose dislocating: different languages, differing ways of communicating.  But it worked well as a vehicle of telling the men\u2019s stories and for grounding the hip-hop culture which unites them.  This, for me, is a different way of exploring alienation and dispossession.  One in which I am an outsider and have to work hard to understand.  One in which I hope for positive new beginnings.  This book is well worth reading.Omar Musa is a Malaysian-Australian rapper and writer.  He has released three albums, published two poetry books, and this is his first published novel.\u2018No worries.  I\u2019ll be back.\u2019Jennifer Cameron-Smith"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "An interesting anthropological tour of a sub culture that would be unfamiliar to anyone over the age of 30 (which I am).  The writing is lovely, almost poetic at times.  Musa creates such real characters that lie on the periphery of our vision.  These three young men are trying to make something of themselves but keep bumping into their sociodemographic boundaries which ultimately keep them from becoming something else.Their love of hip-hop culture and graffiti art is presented to the reader and we learn much about its relevance to them.  They are creative men who love these art forms which the establishment does not value.I highly recommend this book as truly fresh voice."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A part of Australia that usually gets thrown over in literature for sheep and paddocks.
