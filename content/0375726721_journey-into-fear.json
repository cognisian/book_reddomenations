Penguin Publishing (who else) seemed to have bought the rights to republish it as recently as 2009. Eric Ambler should be remembered as the \u2018grand father of the thriller\u2019 and must have \u2018wooowed\u2019 audiences much like Graham Greene did not long later. Greene turned many of his writings directly into film (and even had some of his scripts published after the movie: \u2018The Third Man\u2019 instantly comes to mind. Ambler, on the other hand, also had films made from his works, but these were secondary to his literary efforts).In this edition, we the reader, find that the main character in the story, Graham, has found himself in the midst of some pretty violent people. Indeed, they have been hired to kill him and seem to have him cornered. He doesn\u2019t know where to turn or who to trust because even the people around him aren\u2019t all what they seem. There\u2019s a Greek trader, a female dancer, a German doctor and a very bad man in an old crumpled jacket all on the same ship together. It read a little an Agatha Christie story, but it wasn\u2019t a who-dun-nit. There was a hint of Alistair McClean in the action and, dare I say it, a little of John le Carre in the espionage. But, Ambler was at the forefront of thriller writing with most of his work written way back during WW Two. Well, before these great writers.It made for an exciting read. (SPOILER ALERT) This reader thought that, however, that the villains in the story were too clever and articulate to be believable and that they would have been simply waiting for him on shore at the end of his voyage and collected him after he had cleared customs, rather than colluded with him and given articulated arguments whilst on board the ship. This reader would like to give it three and half stars for it, but with the simplified system used by Amazon, this reader has decided upon a tough but sound choice of three stars. Give him a read if you stumble upon him or on Kindle or even at a second hand bookshop (if you still go to those)."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "20 or more words required post in Amazon as Tim Davis & goodreads.

The Anglo-Turkish Treaty meant a trip for him, and he enjoyed travel. The deal was closed, and Graham will leave the next morning. The company's representative takes him to a local nightclub. Someone watches him, then leaves. When he returns to his room, shots are fired at him. It was an attempt at murder, to sabotage the armaments deal. For reasons of personal security, Graham will return by ship. Colonel Haki shows Graham photographs of suspects, and Graham recognizes the man who was watching him.The ship docks at Athens. Mr Kuvetli asks Graham to show him around Athens. When they return, Graham finds a new passenger, one that he has seen before. Graham had been given a revolver for his protection, but he left it in his suitcase. When he decided to carry it, he found that it was gone. The enemy agents know he is defenseless, and can succeed either by stopping or delaying him. The German agent makes him an offer he can't refuse: die now, or take a 6-week vacation! But the latter choice means he would disappear without a trace, solely dependent on the mercy of his enemies. Firing a bullet into a gasoline tank acts as a deus ex machina. Of course, the good guy wins in the end. The individuals encountered in this book all have their little secrets.Ambler's novels feature an individual struggling against the powers of a state, and surviving.
