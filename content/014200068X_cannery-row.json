This is one of the funniest and most heart-warming books I have ever read. The cast of characters is composed of the unseemly individuals most of us never spend a moment\u2019s time with in our entire lives \u2013 outside of possibly spooning them some soup while volunteering at a local shelter. These are the cast offs, outcasts, prostitutes, derelicts, bums, crooks, hustlers, immigrants and the lost. All of those souls who never show up on our TV programs or at our local churches \u2013 yet they are out there, they live among us \u2013 hidden by our ignorance, dismissal and, possibly, guilt.This is not a story about the suffering of the down and out. It is not about oppression, poverty, or the plight of the poor. It is a story the takes us through the everyday life of those who live on the other side of the tracks. It is ultimately a story about community and life \u2013 about appreciating what you have, enjoying those you are with and supporting one another in whatever way you are able.This is a needed tale in the land of more.We live in a culture that is paralyzed by \u201cthe missing tile\u201d syndrome. Dennis Prager discusses this plight in the video below. In essence \u2013 we tend to fixate all of our energy and thoughts on the things, traits or features that we do not have. We could be in great health, have a wonderful marriage, a fulfilling career, healthy children, and a home of our own \u2013 all blessings in the real world \u2013 but we will often think only of the vacation we weren\u2019t able to take, the new car we can\u2019t afford, the six-pack abs we don\u2019t have and on and on and on. We spend our days lamenting what we don\u2019t have, what our neighbor does have \u2013 meanwhile, our neighbor looks at us with the same feelings. Happiness will forever elude those who cannot be grateful for what they have, enjoy it completely and share it willingly.It is called contentment \u2013 which is the enemy of a consumer economy. Sometimes, we all need a reminder of what we have, how much worse off we could be \u2013 to just stop looking at those who are \u201cabove\u201d you, but instead look at the billions who are \u201cbehind\u201d you.Reading about Mac and the boys makes me remember that every one of those people who are on the \u201coutside\u201d are individuals \u2013 they have a history, a family, life experiences and a story to tell \u2013 of where they are from and how they arrived where they are today. Check out the song \u201cMoments\u201d by Emerson Drive \u2013 the lyrics are amazing and it hits you in the heart\u2013 we have all been loved, but how do so many get lost?I could read Steinbeck all day long, he is an amazing writer who brings you into the hearts and minds of his characters \u2013 they become your friends and you will carry them with you for the rest of your life.

Henry the painter sorts through junk lots for pieces of wood to incorporate into the boat he is building, while the girls from Dora Flood\u2019s bordello venture out now and then to enjoy a bit of sunshine. Lee Chong stocks his grocery with almost anything a man could want, and Doc, a young marine biologist who ministers to sick puppies and unhappy souls, unexpectedly finds true love. Cannery Row is just a few blocks long, but the story it harbors is suffused with warmth, understanding, and a great fund of human values.\r\n\r\nFirst published in 1945, Cannery Row focuses on the acceptance of life as it is\u2014both the exuberance of community and the loneliness of the individual. John Steinbeck draws on his memories of the real inhabitants of Monterey, California, and interweaves their stories in this world where only the fittest survive\u2014creating what is at once one of his most humorous and poignant works. In Cannery Row, John Steinbeck returns to the setting of Tortilla Flat to create another evocative portrait of life as it is lived by those who unabashedly put the highest value on the intangibles\u2014human warmth, camaraderie, and love.", "asin": "014200068X", "rank": "21135", "city": "Monterey", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51pKtoV%2Bd2L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
