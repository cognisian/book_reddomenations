I appreciated it because it educated me on the plight of the American Indian. Since I was a child, I thought about them every Thanksgiving.

Reading his book has made me more appreciative of my writings ( Notes) and Video on Facebook, and my Video on Youtube.com entitled the Movement For Fairness...It is denied to anybody and everybody regardless of who they are to change the past. All anybody can do is work from that point on. I think we should Unite regardless of Religion, Religion Beliefs, Race, Creed, Color or Ethnic Background to help make Justice a Reality for all.

A serial murderer called the Indian Killer is terrorizing Seattle, hunting, scalping, and slaughtering white men. Motivated by rage and seeking retribution for his people\u2019s violent history, his grizzly MO and skillful elusiveness both paralyze the city with fear and prompt an uprising of racial brutality. Out of the chaos emerges John Smith. Born to Indians but raised by white parents, Smith yearns for his lost heritage. As his embitterment with his dual life increases, Smith falls deeper into vengeful madness and quickly surfaces as the prime suspect. Tensions mount, and while Smith battles to allay the anger that engulfs him, the Indian Killer claims another life. \r\n\r\nWith acerbic wit and chilling page-turning intensity, Alexie takes an unflinching look at what nurtures rage within a race both colonized and marginalized by a society that neither values nor understands it.", "asin": "0802143571", "rank": "211972", "city": "Seattle", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Bq-aXE0hL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
