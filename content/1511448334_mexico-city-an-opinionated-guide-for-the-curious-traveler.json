This one was discovered by chance on my last trip, but it is now probably my favorite.  The author is an artist and he brings an artistic sensibility to his choice of sights, activities, and restaurants that is very close to my own.  In addition to listings, the book contains 16 walking tours that include the standard sights and off-beat ones as well -- some of his discoveries could be made only by someone who loves Mexico City and is willing to explore its more unusual haunts."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Just returned from CDMX and had an amazing trip.  I used this book in planning the trip and as a reference while I was there.  For a travel book, I found this well organized and easy to read.  I only had four days there so I only used a couple of the walking tours.  I hired a local guide (who grew up and lived in CDMX) to take me to Teotihuacan and so many of the recommendations our guide made reconciled with this book.  I highly recommend.  Note:  The Fonart store near the Alameda has permanently closed."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "As someone else commented, this book is mostly walking tours.

I bought it because the sample made it clear that the guide was comprised of walking tours of various neighborhoods, that's exactly what we (at least my wife and I), want to do. This guide saved me hours digging through each neighborhood and finding the highlights. My two cents would be to use this as a starting point, if he's sending you to places or architecture you're not super interested in, you can pass by quickly or skip. He clearly knows and loves the city, we covered maybe 7 of his tours in our 5 days and found it an ideal way to explore and enjoy Mexico City (and yes, we also loved Mexico City)."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great for my travels. ."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "good guide"}]}, "authors": ["Jim Johnston"], "isbn": "1511448334", "longitude": -99.1333416, "periods": ["2000s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "Mexico CIty: An Opinionated Guide for the Curious Traveler", "word_cloud": "visit organized section city make easy plan day try several suggested restaurant disappoint help amaze experience probably guide make annual trip visit family discover chance last trip probably favorite author artist bring artistic sensibility choice sight activity restaurant close addition listing contain walking tour include standard sight one well discovery someone love willing explore unusual haunt just return amazing trip use plan trip reference travel find well organize easy day use couple walking tour hire local grow lived many recommendation make reconcile highly recommend note store permanently close someone else comment mostly walk tour weekend appreciate walk tour way see lot city relatively short time very helpful day trip go back use great city country love very superficial review different place specially museums basic really prefer guide give much useful detail information year old son travel use primary buy sample make clear comprise walking tour various neighborhood exactly least wife want save hour dig neighborhood find highlight cent start point send place architecture super interested pas quickly skip clearly know love city cover maybe tour day find ideal way enjoy also love travel good", "genres": ["History", "Travel Writing"], "summary": "Mexico City, as one of the largest metropoli on the planet, can overwhelm even the most adventurous visitor.
