Yet there are as many ghosts in the neighborhood as there are beneath the dome.\r\n\r\nLocal writer and guide Tim Krepp intrepidly takes on the best-known haunted tales while also exploring the lesser-known specters. From the weeping lady of The Maples to Commodore Tingey, who still stands watch in the Navy Yard, to the dozens of famous ghosts hosted by Congressional Cemetery, many former residents seem bound to their old home. Join Krepp as he explores the most historic and hair-raising haunts of the Hill.", "asin": "1609495861", "rank": "820380", "city": "Washington D.C.", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51s%2BpVKO3xL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
