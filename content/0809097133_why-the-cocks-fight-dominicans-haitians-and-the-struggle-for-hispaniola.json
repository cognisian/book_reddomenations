The author did a superb job enhancing the two countries history as well as explaining how one country relied on the other for goods and services....Her background warrants why she writes so well on such a niche subject, a minuscule island with two countries.  Michele used the strength of the Cock, to represent the many. She enhances the metaphor of cockfights to allow us the reader to see how societies still love to show power over another, a Machiavellian style still alive today. The ring, is the battle field. Like the Romans, the cocks wage war against another civilization. She also brings to the top the city of New York--How three countries forge into one. A terrific book, on a topic I was very unfamiliar with."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very informative and clearly written"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent!

They co-inhabit the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, but their histories are as deeply divided as their cultures: one French-speaking and black, one Spanish-speaking and mulatto. Yet, despite their antagonism, the two countries share a national symbol in the rooster--and a fundamental activity and favorite sport in the cockfight. In this book, Michele Wucker asks: \"If the symbols that dominate a culture accurately express a nation's character, what kind of a country draws so heavily on images of cockfighting and roosters, birds bred to be aggressive? What does it mean when not one but two countries that are neighbors choose these symbols? Why do the cocks fight, and why do humans watch and glorify them?\"\r\n\r\nWucker studies the cockfight ritual in considerable detail, focusing as much on the customs and histories of these two nations as on their contemporary lifestyles and politics. Her well-cited and comprehensive volume also explores the relations of each nation toward the United States, which twice invaded both Haiti (in 1915 and 1994) and the Dominican Republic (in 1916 and 1965) during the twentieth century. Just as the owners of gamecocks contrive battles between their birds as a way of playing out human conflicts, Wucker argues, Haitian and Dominican leaders often stir up nationalist disputes and exaggerate their cultural and racial differences as a way of deflecting other kinds of turmoil. Thus Why the Cocks Fight highlights the factors in Caribbean history that still affect Hispaniola today, including the often contradictory policies of the U.S.\r\n\r\n\u201cA complex exploration of the cultural divide between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Wucker . . . weaves together five centuries of tragic conflict with a subtle picture of the island today.\u201d The New York Times Book Review", "asin": "0809097133", "rank": "348136", "city": "Santo Domingo", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51OwUy2GkvL.jpg", "country": "D.R.", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
