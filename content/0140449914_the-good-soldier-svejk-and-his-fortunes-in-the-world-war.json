Classic Eastern European dry wit and ironic fatalism . . . the perfect attitude for an unenthusiastic soldier marching off to a war he doesn't understand, doesn't care to be involved in, and has nothing to gain by participating - except maybe a marble headstone with his name on it, if even that.  If you appreciate Eastern European \"dark humor\" in the vein of Kundera, Wolfe, Gogol, or Bulgakov, you'll love this work.  The same can be said for Kurt Vonnegut's \"Slaughterhouse Five,\" Joseph Heller's \"Catch-22,\" or Mark Twain's hilarious short story \"A History of a Campaign that Failed\" . . . appreciate the ironic, \"dark humor\" of these works, get \"The Good Soldier Svejk.\"  Highly recommended by this ex-professor of English and lover of sarcastic, raucous, and irreverent literature."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "700 pages of bliss"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very good buy and prompt delivery.

The story of a 'little man' caught in a vast bureaucratic machine, The Good Soldier \u0160vejk combines dazzling wordplay and piercing satire to create a hilariously subversive depiction of the futility of war. \r\n\r\nCecil Parrott's vibrant, unabridged and unbowdlerized translation is accompanied by an introduction discussing Ha\u0161ek's turbulent life as an anarchist, communist and vagranty, and the Everyman character of \u0160vejk.
