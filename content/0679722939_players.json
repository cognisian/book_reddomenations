Pammy and Lyle Wynant are an attractive, modern couple who seem to have it all. Yet behind their \"ideal\" life is a lingering boredom and quiet desperation: their talk is mostly chatter, their sex life more a matter of obligatory \"satisfaction\" than pleasure.

And still they remain untouched, \"players\" indifferent to the violence that surrounds them, and that they have helped to create. \r\n\r\nOriginally published in 1977 (before his National Book Award-winning White Noise and the recent blockbuster Underworld), Players is a fast-moving yet starkly drawn socially critical drama that demonstrates the razor-sharp prose and thematic density for which DeLillo is renowned today.\r\n\r\n\"The wit, elegance and economy of Don DeLillo's art are equal to the bitter clarity of his perceptions.\"--New York Times Book Review", "asin": "0679722939", "rank": "328158", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51houRUtXRL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
