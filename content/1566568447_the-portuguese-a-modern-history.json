It provides a concise and detailed history of Portugal by covering major events of the country's historic evolution. The main arguments flow logically and are easy to follow. The book includes many different and varied topics and it is pleasant to read. It shows how the country has evolved by describing major events that have shaped the society and culture of the country. The book even covers culinary, musical and folkloric traditions. Last but not least, it is written with love for Portugal and its people: the author feels blessed to live in Portugal.  For the author, Portugal constitutes a personal choice of life. The book is a very good introduction to the people and history of Portugal. I never felt bored reading it. I would highly recommend it to all those who would like to learn more about a country for which we know very little."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Interesting; easy to read too.

British correspondent/author with Portuguese wife writes in easily comprehensible style, giving the traveler insight into the country's history and culture.

I enjoyed the history."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a very informative book--very much Portugal from the inside out, full of nuggets that you won't get elsewhere (in English, anyway). If you're intrigued by the country and would like to go deeper--without having to wade into super heavy historical tomes, and maybe not even they would get you there--then this is the book. If you need a guide, look elsewhere--as there are plenty of reasonable ones."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I read Barry Hatton's book, The Portuguese: A Modern History, after a trip to Portugal this summer. I found his insights about the country, its people, and its place in the world's socio-economic pecking order (both historically and more recently) to be very similar to what I had noted during my time spent in the country.The book is less of a full-on historical textbook about the development of the nation, as it is a description of the evolution of a national psyche. It is the tracing of how the Portuguese are viewed by other's, and how they have viewed themselves, that makes Hatton's book so eminently readable. There is plenty of history. But there is also a good amount of discussion of less concrete topics; like that of saudade - a word that almost defies description, but is somewhat of a pleasantly painful melancholy (think of the feeling you get when listening to excellent blues music in the US - so sad, but so good).To really delve into Portuguese history, a book would likely have to be many times (or volumes) longer. But Hatton has not called his book Portugal: A Modern History. The title, using instead the word, 'Portuguese', is both clever and accurate in that it speaks of the people, and their collective psyche and temperament, and not the country itself. Some of the more compelling writing addresses how it is the Portuguese themselves who have stood in the way of their own development. And even as there has been realization of this problem, there existed an historical resignation to it.Hatton's offering is well worth a read for anyone interested in Portugal. It will both enlighten the reader and cultivate an enthusiasm to visit the gem known as Portugal."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "A muddled and disorganized book, a hopscotch of information sometimes as lost in direction as those brave souls who dared to crossed the ocean in the Age of Discovery."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Hatton writes a very well rounded historical account in a charming romantic style.

I have a history degree and teach history, so I like to know the background of a place before I travel.  This book was very easy to read, and did give a general history.  I definitely know more about Portugal now than I did before, however the writing is seriously flawed.  The author jumps around constantly and doesn't seem to finish one story before he moves on to the next. For example he mentions that the Spanish ruled over Portugal for a while, but never discusses how that ends or what happened while they were doing it.  In a chapter on Salazar he goes into a lengthy discussion of the current state of the Catholic Church in Portugal and their censorship over authors.  He also doesn't have a bibliography of any kind."}]}, "authors": ["Barry Hatton"], "isbn": "1566568447", "longitude": -9.1365061, "periods": ["1600s", "1700s", "1800s", "1900s", "2000s", "Recent Releases", "1500s"], "title": "The Portuguese: A Modern History", "word_cloud": "pleasant surprise provide concise detailed cover major event country historic evolution main argument flow logically easy follow include many different varied topic pleasant show country evolve describe major event shape society culture country even cover culinary musical folkloric tradition last least write love people author feel bless live author constitute personal choice life good introduction people never felt bored reading highly learn country know little interest easy read preparation trip wife write easily comprehensible style give traveler insight country culture anecdotes variety chapter topic bring present certain good supplement travel experience good enjoy informative much full nugget elsewhere anyway intrigue country deeper wade super heavy historical tome maybe even guide look elsewhere plenty reasonable one barry trip summer find insight country people place world peck order historically recently similar note time spend le historical textbook development nation description evolution national psyche trace portuguese view viewed make eminently readable plenty also good amount discussion le concrete topic saudade word almost defy description somewhat pleasantly painful melancholy think feel get listen excellent blue music sad good really portuguese likely many time volume longer call title use instead word clever accurate speaks people collective psyche temperament country compel writing address portuguese stand way development even realization problem exist historical resignation offering well anyone interested enlighten cultivate enthusiasm visit gem know muddled disorganized hopscotch information sometimes lose direction brave soul dare crossed ocean write well rounded historical account charm romantic style historical perspective interesting personal anecdote very readable good insight portuguese overview country planning visit travel summer want get brief overview country degree teach like know place travel easy give general definitely know however write seriously flaw author jump around constantly seem finish story move example mention rule never discuss end happen chapter go lengthy discussion current state censorship author also bibliography kind", "genres": ["History", "Travel Writing"], "summary": "Combining history and anecdote, Barry Hatton paints an intimate portrait of a fascinating country and its people.\r\n\r\nPortugal is an established member of the European Union, one of the founders of the euro currency and a founding member of NATO. Yet it is an inconspicuous and largely overlooked country on the continent's south-west rim.\r\n\r\nBarry Hatton shines a light on this enigmatic corner of Europe by blending historical analysis with entertaining personal anecdotes. He describes the idiosyncrasies that make the Portuguese unique and surveys the eventful path that brought them to where they are today.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth-and sixteenth-century Age of Discovery the Portuguese led Europe out of the Mediterranean into the Atlantic and they brought Asia and Europe together. Evidence of their one-time four-continent empire can still be felt, not least in the Portuguese language which is spoken by more than 220 million people from Brazil, across parts of Africa to Asia.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing present-day society and culture, The Portuguese also considers the nation's often tumultuous past. The 1755 Lisbon earthquake was one of Europe's greatest natural disasters, strongly influencing continental thought and heralding Portugal's extended decline. The Portuguese also weathered Europe's longest dictatorship under twentieth-century ruler Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Salazar. A 1974 military coup, called the Carnation Revolution, placed the Portuguese at the center of Cold War attentions. Portugal's quirky relationship with Spain, and with its oldest ally England, is also scrutinized.\r\n\r\nPortugal, which claims Europe's oldest fixed borders, measures just 561 by 218 kilometers. Within that space, however, it offers a patchwork of widely differing and beautiful landscapes. With an easygoing and seductive lifestyle expressed most fully in their love of food, the Portuguese also have an anarchical streak evident in many facets of contemporary life. \r\n\r\nA veteran journalist and commentator on Portugal, the author gives a thorough overview of his adopted country.", "asin": "1566568447", "rank": "99351", "city": "Lisbon", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qx-YbLRFL.jpg", "country": "Portugal", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
