This story takes place during the Spanish Civil War.  However, I could not finish the book because the translation from Catalan to English was poorly done. The translation became very distracting in the reader's understanding of the character's bio and the story line. This was a disappointment because I was very interested in delving into the  author's writing since I have had no knowledge of the Spanish Civil War and/or Spanish authors.  I would recommend another read possibly but via a different translation."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great book!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Wonderful, paced, realistic and cleverly written. You actually feel and observe a very different perspective on life and living through the misery caused by war. The characters described seem real. So does the misery and loss. Great and beautiful ending.I love that it was written in Catalan during the 60's, when one would not really hope to have many readers at all."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "just as described."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "It's a real life arc story, gains and losses all along the way, sometimes uncomfortable, realistically so, but with resolution. I read it while I was visiting in Barcelona and it felt authentic to place though it's set in another time. It has some beautiful lyrical passages, while being true to life in its harshness of the times, and how people dealt as best they could. Must be read with the times in mind. I thought it would be more political than it was. It was more human oriented through the eyes and emotions of the protaganist Natalia and what she cared about.  The Spanish Civil War was rather secondary. Women don't care that much about politics and the wars that result,  more about their man, their children, yet the harsh realities can make all that secondary as well. At some point she must care for both her survival and her sanity, and there were no mental health resources in that regard in that time.  It was sometimes depressing but its a good read. I've read the book is described as beautiful. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder in this case.  How does one write beautifully about the consequences of war, of what people have to go through during and after war? But i found it a good read, perhaps empowering even."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "You really have to know what was going on in Spain at the time to fully understand what was going on in this book.

Honestly, i liked it so much i bought an extra copy to share."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This 1986 novel brings the reader to the Civil War in Spain in the 1930's, a devastating war that plunged the people into poverty and despair.  Told through the eyes of a woman caught up in the tragedy of this war,  we first meet her as a young woman being courted and there are hints that this future marriage is not one made in heaven.  She has stars in her eyes but her husband is a bit of a brute, her mother-in-law is difficult to get along with, there is little money and she struggles to provide for her two young children who seem like a burden.  The family gets along somehow though and one of the ways they make their modest living is by raising doves.Suddenly, however, the Spanish Civil War is upon them and most of the men go off to war.  The woman now has to care for her children.  She has to go to work and leave them alone because they are almost starving and eventually have to kill the doves for food.This is a sad book and at times was hard to read.  Eventually, through the years, there are some changes but the husband never does return and even though the woman's life gets a little easier, I was depressed throughout this written classic which is a snapshot of a time and a place in history."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "A part de la mala traducci\u00f3 del t\u00edtol, aquesta \u00e8s una bona representaci\u00f3 del treball de Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda.
