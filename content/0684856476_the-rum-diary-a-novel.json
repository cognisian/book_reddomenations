It was a story about a young newspaper writer's time in Puerto Rico in the late 1950's, giving a lot of insight into why so many Puerto Ricans fled to New York at the time.  Interesting, realistic stories of life there at that time, full of craziness, drinking, sex and life in general."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I enjoyed it.

Thompson, The Rum Diary is a brilliantly tangled love story of jealousy, treachery, and violent alcoholic lust in the Caribbean boomtown that was San Juan, Puerto Rico, in the late 1950s. \r\n\r\nThe narrator, freelance journalist Paul Kemp, irresistibly drawn to a sexy, mysterious woman, is soon thrust into a world where corruption and get-rich-quick schemes rule and anything (including murder) is permissible. \r\n\r\nExuberant and mad, youthful and energetic, this dazzling comedic romp provides a fictional excursion as riveting and outrageous as Thompson\u2019s Fear and Loathing books.", "asin": "0684856476", "rank": "44989", "city": "Puerto Rico", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51A-kFAe3ZL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
