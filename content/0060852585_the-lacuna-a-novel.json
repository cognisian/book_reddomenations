Kingsolver wields the English language like a maestro. One finds on nearly every page a phrase, a sentence, a passage, that brings the story of writer/cook/stenographer/artist\u2019s assistant Harrison William Shepherd alive in living, breathing, heart rending color. In so doing, Kingsolver manages to render one man\u2019s life as if it were a mosaic made all the more beautiful for the various and mysterious missing pieces. Supporting players include renowned artists Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, as well as Russian revolutionary, Leon Trotsky. The novel is set in Mexico during the 1930s and early 40s, and later in the U.S.A. during the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings of the late 40s/early 50s. \u201cThe Lacuna\u201d truly is a modern classic."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "This is not my style of book so I can not give it a good rating.

One features a vibrant Mexican landscape with the equally colorful personalities of Rivera, Kahlo, and Trotsky. The other centers more on Harrison's reclusive existence in small-town America and his battle with the House Un-American Activities Committee. Despite the prodigious research that both parts exhibit, critics clearly preferred the former, marveling at Kingsolver's lyrical passages and her expert recreation of 1930s Mexico. A few reviewers also noted instances of sermonizing and inaccurate history. However, the novel's compelling, engrossing story certainly outweighed these minor complaints, and in the end, Kingsolver has created a convincing \"tableau vivant of epochs and people that time has transformed almost past recognition\" \r\n\r\nNew York Times Book Review", "asin": "0060852585", "rank": "73666", "city": "Mexico City", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gtCK-hTiL.jpg", "country": "Mexico", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
