This book is wrongly acclaimed to be an example of excellent writing by a Middle Eastern author. It is, in fact, a book that promotes Islamic Extremist ideology, is anti Women's Rights, is anti Homosexual. One of the main characters in this book is raped, forced to undertake the role of prostitute, and is then battered by another of the main characters, out of a decried sense of retribution based on Islamic Extremist values.I read this book as part of an Introductory level Middle Eastern Cultures College course I took as an elective. The reading was not guided and I was absolutely insulted when fellow class members laughed off the \"hot and sexy\" scenes which were in fact rape scenes. This book does no one any good to read without forewarning of the alarmingly violent and detail depicted rape scene and an understanding that this book serves only to prejudice one against the entire Western World for its destructive influence. This book should not be part of any educational lesson plan without the presence of guided reading lessons; the violence, the sexual bigotry, the religious nature of the story, require that student's of any level, be walked through the circumstances, the past and current acceptance of depicted situations analyzed, and explanation of why this book is important to the class' subject area. At no point, should this be included in an Introductory level course about Middle Eastern Cultures, as it paints an outdated and dangerous view of those cultures, especially in regards to those cultures' participation in the Western World.Please consider these things before reading this book or considering it as required or recommended reading for a class."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Never have I read such novels as those of Mahfouz.  The very strange mixture of religious cliches being spewed out of his characters as they manipulate, degrade, humiliate, drink to get drunk, murder and struggle.  If these tales are based on Mahfouz's experiences, then I wonder about the hypocrisy that seems so deeply embedded in these Muslim characters.  Hypocrisy isn't the sole guardian of such Islam, for it is also prevalent in Christianity, Judaism, and other religions.  His novels, as does this one, leave me wondering if there is any hope for human beings.  I'm not surprised that an assassin attempted to murder him for religious blasphemy.  Once again, in my mind, the hypocrisy of so many religious people; they turn to murder rather than forgiveness."}]}, "authors": ["Naguib Mahfouz"], "isbn": "0385264763", "longitude": 31.243666, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "Midaq Alley", "word_cloud": "great excessively note annotation exciting story well developed character seem plot interest unexpected turn very well write brings together nicely different character live fantastic originally buy class fell definite definitely learned lot recommend learn little bit knowledge order appreciate plot author buy need write review history enjoy read good life lesson fictional story take place era wrongly acclaimed example excellent write author fact promote ideology anti anti main character rap forced undertake role prostitute batter main character decry sense retribution base part level course take elective reading guide absolutely insult fellow class member laugh hot sexy scene fact rape scenes good forewarn alarmingly violent detail depict rape scene understand serf prejudice entire western destructive influence part educational lesson plan presence guide reading lesson violence sexual bigotry religious nature story require student level walk circumstance past current acceptance depict situation analyze explanation important class subject area point include level course paint outdated dangerous view culture especially regard culture participation western consider thing read consider require recommended reading class never novels strange mixture religious cliche spew character manipulate degrade humiliate drink get drunk murder struggle tale base experience wonder hypocrisy seem deeply embed character sole guardian also prevalent religions novel leave wonder hope human being surprise assassin attempt murder religious blasphemy mind hypocrisy many religious people turn murder rather forgiveness", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature"], "summary": "Widely acclaimed as Naguib Mahfouz's best novel, Midaq Alley brings to life one of the hustling, teeming back alleys of Cairo in the 1940s. From Zaita the cripple-maker to Kirsha the hedonistic cafe owner, from Abbas the barber who mistakes greed for love to Hamida who sells her soul to escape the alley, from waiters and widows to politicians, pimps, and poets, the inhabitants of Midaq Alley vividly evoke Egypt's largest city as it teeters on the brink of change. Never has Nobel Prize-winner Mahfouz's talent for rich and luxurious storytelling been more evident than here, in his portrait of one small street as a microcosm of the world on the threshold of modernity.\r\n\r\n\"Naguib Mahfouz virtually invented the novel as an Arab form. He excels at fusing deep emotion and soap opera.\" The New York Times \r\n", "asin": "0385264763", "rank": "81644", "city": "Cairo", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Zu6qoOphL.jpg", "country": "Egypt", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
