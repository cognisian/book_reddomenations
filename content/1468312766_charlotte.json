Newly free, she spent two years in almost total solitude, creating a series of autobiographical art\u2014images, words, even musical scores\u2014that together tell her life story. A pregnant Charlotte was killed in Auschwitz at the age of 26, but not before she entrusted her life's work to a friend, who kept it safe until peacetime. The result, an extraordinary novel avant la lettre, was eventually published as Life? or Theatre? (and now reissued by Overlook), a unique, relentlessly complete artistic expression.\r\n\r\nIn Charlotte, David Foenkinos\u2014with passion, life, humor, and intelligent observation\u2014has written his own utterly original tribute to Charlotte Salomon's tragic life and transcendent art. His gorgeous, haunting, and ultimately redemptive novel is the result of a long-cherished desire to honor this young artist. Infused with the emotion of a writer who connects deeply with his subject, and masterfully and sensitively translated by Sam Taylor, Charlotte is a triumph of creative expression, a monument to genius stilled too soon, and an ode to the will to survive.\r\n\r\n\"Astounding . . . Foenkinos makes us a part of this hopefully growing community: that of the admirers of a young artist named Charlotte Salomon, assassinated when she was 26 years old.\" L'Express", "asin": "1468312766", "rank": "453625", "city": "Berlin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51msDkx3RsL.jpg", "country": "Germany", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
