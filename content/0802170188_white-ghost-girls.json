The second half of the book was better than the first half. While the book was narrated by a child I didn't believe that a child would have had those thoughts. I later learned that the book started out as a biography and then turned into a fictional novel. That explains the change about half way through the book. It wasn't bad but I think it could or should have been better. Our facilitator for the book club said that the author's second book was much better."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A beautifully written and lyrical account of a young girl's coming-of-age in Hong Kong during the Vietnam War era. The story, littered with the flavors of the Hong Kong and imagined Vietnam landscapes, is filled with loss, failure, desperation, and heat,humidity, colors and smells of an exotic and, at times, dangerous location. The writing is so dreamy, the images so vivid that it's impossible not to get sucked down inside this hazy and unstable world. Narrated by Katie, the youngest sister, the sections between the two sisters are heartbreaking and wise, bittersweet and honest beyond Katie's years.But it is the writing that pulls the story forward. \"Kissing the deaf boy is like tasting the sea,\" Greenway writes. \"It's like forgiveness.\"And later, \"Even my mother's afraid. Afraid of Frankie's body, the raw, animal power of her daughter's want. Overwhelming. Devouring. So hungry, it excludes everything else.\"\"White Ghost Girls\" is a powerful and haunting read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "very nice but sad book- Fast shipping"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This is a lovely book, double-filtered through the eyes of a grown woman looking back and re-living the memories of a thirteen-year-old girl. Sometimes the action is literally underwater;  sometimes it only feels that way, as Kate and her sister Frankie move languorously through the thick, humid air of a Hong Kong summer. The relationships between Kate, her sister, their parents, their Chinese nanny, and others are seen as though through the limited awareness and understanding of a 13-year-old, but always shadowed by the grown-up Kate's awareness of what ultimately will happen. The book is short and not a word is wasted.  Why only four stars?  Because I wanted to know more about the grownup Kate, and how the events of this summer echoed down the canyons of her life.  We get a hint,  not enough. But maybe that's another book."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I just finished reading this book for a bookclub and will read it again for the sheer beauty of the writing.

The girl's mother, often overwhelmed with the war, and reality itself, seeks comfort in painting.  In her paintings she created an alternative \"now\" and she fully embraces it and wishes her daughters would too.The girls are watched mainly by their amah (a woman employed as a servant) and find it quite easy to escape beyond her attention, and do exploring of this world they live in on their own.  While swimming they find a floating body of a Chinese girl and at that point their innocence seems to take a turn.  As the summer progresses, Frankie becomes more reckless and an incident causes someone to die and younger sister Kate becomes the keeper of secrets.'  '  'Taking a deep breath, I have to honestly say it took me a couple of times to get going into this book.  While written in almost a poetic manner (page one was beautifully written), I found it to almost drone on and I was lost within the words - and not within the story.The book is told by younger sister Kate. Kate is 12.  The sisters left under so little supervision get into a lot of trouble, especially Frankie who lacks the parental attention she needs, starts to find it in the male friends of her fathers.  I found myself on one hand angry at their mother for being so absent, buried in her paintings while her daughters strayed into dangerous areas, and on the other hand taking pity on the woman who was obviously overwhelmed by all that had become of her dreams.While I never found the book riveting, in the end I have to say I am glad I read it.  My favorite part of this read was the incredible detailing.  Author Alice Greenway writes of a Hong Kong that I could see with vivid colors and descriptive smells that made me feel as thought I was standing outside the bakery myself peering in at two sisters, Kate and Frankie.A poetic type read that I am glad I picked up and finished.  In reality, a wonderful first novel."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Strong characters, vivid descriptions of Hongkong scenes, good pacing - I still can't believe this is her first novel.
