They all say the same thing, the devastating drawbacks to this book and this twisted author.  Namely, the book is mostly boring, inane dialog between people who are saying a bunch of shallow things that don't matter.  They could be saying something entirely different, doesn't make a bit of difference.  It's all useless, pointless babble, drivel, designed to fill pages.And Kanon's writing style is incredibly pompous and smug.  He has no use for standard sentence structure, instead he thinks he's so awesome with his cute little style.  He tries to be \"hip\" and \"cool\" by using clipped, incomplete sentences of maybe just 3 or 4 words, sentences that ignore all the rules of grammar in the English language.  It is highly irritating, distracting, and unforgivably STUPID.Add to this NO character development, you couldn't care less about anybody in this book.  And very little narrative or plot development to boot.  Another John LeCarre, my a***!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great story.

The plot is very involved and one must pay attention to Kanon's somewhat understated style, but in the end, you will conclude that it was a good novel with a satisfactory outcome.
