Rather than the meticulously observed approach of those two masterpieces, All My Friends often settles for kookiness and offbeat characters, which can be amusing but gives off a sense of an author more into crowd-pleasing than truth-telling.The first-person voice is also, I think, a mistake, as it puts too much onus on the central character, Danny Deck, to carry things. While Moving On also focused on a central character, Patsy Carpenter (Deck is briefly alluded to in that book as Patsy in this one) the third person voice allowed the narrative to stretch to other characters and perspectives, fleshing out Patsy in the context of her world. That kind of context is missing here.Danny is an aspiring writer, apparently the creatively exhausted McMurtry\u2019s alter ego, who comes to question the value of his work. He also flounders in his relationships with women, though that doesn\u2019t keep him laying just about every prominent female character at one time or another.This is not to say that this is a bad book. By most authors\u2019 standards it would be excellent. There are some wonderful scenes ranging from laugh-out-loud comic (Uncle Laredo) to creepily disturbing (the Texas Rangers). It\u2019s just that McMurtry had set the bar so high in his previous two efforts that All My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers suffers in comparison."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I never like a good book to end, but I felt this book's ending left too much unsaid...however the title may have said enough."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Not one of McMurtry's finer works.."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "McMurtry writes characters like nobody's business, and this novel is no exception.
