The rest of the book, along with the main story line were SO boring. Then there were lots of bold random headlines, emails, word lists, and unnecessary filler that I wasn't sure exactly what Coupland was trying to do.There was also some 4th wall breaking, in which characters talked about Douglas Coupland. I usually like that kind of thing, but it kind of fell flat here for me.I kept checking Kindle's progress bar each time I turned a page, hoping to be almost done."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is my favorite book. There is really no way to predict the plot-- or the amazing one-liners and trips down the rabbit hole of nostalgic tech culture. It's also a great study on what happens to Gen X and Y when they grow up-- and the absurdity of the world around us.

The characters are products of their era even as they\u2019re creating it. \r\n\r\nEverybody in Ethan\u2019s life inhabits a moral grey zone. Nobody is exempt, not even his seemingly strait-laced parents or Coupland himself, as readers will see.\r\n\r\nFull of word games, visual jokes and sideways jabs, this book throws a sharp, pointed lawn dart into the heart of contemporary life. jPod is Douglas Coupland at the top of his game.", "asin": "1596911050", "rank": "558021", "city": "Vancouver", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-ezIXdkML.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
