Her writing makes you feel you are there. A must read!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "As the title says, it's a bit uneven but still a worthy read.  I've read other comments that the author name-drops continuously, but how else was she to tell this story?  She comes to NY at the exact time that other artists are coming into their own. They were part of her story.As for her relationship with Maplethorp, well, it's just beautifully and lovingly told. This was as remarkable and enduring relationship as any other in the arts. Reading about it was a privilege."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I've read this book so many times.  First in print.  Then I bought the Kindle edition for my phone so I could have it with me always.  Then I saw that there was an unabridged Audible edition that was read by Patti Smith herself.  Her reading is sublime.  And its on my phone and always with me too.  I wish more authors read their own work.  (Toni Morrison has read nearly all of her own books on Audible.)"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Like the blue star that lit their way, Patti and Robert were destined to shine in the heavens with their greatness and celestial beauty. Their story is one of timeless love. A memorable, exquisite read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This memoir by Patti Smith of her time as a starving artist in New York in the 1970s and her friendship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe is both surprisingly tender and quite matter of fact.  From listening to her music, I expected this to be much different, more political, more cynical, more philosophical and more \"in your face.\"  Like punk music.  Instead, she has written a tender memoir of her time in New York City at the beginning of her career, and Mapplethorpe's.  The book is also a love story regarding Patti and Robert, despite their conflicting sexual choices. Both had their own  intense artistic vision, but protected the other's work.  Highly recommended, especially to those with an interest in Smith, Mapplethorpe, the punk music scene, or New York in the 1970s."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A beautiful book.
