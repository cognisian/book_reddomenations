The interview was fascinating and because I'm soon headed to a job in Prague, I felt I should check it out.I am well familiar with the evils and absurdities of communism, so I didn't find much that was surprising in Klima's memoir.  Nonetheless he is a compelling storyteller and caused me to wonder repeatedly if the world he was describing in communist Czechoslovakia - and the whole paradigm of creating a \"new socialist man\" - wasn't some big joke.  Unfortunately not, for those who lived under it.I give it four stars only because I felt that even at nearly 500 pages, the book seems a little short - perhaps too much lost in the abridgment from the much-longer Czech edition.  If you can read Czech, I would suggest getting that one on your next visit to Prague."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I have read a few things about the Czech runner Emil Zatopek, and have been disappointed that I never learned about how he dealt with the Communist regime (from 1948-1989). Zatopek flourished as runner in the late-40's to early-50's, sympathized with the Prague Spring, and was internally exiled until 1989. This memoir by Klima has a lot to say about how he managed under communism. Not that it was necessarily like the way Zatopek managed, but there were probably similarities. Klima had a great desire to stay in his homeland, so despite having opportunities to leave, he remained. In fact he was teaching in the US in 1968-69, and still chose to return after the crackdown. He did belong to the communist party for a time in the 1950's, mostly naively. But mostly he managed to live in a kind of grey zone that allowed him to write but not collaborate. It wasn't until the last years of the communist regime that he became pretty strongly identified with the dissidents.Apparently Klima wrote a 2-volume memoir, of which this is an abridged 1-volume version. The publishers suggest they might publish the 2 volumes (in translation) at some point, but don't promise. I don't know what more there is, but the book under review ends in 1989 with the Velvet Revolution. It would be interesting to hear about his life since then. Though everyone is in favor of freedom, it has its downsides. E.g., writers under oppression have deep issues to write about. Freedom eliminates some of those issues, and can present a challenge to creativity. Also, we have a friend who is roughly my age who grew up in CZ and was in her 30's in 1989. She confessed to Kathy and me once that she had not been prepared to make life choices for herself, and found freedom rather difficult. So, it would be interesting to know Klima's experience of freedom, which he gained at age 58.Klima knew interesting people such as Havel and Kundera pretty well. Unfortunately he has little to say about them, beyond mentioning the times they intersect his life. But there are no personal accounts of them. That is perhaps understandable in the case of Kundera, since he is still alive, but you'd think he could share more about Havel. Perhaps there is some of this in the stuff that was edited out--but I doubt it, since that would have made good copy.In sum, this was good as far as it went, but there was a lot further I would have liked it to go."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I was interested in reading this book because it happened as I was coming of age in the US.  Another reminder of how quickly life can change when people without morals are in power.  It also reconfirms the weakness and fear of humankind which I believe accounts for the misery former friends and colleagues can inflict on you when they feel threatened.  In the end, very few will stand up against tyranny."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I gave up reading it as I got lost in the first 4 chapters.  I just am not math intelligent.

It came as a surprise when his family was transported to the Terez\u00edn concentration camp\u2014and an even greater surprise when most of them survived. They returned home to a city in economic turmoil and falling into the grip of Communism. Against this tumultuous backdrop, Kl\u00edma discovered his love of literature and matured as a writer. \r\n\r\nBut as the regime further encroached on daily life, arresting his father and censoring his work, Kl\u00edma recognized the party for what it was: a deplorable, colossal lie. The true nature of oppression became clear to him and many of his peers, among them Josef \u0160kvoreck\u00fd, Milan Kundera, and V\u00e1clav Havel. \r\n\r\nFrom the brief hope of freedom during the Prague Spring of 1968 to Charter 77 and the eventual collapse of the regime in 1989\u2019s Velvet Revolution, Kl\u00edma\u2019s revelatory account provides a profoundly rich personal and national history.", "asin": "0802121705", "rank": "128775", "city": "Prague", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q8d2Gzm2L.jpg", "country": "Czechia", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
