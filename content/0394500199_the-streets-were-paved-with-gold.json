Not this one, though. Ken Auletta spreads a three-paragraph editorial's worth of insight over 330 pages, attempting to analyze the New York City financial crisis of the late 1970s.  He should have started with a history of the crisis, but he doesn't. He should have interviewed major players, but he doesn't. He should have put the problem in the context of broader challenges in municipal and sovereign finance in the late 1970s, but he doesn't. Instead, we get rambling repetitive ruminations over why New York City politicians borrowed so much money, and why nobody tried to stop them. The answer, Auletta concludes, was \"politics.\" It's sophomoric.Auletta did get an interview with Daniel Patrick Moynihan to discuss the City's financial problems, but his description of their conversation makes clear that he was bored by Moynihan and did not take him seriously.There was one interesting revelation in the book, something that perhaps people knew at the time but which was news to me -- when the city's problems started becoming clear to the large banks that intermediated its bond sales, they responded by selling their own bond holdings to their customers, much as some banks responded during the recent MBS crisis.I do not recommend this book."}]}, "authors": ["Ken Auletta"], "isbn": "0394500199", "longitude": 0.0, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "The streets were paved with gold", "word_cloud": "seem larger life history excite important not spread editorial worth insight page attempt analyze financial crisis late start history crisis interview major player put problem context broader challenge municipal sovereign finance late instead ramble repetitive rumination politician borrow much money nobody try answer conclude politics interview discuss financial problem description conversation make clear bored interest revelation something perhaps people know time news city problem start become clear large bank intermediate bond sale respond sell bond holding customer much bank respond recent recommend", "genres": ["History", "Politics"], "summary": "How - and why - did one of the world's greatest cities come to be teetering on the edge of bankruptcy? Ken Auletta, writer for THE NEW YORKER and columnist for THE DAILY NEWS, shows how the decline of New York City was partly inevitable --- the result of shifting migration patterns and rapidl technological innovations --- and partly caused by anarchic political and economic factions, each angling for its own advantage. His lucid examination also pinpoints the core of New York City's problems --- the failure of liberal democratic government --- and explores what this will mean for the future of all American cities.\r\n\r\n\"A tremendously impressive combination of reporting and analysis that illuminates not only New York's situation, but also the most basic trends in the politics and economy of the nation as a whole\" - James Fallows, Washington Editor, THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY", "asin": "0394500199", "rank": "1870054", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51aoIz-RmwL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
