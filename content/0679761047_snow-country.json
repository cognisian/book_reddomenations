I just didn't care about any of them. The man was too self centered and lived a purposeless life, one woman was always on the verge of hysteria (too emotional and a drama queen) the other too suppressed and unable to manage her emotional life. Of course these characters were created to bring us into the world of oldtime Japan but as a modern day woman, I could not imagine being either woman nor caring for such a shallow man. However the visual rural scenes of Japan in the winter and spring were quite beautiful."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Cliches in description. No character development.

I have to admit, I was immediately drawn to the title, the description, the acclaim of the Noble Prize in literature, etc. Furthermore, we hadn't read a \"love story\" for book club since I joined, so to say that I was looking forward to reading this would be a slight understatement.  My initial impression of the writing sadly carried through to the end of the book. The writing is austere and lacking poignancy in both diction and syntax. I would argue that not only is it \"simple\" - which can be stunningly effective - but it's simplistic, almost as if the work had been translated by someone who knew limited English. I was shocked to read the reviews about how \"masterfully\" this book is written. Aside from a few vaguely captivating descriptions of \"the snow\" and \"the country\", there are few redeeming qualities to this book. The characters are undeveloped, flat, and one dimensional.  The premise of this story could take one so deeply into the human condition, and yet, leaves so much unexplored.  The one dimensional pusillanimous portrayal of the feminine - while perhaps historically and culturally valid - left me feeling, how should I say this...pissed off.  The female heroin is bland and weak. Her utterances and actions alike reek of rueful adolescent desperation.  It was hard to get past this. The dialogue is perhaps the most torturous part of the book. Reading the dialogue sections evoked the image of a little man searching the dictionary for the right translation, but deciding that it was taking to long, and instead falling back on repeating the trite, familiar words over and over and over again."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "good reprint"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Doomed relationship between a geisha and a wealthy, shallow dilettante.
