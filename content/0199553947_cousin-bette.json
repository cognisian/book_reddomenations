This book's soap opera like plot seems to grind on and on...the second half of the book is particularly trying and the plot is full of holes. There is also a lot of sloppiness-- for instance Balzac forgot what age he assigned Baron Hulot earlier in the book....suddenly in the space of a paragraph he goes from 63 to 70 even though only 3 years have passed. This book cries to be edited down.This novel wanders and especially loses your interest in the interminable second half....the scene where the Brazilian finds out about Mme. Marneffe is particularly bad--- other comments remark on the bookkeeper like listing of money all of it meant to impress a la Dallas--I had to force myself to read the last hundred pages. The surprise ending was unexpected although it is famous---I remember having heard of it--a man of 80 clutching the servant girl promising to make her a baroness...I may read a less long Balzac in French and see if there in lies most of the problem...(the translation)...I suspect not. The Red and the Black by Stendahl was written earlier 1830 and it quit a bit better (but beware the Charter House of Parma (much later Stendahl) is truly terrible!...also Zola (1870-1900) is an author who is leagues more sophisticated particularly certain of his novels like The Soil.The bad translations were said to have killed off Jules Verne who was never that popular in the english sphere as he was else where.I think most of the problem is the sophistication of the average reader has increased dramatically since 1840s and the author'swrote to make money often in serial format... The readers of today are much more sophisticated and the authors also infinitely more sophisticated...e.g. the stupid part about the Brazil and the Brazilian just show an ignorance of the world....but I kept reminding myself ..  The Congo River was not discovered until the 1870s...30 years after this novel was written.I enjoyed Balzac's critique of taste.....good art versus bad art... it is also shallow.  Well we are so smart now eh??2 stars is all I can muster for this thing.  Try Zola instead."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Great depiction of life in France in 1840s among the bourgeoisie.  Social and economic striving and acute income disparities.  Highly amusing social commentary rather than psychological exploration,"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I stopped reading after the first half of the novel when I realized that only more of the same would be endured.  The frequency with which the cash-obsessed Balzac mentions a specific sum of money is amusing, then exasperating.  Simply try to find five pages in a row where he does not cite \"300,000 francs\", \"80,000 francs\" , \"192,000 francs\" or some other hefty sum in dowries, loans, debts, cost of furnishings, etc.  Deception and adultery are also tiresomely repeated throughout the implausible plot, which is solely concerned with money and philandering.  This is far from realism and indeed stalls at the level of mere soap opera.  Has there ever been another novelist that writes about money so persistently?  I remember that cash also was a main character in his better novel \"Lost Illusions\".  I have lost my illusion and I am weary with Monsieur Balzac.  I bid him adieu."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "To me, Balzac is the French George Eliot. In Cousin Bette, there are so many memorable quotes, just as many as in Middlemarch. The plot is terribly complicated, but worth the read."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I guess people in the 19th Century had alot of time on their hands to spend reading a long book that goes over the same material again and again.I read this as a book on tape.  The book for me was alittle longish and dull so I doubt I would have been able to read it in its hardcopy form without giving up on it. However, thanks to books on tape, I was able to stick with the book until its end.Yes, do read the book!  Apparently Balzac, poor fellow, was himself a victim to debts and even penury.  I read in the bio that he never made much money from his writing.  I was sorry to hear that.  In this book there are innumerable mentions about the financial plight of his characters----their debts,  going into debt, mortgages on houses that can't be paid, borrowing money that can't be repaid, the threat of debtors prison and arrest imminent.  So, if you think you have \"financial problems\" your \"problems\" will seem miniscule compared with the characters in this book!Yes, this book is worth reading as long as you are patient and don't get bored too easily. I at first gave it 3 stars but then I felt sorry for Balzac so I raised it up to 4---I suppose a 3.5 would be more a more accurate guage of my opinion about this book.  Actually, it is well written.  Don't let me dissuade you from giving it a try.  You'll find alot in the book to enjoy and you will learn about what life was like in Paris during the first part of the 1800's.  The courtesans sounded interesting to me...but don't tell my wife!  :o)  Email Boland7214@aol.co"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Balzac is so much fun!  He would be great to invite to dinner.  Please read this book - you will enjoy it.  The other reviews here go on at great length.

It's so much fun to watch the contemptible Bette manipulate everyone around her, and to follow her pathetic and ill-placed obsession for a certain young Polish character who marries her young, beautiful cousin. Everything fun is in this book-courtesans, lecherous old men, unfaithful young lovers, and of course, the virtuous, who get treated terribly and die abandoned and alone.  Wretched Bette dies loved and valued.  You will have a lot of fun reading this book and enjoying-and getting disgusted with-all the characters."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "*Cousin Bette*, or Part One of 'Poor Relations,' is considered to be Honore de Balzac's last great novel, the capstone on an oeuvre that spanned nearly a hundred novels.  The author had already begun to ail from overwork by the time of its composition (1846-1847), his methods of genius - sixteen-hour writing days, coupled with crushing \"motivational\" debt and a penchant for gallons of black coffee - exacting a toll of stress that would claim his life three years later.  But if the physical shell was failing, the instrument of the mind retained its strength and perception, as *Cousin Bette*, equal and in some ways superior to Balzac's other masterworks (*Lost Illusions*, *Pere Goirot*), gives ample testament.  Of the ten or so works I've read of this French master, this novel was the easiest to dive into and, overall, the most spellbinding and page-turning, no doubt influenced by the manner of its creation.For although Balzac had published a sixteen-volume set of The Human Comedy by the mid 1840's, he had not found the accolades his oeuvre so justly deserved; in fact, he stood in the shadow of Eugene Sue, at the time an enormously popular author who serialized his work in easy tidbits.  The serialization of novels had only come about recently, with Dickin's *Pickwick Papers* and Balzac's *The Old Maid* appearing first in 1836.  The catch, however, was that Balzac was not an author to chop up and present in segments: his novels work best as a slow, steady read, the tension and enjoyment arising through hundreds of devoured pages until climax and, usually, a pessimistic but realistic denouement.  Thus: Sue wrote for the serial; Balzac wrote for himself, and suffered accordingly.  The man's ego had to have taken a bruising:\"The present situation requires me to write two or three masterful works which will topple the false gods of this bastard literature, and which must demonstrate that I am younger, fresher, and greater writer than ever before!\"Vainglorious statements, perhaps, yet proven true by ink, sweat and the stench of unroasted coffee beans: Balzac set to work, composing *Cousin Pons* and *Cousin Bette* as the final duology of his vast sociology opus, emerging from the toil with a final masterpiece and a very good companion novel.  Moreover, *Bette* benefited greatly from the conformity to serialization, making it a rare and unique jewel upon the author's tiara.An experienced reader can spot the difference almost immediately.  In every other novel I've read of the Human Comedy, the first forty to fifty pages are usually devoted to detailing the histories of the main characters and the environments they exist in.  This helps to firmly delineate the particulars in the brain, and makes the resultant tragedy and sarcastic farce all the more potent - yet difficult, I would imagine, for serial readers to cope with.  In *Bette*, however, we are thrown into the action immediately with the arrival of self-made magnate Captain Crevel to the House of Baron Hulot.  Without preamble he relates to the Baron's wife, the long-suffering and almost intolerably virtuous Adeline Hulot de'Evry, that her husband has stolen his mistress and, as revenge, Crevel plans on making the Baroness his own mistress - tit for tat! To secure his claim, Crevel dangles the financial future of the Baroness' daughter over her head.  The heated tension of this scene plunges the reader into the meat of the novel without them really realizing it: within one chapter we encounter the stigmatizing standards of high society, the lecherous egos of middle-aged adventurers, the wiles of the courtesan and the depths human beings will sink to reach a personal desire, a feverish vendetta; themes developed continually as the novel progresses through its almost 500 pages of psychological examination and high-drama theatrics.  At the heart of it all, spinning her webs like a black widow, is the negative force of Cousin Bette, the plain-faced, masculine cousin of Baroness Adeline.  Slights of the past, and of the present, gnaw at Bette's heart; she will employ the tactics of Machiavelli to destroy her family and benefactors, at any cost.  A truly frightening creature, this Bette...and *almost* sympathetic, for the origin of her vengeance can be easily understood, if not forgiven.  Thus the genius of Balzac shines through, painting gray within the villainous portrait, defying the archetypes serials require, all the while fashioning a set of character-clich\u00e9s that epitomize the genre, from the hooker with the heart of gold to that murderously unpredictable Brazilian...Yet Balzac had more on his mind than simple plot-dynamics. The introduction of the novel compares the twin passions of the Baron de'Evry (eternal skirt-chaser) and Cousin Bette (the spinster) with the Freudian concepts of eros and thanatos - one ever questing the physical act of love, and in that quest ruining all those who love and esteem him; and the other, twisted by the wrench of unrequited obsession, deliberately plotting a horrific revenge:\"(Introduction): Freud, in his later works, presented eros and thanatos [sic] as two sides of the same coin.  Almost a century earlier, Balzac had imagined them as two members of the same family.\"The best literature is timeless: modern readers can glean important lessons about life from the dusty pages of centuries-past.  Balzac is timeless.  He paints the French society in broad strokes, but never neglects the details; he tackles the essential quandaries and inconsistencies of human behavior with a sardonic - though never superior - tone.  *Cousin Bette*'s ending, wherein we discover that the leopard cannot change its spots, will all at once inspire anguished tears, astonished laughter and a knowing shake of the head.Highest Recommendation."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "When Balzac set out to describe the entirety of human emotion, occupation, education, society and mores in France he focused many of the novels on life in Paris.  While some may view this book as \"soap\", it nevertheless artfully describes the incredible social undercurrents, from the high to the low, within Parisian life in that time (1830's).  Rich, and aspiring rich men, really did keep courtesans and flaunted their trophies in the same way the rich do today.  Their wives often tacitly tolerated these relations even when their husbands displayed their girlfriends in public.  Men also came to Paris from the outlying areas to achieve success, fame and become wealthy.  Balzac writes vividly about all of this and frames the story within plots and subplots that are interesting and realistic. I hope you enjoy reading it."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Balzac's brilliant commentary on the newly born French republic and the struggle for power underneath Napoleon as the old order was guillotined and enterprise had free reign is a marvellous expose of a society in flux. Opening with subtle alacrity the novo homo Monsieur Crevel pays a visit to his son-in-law's mother, the aristocratic Baroness Hulot d'Ervy to explain that his reason (as a tied member of their family now through her son) behind his hindrance of supplying the Baroness' daughter, Hortense, with financial surety is due to two reasons: The first due to the vast debts his son-in-law has run up which he must cover, the second, in an delightfully narrated scene of wickedly humorous selfishness, because the Baroness' husband (his libertine comrade-in-arms) has `stolen' away Monsieur Crevel's mistress, the now infamous singer, Josepha.Monsieur Crevel insists that he must have the Baroness himself to avenge himself on her husband and, if she agrees, he will act as financial surety for her daughter Hortense. So, in true Balzac style, in the space of a few pages, we have a marvellously huge dilemma for the cuckolded Baroness for whom, within this society, social standing is everything. It is this sense of stolen love, echoing Moliere whom Balzac constantly refers to, that permeates the novel of revenge that is Cousin Bette.What unfolds is a perfidy to subtle and over such a long period of time that its eventual terrible denouement is a tragic tale of requited love, treacherous money motivated mistresses and selflessly loving wives.Cousin Bette has saved from suicide one Wencelas Steinbock, a Polish refugee, and has secreted him away in her tiny home for a few months financially caring for him whilst he begins to exercise his professed enormous artistic talent. Eventually she leaks her secret to her niece, Hortense who promptly falls in love with Wencelas and steals him away to marry her. In the interim, Josepha spurns Baron Hulot, who promptly turns his attentions to Madame Marneffe who lives next door to Cousin Bette. It is with Madame Marneffe that Cousin Bette finds the terrible instrument of he revenge as she inserts her into the Hulot social circle, Baron Hulot taking up with her and his lavish spending on his innocent mistress driving then entire family to penury. Madame Marneffe then comes to an agreement with Crevel to become his mistress thus stealing her from Baron Hulot and gaining his revenge on Hulot's stealing of Josepha. In the meantime the bewitching Marneffe secures herself more and more money from the slavering old men whilst carrying on with her returned Brazilian lover. Cousin Bette then gets Wencelas to obtain a loan from Madame Marneffe, knowing full well that he would fall in love with her causing Hortense's misery (and her mother's) to be absolute. By midpoint of the novel the plot is well in motion, the Hulot family is torn apart through husbands betrayals, their money is gone, wasted on a treacherous mistress who holds them all her thrall. A better siren there could not be all the time controlled by the wicked Cousin Bette.Having reached the pinnacle of her revenge the tables begin to turn with further disgrace on Baron Hulot's part as he is founding guilty of defrauding the government in Algiers of two hundred thousand francs. His uncle and brother commit suicide and he is forced to hide in Paris (with Josepha's help). His brother's death, the Marshal, to whom Cousin Bette has secured a marriage - and hence an income - to means she begins to be revealed as a `sword of Damocles' over the Hulot family. Victorin Hulot, the son, commences to rebuild the family fortunes. Determined to restore the family fortune, Victorin sanctions the downfall of Madame Marneffe and her new husband, Crevel, through the enigmatic Madame Nourrison firstly through revealing her relationship with Crevel to Baron Montes whose rage knows no bounds, then lastly through a debilitating disease that claims the life of the Mayor and his lover. As Cousin Bette watches her evil mechinations fall apart with the death of her instrument of despair and then with Victorin restoring the family fortunes and the prodigal father's return she eventually dies, though not without some minor satisfaction at their mourning of her passing.This is probably Balzac's most accomplished novel, a story of jealousy and envy spiralling into bitterness and a perfidious desire. Cousin Bette invents multiple reasons to hate her Hulot family and unerring hits the week points of their personalities in an attempt to ruin them and thence be seen as their saviour. The insatiably wandering eye of Baron Hulot, the vainglorious ineptitude of Wencelas, coupled with their wives who seek to retain the family dignity bring this once proud family to their knees until the son realises that by simply revealing the truths behind the lies will break apart Cousin Bette's tenuous web of despair and set them on the road to happiness again. Halfway through there is a pointed aside as Balzac gives his definition of what creates a great artist - namely hard work and fires a single shot across this reviewer by aptly pointing out that those who cannot themselves achieve greatness in their art end up being a critic of those who can. Still...this is one Balzac novel that is well worth the time."}]}, "authors": ["Honor\u00e9 de Balzac"], "isbn": "0199553947", "longitude": 2.3514992, "periods": ["1800s"], "title": "Cousin Bette",
