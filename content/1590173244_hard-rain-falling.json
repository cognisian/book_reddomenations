Through Jack Levitt, the novel's protagonist, readers course through a part of America typically depicted in pulp novels and noir films, a world of hard drinking, corruption, violence, and prurience. Carpenter's writing is terse, blunt, and matter-of-fact. His characterization of Jack, Billy Lancing, Sally, and the other characters makes them three dimensional and elevates them beyond mere stereotype. The hardships of the characters and their response to the strictures of post-war America will eventually inspire the groundswell of protests and counterculture that characterized the late 1960s.Carpenter ostensibly arranges this novel into three major sections: Jack and Billy's hard scramble days as juvenile delinquents, their experiences in prison (both as children and as adults), and Jack's attempt to establish a family and domesticity with Sally, a San Francisco party girl with the sensibilities of a burgeoning femme fatale. Of these sections the final chapters involving Jack and Sally's doomed marriage is the most difficult to buy into, though it is interesting to see the changes in personality and outlook Jack makes by this point in the novel. By contrast, Hard Rain Falling is most successful in its rendering of the penal system and life behind bars, in which men's every movement is controlled and choreographed. Carpenter goes all in here; he critiques the penal system and decries the limits it places on individuals' personal freedoms. His thoughts on prison sexuality, in particular, are insightful and reasoned. Those chapters propel with force and brutal honesty.The most disconcerting aspect of the novel, however, is Carpenter's treatment of race and racism. Although the novel exhibits great historical fidelity in the way the white characters view race (the n-word is deployed often and without comment, not only by the novel's white characters but by the narrator as well) it is difficult to discern whether Carpenter himself evinces the blatant racism threaded throughout the novel or if he has merely aligned the narrator's language with the racist ethos of the environment these characters inhabit. Indeed, Billy, the novel's second protagonist, a light-skinned African American character, has obviously internalized the culture's racism; it, along with his internalized homophobia (I won't spoil) lead to his demise. Yet Carpenter's intention regarding the inclusion of Billy's powerful storyline is murky. Within both the dominate white culture neither Billy nor Jack can exist within and the profligate world of vice, gambling, and criminality where both he and Jack thrive, Billy is viewed as a racial and sexual \"other\". Billy's function in the novel inspires two important questions: Is Billy just another casualty in the long list of racial minorities and sexually fluid characters in Western literature authors use only as a sacrifice for the catharsis of a white man? Is Carpenter using Billy to take an early stand, although aborted, against racism and homophobia? Readers can't be sure. If Carpenter had taken us deeper into the complex relationship between Jack and Billy, the novel would be richer.A common complaint about Hard Rain Falling is that both Jack and Billy spend too much time philosophizing. I see nothing unusual about this. They may be criminals but criminals still ponder existence, the structure of society, and their place within it. Although Hard Rain Falling is not without it faults, it is a fine novel with strong, consistent writing that manages to blend several genres (prison literature, domestic realism, bildungsroman, pulp fiction) into one powerful book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A small gem of a book."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Hard. Realistic. Poetic. Sad. All at once."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The main character in this book is Jack Levitt.  He is 17 years old and tough.  He has run away from an orphanage.  The only thing he knows about life is that it is hard, and he has no capacity to change is life.  He has never been loved and through out this book he searches for something.  He is possibly searching for love but does not even recognize the feeling.  Throw away people often are locked into their way of life and do not know how to change. When life is hopeless for people they may fail to react to their problems---they go with the flow.  As Jack meets like people this is exactly the way they live  life.  Jack is a little different from most of the gang.  He wishes  for solitude, and quiet and wants to think.  Where ever he is he is trying to figure the whys.  He thinks in jail, and out of jail. Even in pool halls and whore houses Jack is thinking-----but alas it makes no difference, Jack  is still over whelmed with life.  Don Carpenter made the Jack Levitt character live.  I have never known a gang of thugs and I was fascinated with their life on the edge.  As I read about Jack, Denny and Billy the word hopeless kept popping into my thoughts. Jack was the toughest of the group.  In one of his depressed moods he began to think about how he would like to kill someone.  As he factored out his feelings he came to the conclusion that it was necessary to hate the person you planned to kill.  He dropped that plan because he could not think of anyone he hated.  Jack was not a whiner and he blamed only himself for his actions.  He took his punishment but that did not deter him from finding trouble.  The story and the writing are excellent. However, the book is depressing,sexual and raw."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A darn good book, if a little dark. The characters are amazing and will stay with you a long time.
