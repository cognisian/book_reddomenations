So it is with Thobela Mpayipheli, former freedom fighter, trying to settle back into the new South Africa. But at least he has his boy, an adored companion who is a link to a happier past. Then the boy is taken from Thobela, one of a staggering number of children murdered or abused in South Africa, and Thobela knows only despair...and a cold desire for revenge. Thus is born the vigilante killer known as 'Artemis'. The police respond by putting on the case a man who can't afford to fail. \r\n\r\nBenny Griessel is on the brink of losing everything -- his job, his family, his self-respect -- and this could be his last chance to drag his life back out of the gutter. And then Benny meets Christine, a young mother working as a prostitute in Cape Town. And something happens that is so frightening, the world can never be the same again, for Benny, for Christine, or for Thobela.\r\n\r\n\"A glimpse of the soul of the new South Africa in all its glory, and with all the gory details of its problems and corruption...I marvelled at the intricacy of the plotting, I smiled at Christine's cheeky ingenuity, I felt Thobela's pain and Benny's desperation, and I was stunned by a denouement of awesome power and accomplishment.\" The Guardian", "asin": "031601785X", "rank": "1208322", "city": "Cape Town", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51W59Cyiz1L.jpg", "country": "RSA", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
