I read it straight through for 2 days and couldn\u2019t put it down until I actually passed out sleep.  I took this exciting, inspirational and sometimes frustrating ride with Fire and Sylvia and was so attached to them at the end I became protective of them (from the other characters in the book \u2013 crazy, I know).  Theirs was a love so pure and sweet it will make you a little envious.  I\u2019ve never read Colin Channer before and didn\u2019t know what to expect.  After reading this I went back and found everything he had written that I could get my hands on and just began to devour them.  You will enjoy this once you get a handle on his writing style (which is very poetic and descriptive), I just flew through this book and couldn\u2019t wait to find out what would happen next.  I think anyone with a real romantic soul will enjoy this read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Amazing imagery and a beautiful story about love and choosing your true path through life."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Interesting read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Wicked!
