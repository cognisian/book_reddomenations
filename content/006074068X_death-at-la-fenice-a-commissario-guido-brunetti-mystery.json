I enjoyed it thoroughly, especially the atmospheric evocation of Venice through the eyes of a native.My only complaint was with the map in the Kindle edition. The author uses real places extensively, making following the action on the map part of the enjoyment. But the map provided had 2 issues: 1) It was spread across 2 pages, which made it hard to use, but that is perhaps forgivable to provide greater size. 2) This is the big one: the original map was apparently badly scanned, as if from a bound book, so there is a large vertical slice which is simply missing: the left and right sides meet, but the area between (several blocks at least across) is gone, making it impossible to follow many of the detective\u2019s movements.Since that problem is down to the Kindle production, not the author, I didn\u2019t take any stars off for it; if there was a separate Kindle rating, it\u2019d be 2 stars, because of the map and the numerous typos."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Ok..I've read better murder mysteries."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A well-crafted mystery: Who done-it ?And where else than in Venice ?

Brunetti, a native Venetian, sets out to unravel the mystery behind the high-profile murder. To do so, he he calls on his knowledge of Venice, its culture, and its dirty politics. Revenge, corruption, and even Italian cuisine play a role. The novel that started it all, Death at La Fenice is an entrancing mystery, rich in atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\u201cFew detective writers create so vivid, inclusive and convincing a narrative as Donna Leon, the expatriate American with the Venetian heart. . . .
