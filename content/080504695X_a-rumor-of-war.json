Caputo landed at Da Nang with the first ground combat unit deployed to Vietnam. Sixteen months later, having served on the line in one of modern history's ugliest wars, he returned home\u2015physically whole but emotionally wasted, his youthful idealism forever gone. \r\n\r\nA Rumor of War is more than one soldier's story. Upon its publication in 1977, it shattered America's indifference to the fate of the men sent to fight in the jungles of Vietnam. In the years since then, it has become not only a basic text on the Vietnam War but also a renowned classic in the literature of wars throughout history and, as Caputo explains, of \"the things men do in war and the things war does to men.\"\r\n\r\n\"A singular and marvelous work.\" New York Times\r\n\r\n\u201cCaputo's troubled, searching meditations on the love and hate of war, on fear, and the ambivalent discord warfare can create in the hearts of decent men, are among the most eloquent I have read in modern literature.\u201d William Styron, New York Review of Books", "asin": "080504695X", "rank": "210115", "city": "Ho Chi Minh City", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51R3tuXonJL.jpg", "country": "Hanoi", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
