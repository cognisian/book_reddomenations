Although it bears a few of the tropes of nineteenth-century fiction, this novella, written in 1832, was ahead of its time.  (In 1832, James Fennimore Cooper was probably the most popular author in America and Sir Walter Scott in Great Britain.)  COLONEL CHABERT is shot through with the realism that I understand Balzac is famous for.  But regardless of its place in literary history, I commend COLONEL CHABERT as a compulsively readable story of almost mythical depth and import.Colonel Chabert had been an officer in Napoleon's army.  At the battle of Eylau, in Prussia, Chabert had been at the center of the cavalry action that turned the battle in the favor of Napoleon.  However, he was grievously wounded and left for dead on the battlefield.  Napoleon was so upset he sent two surgeons to confirm that Chabert was dead, but, based on the reports on what had happened to Chabert and the massive gash on his skull, the surgeons didn't bother to check his pulse and reported back to Napoleon that he was quite dead.  He was thrown into a common grave.  A death certificate was issued, and in due course his widow liquidated his estate, taking over most of it for herself.  She then remarried, had two children, and began a campaign of social climbing.  But Chabert had not died.  In a gruesome scene, he emerged from under a pile of corpses, using a severed arm as a lever; he was taken in by peasants and over many months restored to health.  The present action of the novella kicks off when he returns to Paris, years later, to re-establish his identity, straighten matters out with his wife, and reclaim as much of his fortune as possible.  He ends up employing a lawyer who also serves as his wife's lawyer.  (Apparently there was no concept of \"conflict of interest\" among the legal profession of Restoration France.)  His wife publicly denounces him as an imposter and privately uses her womanly wiles to shunt him aside.  All the time, Chabert maintains an obdurate dignity and honor.  But honor is a Napoleonic concept, now outmoded.Balzac packs a lot into the relatively slim COLONEL CHABERT -- 101  pages in this splendid translation by Carol Cosman, as published by New Directions.  Two things stood out for me.  First, the physical squalor that so many citizens of Paris lived in.  Second, the moral squalor of the professionals and upper class.  Near the end of the novella, the attorney who had represented both Chabert and his wife reflects:  \"Do you know * * * that in our society there are three men, the priest, the doctor, and the lawyer, who cannot appreciate the world?  They wear black robes perhaps because they are in mourning for all virtue and hope.  The unhappiest of the three is the lawyer.  When a man seeks out the priest, he is moved by repentance, by remorse, by passionate beliefs that elevate him and comfort the soul of the mediator.  The priest brings a little joy; he purifies, he heals, he reconciles.  But when he comes to us, the lawyers, we see the same ill feelings repeated again and again, never corrected.  Our offices are gutters that cannot be cleansed.\"  COLONEL CHABERT has some of the tragic, mythical elements of Aeschylus and Sophocles.An indication of the enduring power of COLONEL CHABERT is its appearance in two recent, major novels -- \"Austerlitz\" by W. G. Sebald and \"The Infatuations\" by Javier Mar\u00edas.  Indeed, it was reading those two novels that prompted me to get COLONEL CHABERT.  In Sebald's great novel, the title character brings up Balzac's novella in his next-to-last conversation with the narrator and relates how reading Balzac's novella is what \"reinforced [his] suspicion * * * that the border between life and death is less impermeable than we commonly think.\"  The novella figures much more prominently in \"The Infatuations\", as it is at the center of the amoral philosophical rationalizations of the murderer D\u00edaz-Varela.  Among other lessons he cites Balzac for is that \"the dead must stay where they are and nothing can be corrected.\""}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Balzac is the best, and this is a great story, done economically."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "great book!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I read this after viewing the film.
