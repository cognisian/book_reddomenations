However, I must say I'm a bit taken aback by those who were put off by the gore. Did you not read what it was about before you picked it up? It's about serial killers... There's bound to be some gore. Hello? Anyway, there are some OCR issues with the Kindle version so the wrong words are used sometimes--that's not the author's fault. The writing here was solid and juicy, and I lapped it right up. One reviewer said it was purple, but I disagree. Just because there are words used that you don't know does not make it purple. One thing that astounded me was how each character had his own voice. I knew whose POV it was immediately. Well done, Poppy Z. Brite. I will be diving into the rest of her work soon."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I finally picked up this book after remembering what a big splash the author made back in the mid-90s. I have to say that the splash was well deserved. If you know anything about the author\u2019s books, you know that I mean that in the ways you\u2019re probably thinking. But I also mean it in others.The quality of the writing here is very strong. The characters are all generally drawn quite well, with the exception ofAndrew\u2019s voice is compelling, and as he drives a majority of the events, having him take the lead in the first chapter is an excellent choice. And, despite the fact that he is a serial killer who revels in all the usual cruelty and unique bloodiness his obsession entails, he is a compelling character whenever his scenes queue up. A bad guy readers love to hate and love at the same time.It is a particular testament to the author\u2019s skill to note that the method by which Andrew escapes from prison is drawn quite believably in the novel\u2026even skeptical readers will agree to suspend their disbelief.Jay is a budding killer who has the discipline to avoid fouling the city where he lives with his own kills\u2026until Tran, a particularly beautiful Vietnamese hustler throws his considerable charms at Jay\u2019s feet.Tran\u2019s sections are very well drawn, and allow readers to walk in yet a third lifestyle and mindset that is very different than the first two offered up in this book.Lucas is the one that is the least compelling. Perhaps this is because his illness keeps him quiet in terms of activity, or perhaps it\u2019s because he has the most common, almost suburban, existence of all the characters. Still, his portrait, when added to the other three, rounds out this work and creates a richness that otherwise would be lacking.The four are pulled ever more tightly together. The two killers begin to work together, and there is that bloody finale that had so many people squawking when the work came out. (The author was rejected by the publisher of all his previous books because of the gruesome climactic orgy.) Which certainly is shocking but really isn\u2019t any more horrible or ugly to read than many of the sections the killer recalls and enacts in preceding scenes. Which leads you to wonder why this was rejected at all.If you\u2019re a gory fiction fan, this one is for you!If you enjoy stories that capture the mind of killers, you should check out\u00a0Beloved: A Sensual Noir Thriller"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This was a great book. Superb writing about a very disturbing subject. I have never read a book like this."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I know taste in books is personal, but this book has no redeeming values to me. After reading it, I feel a bit ashamed of myself! I feel l participated in something immoral. I enjoy a dark or gory read sometimes, but this..... I understand that it is fantasy, but the amount and detail of torture was over the top. Morality aside, many of the plot twists were too convenient and the almost supernatural abilities the serial killer used to escape from jail were laughable. I also can't decide if the author hates gay men or just has an obsessive fascination with them. Not every gay man has HIV/AIDS! I normally donate my books after I read them, but I will be using this to line bird cages."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Really gross and unpleasant"}]}, "authors": ["Poppy Z.

After feigning his own death to escape from prison, Compton makes his way to the United States with the sole ambition of bringing his \u201cart\u201d to new heights. Tortured by his own perverse desires, and drawn to possess and destroy young boys, Compton inadvertently joins forces with Jay Byrne, a dissolute playboy who has pushed his \u201cart\u201d to limits even Compton hadn\u2019t previously imagined. Together, Compton and Byrne set their sights on an exquisite young Vietnamese-American runaway, Tran, whom they deem to be the perfect victim. \r\n\r\nSwiftly moving from the grimy streets of London\u2019s Piccadilly Circus to the decadence of the New Orleans French Quarter, Poppy Z.
