A breathtaking period of social change has seen foreign investment bringing capitalism flooding into its nominally communist society, booming cities swallowing up smaller villages, and the lure of modern living tugging at the traditional networks of family and community. \r\n\r\nYet beneath these sweeping developments lurks an authoritarian political system that complicates the nation\u2019s apparent renaissance. In this engaging work, experienced journalist Bill Hayton looks at the costs of change in Vietnam and questions whether this rising Asian power is really heading toward capitalism and democracy.\r\n\r\nBased on vivid eyewitness accounts and pertinent case studies, Hayton\u2019s book addresses a broad variety of issues in today\u2019s Vietnam, including important shifts in international relations, the growth of civil society, economic developments and challenges, and the nation\u2019s nascent democracy movement as well as its notorious internal security. His analysis of Vietnam\u2019s \u201cpolice state,\u201d and its systematic mechanisms of social control, coercion, and surveillance, is fresh and particularly imperative when viewed alongside his portraits of urban and street life, cultural legacies, religion, the media, and the arts. \r\n\r\nWith a firm sense of historical and cultural context, Hayton examines how these issues have emerged and where they will lead Vietnam in the next stage of its development.\r\n", "asin": "030017814X", "rank": "399025", "city": "Ho Chi Minh City", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51rSxxC41wL.jpg", "country": "Hanoi", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
