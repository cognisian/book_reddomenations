It was grueling to get through at some points, though. (Thanks to the magic of Goodreads, I can confirm it took me nearly two months to finish it.)Station Eleven would work better as a movie, with characters trimmed out. I ended up caring for any of them, though I eventually fell into the world.

Nice the way the author introduces the characters one at a time and back and forth through time."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This is another entry into one of my pet genres, which I affectionately call \"books about books.\"  This one is nominally sci-fi as it is set in a post-apocalyptic world where high-tech civilization has collapsed and in the ensuing, increasingly wild mid-west, a troupe of actors and musicians travel from town to town, performing Shakespeare and symphonies.  King Lear figures prominently in the story.  A child actor from the opening King Lear performance serves as the main protagonist; the child from the actor playing King Lear in the opening performance serves as the main antagonist.  There are several interesting connections between the pre- and post-apocalyptic worlds that serve to entertain.  This won an award when it was published and was very well-received.  I found it on the light side, though fairly well-written.  It is not terribly challenging in style, vocabulary or plot but does gently pull you into the story arc in a surprisingly effective way.  Shakespeare resonates through this book, which I thoroughly enjoyed."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I liked the non-linear story line, and how author wove the threads together.
