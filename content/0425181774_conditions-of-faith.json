About one-third of the way through, I felt like throwing the book across the room except for being too sensible not to damage my walls. Then I stuck with it till the half way mark and gave up.As a counsellor who has worked with people for nearly two decades, I have heard outlandish stories from clients but there are always root causes for such outlandish behaviours - their parents' behaviours, their traumatic experiences, their early life experiences, etc. The portrait painted of Emily (what I have read of it),  just begs plausibility. This woman, who is supposed to be intelligent (did history and got a first at Cambridge) marries a Frenchman she hardly knew, then sleeps with a priest in a spontaneous tryst, and goes off (still very freshly married) to Tunisia with a friend of the husband, with the husband's blessing, for a holiday.I have a son who went to Cambridge - I know the demands required to gain that sort of academic achievements - I don't believe people that impulsive and unstable would get Firsts at Cambridge.A good novel has to be, first and foremost, plausible. This book totally fails on that score, based on half the book I read. I refuse to waste my time on the rest. Don't buy it. It will annoy the heck out of you - hence the average review is so low - that should tell you something!"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Very disappointing read. My first Alex Miller novel and I am hesitant about reading anymore! Long winded in sections and I found Emily the main character painfully annoying. Selfish and arrogant a spoilt snob! Trying to make parallels with the giving up her career and unwanted child with the story line of some historical myth was quite frankly bloody stupid. I can't believe I finished it, I guess I was living in hope that this woman would grow up and live up to her responsibilities. Not so lucky!"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Emily Stanton had the world at her feet - which is quite extraordinary for a young woman living in 1920's Australia. She has the opportunity to study at Cambridge, but turns this enlightened option down to marry Georges; a Scottsman who is competing in the Sydney bridge competition. Emily is enticed by George's life in Paris and is also eager to overcome the pain of indecisions which have been troubling her since finishing school. So, she marries him and moves to Paris.But Emily's life takes a sudden dip when they arrive back in Paris; she finds her husband totally engrossed in his work and she feels completely isolated. She becomes close with one of George's friends, Antoine but is still uneasy about her new life. Emily finds herself travelling around the world to Tunsia where she may just find her purpose....This is an excruciating book to read. The book's downfall can be marked when Emily and Georges go to meet his mother in Chartres; while exploring the cathedral there, Emily meets a priest... and in the whopping 15 minutes since they lay eyes on one another, she is breaking her wedding vowels and having her very first affair. The reason behind this sudden surge of lust is not explained in the writing, and while the encounter has huge repercussion's for Emily, the reader is left feeling that the heat of passion was merely a catalyst for the rest of the book; an unexplained catalyst which is very spontaneous, unbeliveable and quite frankly, stupid.Honestly, dont read this book. Just, dont. There is hardly any internal monologue and the endless descriptions of everything but the characters thoughts and feelings leave them as one-dimensional, soulless and uninteresting. This lack of attention makes the reader very frustrated; especially when the character's have long-winded speeches which dont sound at all natural, more like lectures, and pop up out of nowehere, amidst pages and pages of boring and irritating descriptions of the settings.The character of Emily is built up but falls extremely short in reality; while at school she apparently topped the class in History (atleast that's what Miller repeats over and over and over again. Its really quite hilarious after a while because anyone reading this novel can see Emily is an absolute dim-wit.I really had to trudge through this novel, and try not to lose grip by hurling the book across the room and stomping on it. How this was shortlisted for any prize anywhere in the world is beyond me... its utterly horrid."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I really wanted to like this book, but the more I've reflected on it the more I was disturbed by it - in a bad way.  At a superficial level, the writing is clear and sophisticated and the story tries to be a real portrait of modern thought developing in the early 20th century.  But I wonder how much of that is just taking today's socially liberal thinking and misapplying it to that period of time.I also found the author's parallels between the main character (Emily) and Perpetua to be disappointing.  From the middle of the book I started hoping the book would not end as predictably as it did.  I also found the Emily/Perpetua storyline to be a slam on motherhood.  Miller tries to couch this in respect, and explain how \"everyone's different and finds their passions in different things\" but I felt there was not enough effort expended by Emily (and ESPECIALLY by her friend Olive) to justify her actions.  As a mother myself I felt sorry for the characters, when Miller seems to be trying to glorify their choices.So this is a thought provoking book, which is good, but I feel that the characters and the storyline did not adequately support the message Miller tries to convey.  That, combined with the utterly predictable plot, makes me give it only 2 stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "My sister recommended me this book, and I was looking forward to read something that at least was partly set in my native Australia. And the thought of reading a recently published work that would be reminiscent of My Brilliant Career was very inviting. This is a novel of choices, and the price we pay for making certain choices in our lives. And I think the novel does show that in the 1920's choices for women and how well they could control their lives were quite limited.A condition of Faith, however, was a big disappointment and unfortunately a rather dull and lack-luster read. I had a real problem with Miller's style - his short, sharp sentences didn't allow the narrative to really flow. Lots of time is given to description of what the characters are doing in their domestic lives, but there is little if any description of their internal workings - their psyches or their motivations. There is no doubt that Miller has done a mountain of research to really recreate the period in Melbourne, Paris and North Africa, but I think he just gets too bogged down in period description without letting the characters' motivations tell the story.  I also didn't buy the Emily's central motivation: would a well educated, upper middle class Australian girl like Emily from the 1920's impetuously jump into a sudden marriage with a Frenchman? And would she have done what she did with the Bishop in the Crypt in Chartres?  I found this unconvincing; therefore, I found the rest of the story equally implausible.As everything in the novel is filtered through Emily's eyes, we really get to know little about the other characters and what motivates them - we know that Georges is driven by obtaining the tender to build the Sydney Harbour Bridge, but we never really get to know him and how he deeply feels about Emily - he comes across as stock stereotypical Frenchman, committed to Emily as long as she plays dutiful wife and mother.To be fair there are some good things about Conditions of Faith. I quite liked the scenes in Tunisia - Miller really managed to capture the intense heat and atmosphere of that part of the world. He brings this part of the world vividly to life, particularly with the sub-plots involving Arab nationalism and the history of Carthage, yet these subplots kind of fall flat and never really go anywhere. And his descriptions of Emily painfully studying in the Library in Paris are indeed riveting and heart breaking; you really get a sense of her inner conflict and struggles. It was also nice to have a history lesson on the development of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.Generally though, Conditions of Faith is a pretty dull and flat read. If you want to read some Australian literature that is really representative of the Australian psyche, read some Martin Boyd, particularly the novel A Difficult Young Man.Michael"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Alex Miller provides us with a novel that is easy to follow and hard to put down. Though it is enjoyable and touching, it lacks a depth of the parallel and lacks layers. The story is exactly what you read, there are no double meanings, no possible alternatives to the predicable unresolved situations. The novel is set in the 1920's, yet the social attitudes in the book represent that of the modern era. As does the main character, Emily, who in separating herself from her family in order to follow her dreams, and to defy her husbands wishes presents us with a story we can relate to because we most probably are experienceing or observing situations and problems  around us in the year 2003 similar to what emily is experiencing. Yet the story is quite unbelievable given the time in which the novel is set and the cultures that surround it. Such as Emily not attending church with the Elder family whilst in Charters; this just would not have been acceptable in 1920 Paris, but is quite acceptable now for people to be non-religious. We come to know and like each of the characters, yet they too lack a depth of reality. They appear two dimentional and we see only of them what Emily sees them to be. We see Georges as almost a mechanical, unemotional figure who cares only for his bridge. We become infuriated with him being so content with his life, he ignores Emily's lack of contentment and cold behaviours, and is content suffering these as long as he can keep her, and this contentment of his makes Emily feel more trapped into a life she doesnt want to live and feels she cannot; and we then become infuriated by Georges contentment we think: why is this man such a fool? We see only his content and his dream. There is not much else to his character. Though we see he loves Emily, we dont get an insight or depth into this love and Georges emotions and feelings. We dont even get a deep insight into Georges and Emily's relationship, it lacks a realistic connection between the 2 characters and their marriage almost does not operate but is just apart of the context. They make love, but this lacks just as much emotion and detail as the sweet things emily says to georges to reassure him she is happy; which of course is not true.  All in all this is a long  but light story in which we can clearly derive the value of being true to ourselves and following our dreams. We can relate to the main character being a woman searching for herself in the world and searching for her roles in life. The situation the charcter finds herself in is realistic, even if the setting of the novel and its characters lack reality; because it inevitably is about choices and how choices can rule our lives, what consequences we have to suffer as a result of our choices and how we can survive with these sufferings and be faithful to ourselves. And we realsie that it is important that people in our lives have faith in us for us to be able to acheive."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "With the exception of the first couple of pages that describe perfectly an Australian beach on a hot day (and which made me think that I would enjoy the book), this is a very ordinary novel.  I lost interest completely in the characters, who I thought to be cardboard, and found the incident in Chartres with the priest very silly.  Perhaps the problem I had was that I read this straight after reading Atonement.  Conditions of Faith pales in comparison."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "P>Alex Miller's latest novel, like his best-known book, \"Ancestor Game,\" centers on international travels and emigrations whose starting point is his home country of Australia. His inspiration to write \"Conditions of Faith\" came from his mother's journal, which he found after her death. From entries his mother made about her experiences as a young woman living in Paris during the 1920s, his novel's restless heroine was born.Emily Stanton is a bright 25-year-old Australian with eager dreams of making a brave, original life for herself. In the tradition of George Eliot's Middlemarch and Henry James's Portrait of a Lady, her story turns on the irony that a woman's very determination to transcend the world's conventional restrictions can blind her to the realities hidden behind her bravest choices. As Emily tries to make herself a character in a life story that will be uniquely true to her desires, she gets tangled in the narratives of other persons.It's 1923, and Emily meets Georges, a promising architect ten years her senior who has come to Australia from Paris to brainstorm designs for the proposed Sydney Harbor Bridge, which will be the longest in the world. Although Emily might have embarked on a career of her own - she earned a First in history at Cambridge -she rejects that possibility to marry Georges.This hardly sounds like an iconoclastic role choice for a woman desiring freedom. But Emily makes her decision on impulse, and very much against her father's expectation that she'll pursue a brilliant scholarly career. To her, rebelling against her father is a radical gesture that throws off a great burden. She won't surrender to family demands; she'll find her own purpose in life. And she'll do it in Paris!Emily soon discovers family demands everywhere. Georges takes her to Chartres, where she meets his mother. This woman has always dominated her son's life, and she makes sure Emily knows that his ancestors' names appear in the 12th-century records of the great cathedral. Emily, vexed at her mother-in-law's arrogance and at her husband's blindness to her misery, has a fling at Chartres that complicates the rest of her life. The story is full of unexpected turns that take Emily all the way to Tunisia and the archaeological dig at Carthage, where history finally becomes more than an academic subject and takes on vital meaning for her.Throughout the novel we meet intriguing characters, including Emily's powerful yet vulnerable father, and her mother, a woman of moral weight and wit who sees clearly and won't mince words. Georges' friend Antoine becomes Emily's confidant in Paris, and he's a terrific talker. So are others who play major supporting roles in the book, like the Paris doctor Leon, the Arab archaeologist Hakim, and the scholar Olive Kallam.This strength is also a weakness in the narrative. You'd think a heroine in a novel full of conversation, who is described as assertive and intelligent, would speak up. But all the other characters talk more than she, and more interestingly.Still, regardless of who's speaking at a given moment, the writing is provocative and absorbing on subjects ranging from Arab politics to the politics of motherhood, from freedom of choice to purpose in life.For example: Is finding no purpose in life more frightening than finding a purpose that wholly takes it over? Can ambition substitute for purpose? Georges' ambition to build a fabulous bridge doesn't lead him to ask about what purpose it might serve - - a question that \"'involves a kind of moral uncertainty \ufffd for which Georges possesses no curiosity.'\"But is purpose really different from ambition, or desire? Perhaps \"'all passions are the same passion'\" in that \"'our passions always require from us a betrayal of our former state.'\"This kind of talk makes you glad \"Conditions of Faith\" can't be described as a page-turner. You want to put this book down and think about it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "....Conditions of Faith was written and published in 2000, but itsprose is that of a classic novel of the Victorian age.  The writingstyle is flawless and flows along quite effortlessly.  After so manyhackneyed plots and bad writing styles that continually rotate theBest Sellers racks in department and grocery stores across thecountry, it is refreshing to read such an original, intelligent, andwell-written story as Conditions of Faith.  The plot is veryinteresting and was invented when Miller, a well-loved Australianauthor and winner of the Commonwealth Writers Prize and Australia'smost prestigious literary prize, The Miles Franklin Award, received ajournal his mother left him when she died, which contained only a fewsparse entries.  Another carefully crafted aspect of this novel is thevivid descriptions of both Paris and Tunisia, which make the readerfeel as if she or he were really seeing these places and want toexperience life in France and Africa for him or herself.  Conditionsof Faith is Miller's fifth book, but only the first to be publishedin the United States.  Hopefully more of his work will be publishedhere, because this is a novel that should be treasured by all writersand readers as an example of true literary achievement and skill."}]}, "authors":
