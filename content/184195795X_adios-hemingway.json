Conde is a well established figure in the Padura canon with four previous outings, but here he appears as an ex cop and would be writer.  What better challenge than to be asked by his former police colleague to solve the mystery of a corpse unearthed at the Hemingway Museum at the great man's Cuban home.  The murder dates to the late 50s when an aging Hemingway was struggling with his health, his legacy and his relationships.  Padura / Conde have their own love / hate relationship with Papa and the investigation plays out into a deeply researched and heartfelt reflection on the flawed literary icon.  I know this is a book I will return to in time, to soak up the atmosphere and emotion that necessarily fall victim in a first read of what is also a tense and well paced thriller."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This was a very good read, especially as I was just in Cuba and went to Hemingway\"s home.

It's description of the house is extremely accurate and vivid. Even if you are not familiar with Cuba, this is a very enjoyable and unique mystery novel focused on a famous American novelist.
