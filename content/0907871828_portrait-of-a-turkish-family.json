I finished it in less than 2 full days.  No need to repeat others' descriptions, but I'd like to address a 2011 review (Ord?) who says he didn't understand why the author's mother said he had become distant a long time ago. \"He describes his mother's hardness when dealing with impossible loss. He comes across as a sensitive enough child to understand that his mother's loss was tremendous and perhaps most sad. But he doesn't describe how exactly he became distant from his family later on.\"I can't find it, but I think it was from the sense of abandonment when the mother left him and his brother in the first place when they were very young.Throughout, there are references to the mother's emotional descent (the tragedies she/they suffered were terrible) only to be pulled back from the brink of insanity.She married at 13 and was plunged into a life of extreme hardships in her early 20s. I was struck by her resilience and everything she, accustomed to a life of luxury, did to survive and raise 3 children to the best of her ability.The book covers two world wars. Now (December 2016) that our world is seeing radical Islamic led/inspired attacks and a Russian ambassador assassinated in Ankara, it seemed the right time to pick up this book and hope that the other international occurrences are not going to lead history to repeat itself. I pray for peace on earth."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "interesting, old appeared 50 years ago.."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Well written, historically valuable, and very sad.

It's a middle class Turkish family in the early 1900s. They squabble with relatives and have a comfortable life selling carpets.

The story is told from the point of view of a young man describing the environment and circumstances of coming of age in Turkey.  For me it was a slow read and I didn't rate it very high as I didn't think it was representative of the lifestyle experienced by the ordinary Turk.  Orga came from a well to do family by any standard.His motivation for writing this story was reciprocal to my desire to read it.
