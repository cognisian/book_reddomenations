Written 75+ years ago but the book remains highly relevant, especially when read against the backdrop of today's Hollywood sex scandals that are splattered all over the media these days.The author was a Hollywood insider and based his central character on a composite of real life entertainment figures he knew in the business. By reading the book one soon learns that little if nothing has changed in the intervening period (if there's been any doubt).The author's style is freewheeling, a little repetitive, and the Great American Novel it ain't, but I do highly recommend it. \"What Makes Sammy Run\" is one of the best books I've read this year and I've read a bunch."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Wonderful book that I personally highly recommend reading to people of all ages."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I bought this book on a recommendation.

He is one of the symp-toms of our times\u2014from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run?\r\n\r\nThis is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York\u2019s East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic\u2014his congenital incapacity for friendship.\r\n\r\nAn older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening.\r\n\r\nWhen a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick\u2019s real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.", "asin": "0679734228", "rank": "89383", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5192kRqG2YL.jpg", "country": "Los Angeles", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
