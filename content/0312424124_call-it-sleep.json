With clear genetic links to the work of James Joyce and the German-Austrian Joseph Roth, and the he story is told from the perspective of a young boy, newly immigrated to the US in a complex family living in several cultural contexts. The Jewish novel may have perished with Portnoy's complaint, but novels like Call It Sleep evoke in sepia tones an era that holds immense nostalgia, respect and astonishment for new generations of readers whether they be Jewish or not.
