It is set in Corsica, and tells the story of the della Rebbia family, whose father has been murdered in an ambush, believed by his daughter to have been perpetrated by the town's mayor, Lawyer Barricini. \r\n\r\nShe implores her brother, Lieutenant Orso della Rebbia, to avenge their father's death, but Orso does not share her passionate ancestral pride. His heart is torn between personal vendetta and a propensity to abide by the law.\r\n\r\nFernanda Eberstadt calls it \"a shrewd, dispassionate portrait of nineteenth-century Corsica\"\r\n\r\nProsper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e (1803-1870) was an author by hobby, not necessity, being the son of two talented and highly successful artists.
