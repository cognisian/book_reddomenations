So I purchased this hoping I would like it as well. While I did still really like the high quality writing style and technique of the author, I was very disappointed by the plot and characters in this book. They were not at all what I wanted to be reading about. (No spoilers!) Some of the characters I outright hated and the remainder I merely disliked. It may just be a personal preference, but I do want there to be at least one sympathetic character in a novel. The storyline I found very boring. Nothing really happened that was particularly intriguing or exciting. Maybe I didn't care what happened to these characters, or maybe I just didn't care about these events? I don't know, but either way, I didn't care."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I have always been fascinated by tapestries, and I loved The Girl with a Pearl Earring, so I was very excited to read this book.  However, the wonderful story is spoiled by the coarse writing style and some very unpleasant characters.Now, I have nothing against unpleasant characters.  There have to be a few now and then.  But these characters are so very unpleasant, and so crudely portrayed. The character Nicholas is particularly odious, and his frequent unicorn metaphors become tedious very quickly.The novel is rich in historical detail, and the plot is cleverly intertwined with the weaving of the tapestries.  The story could have been quite wonderful if it had been written in a more appealing style."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "k"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Tracy Chevalier writes really good books that take you right into the period she is describing.

Little is known about them except that they were woven toward the end of the fifteenth century and bear the coat of arms of a wealthy family from Lyons.\r\n\r\nTracy Chevalier takes readers back to the tapestries\u2019 creation, giving life to the men who designed and made them, as well as the wives, daughters, and servants who exercised subtle (and not so subtle) influences over their men. Like the many different strands of wool and silk that were woven together into one cloth, the lives and fates of these people entwine in complex patterns, crisscrossing as they seek desires sensual and spiritual, temporal and eternal.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary story exquisitely told, Tracy Chevalier\u2019s The Lady and the Unicorn weaves history and fiction into a beautiful, timeless, and intriguing literary tapestry that rivals in grace and grandeur the masterpiece that inspired it.", "asin": "B00BG7IH4W", "rank": 0, "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514BrDp5bBL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
