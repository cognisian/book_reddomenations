I thought it started out impressively as a skillfully crafted blend of Black folklore and magical realism that effectively articulated - often through infusion of patois - aspects of Jamaican history, culture and the insidious, lingering effects of colonialism. In most respects, those aspects of the narrative pervaded to the conclusion.Unfortunately, once the multiple textures converged to fully illuminate the central story line the book lost distinctiveness, mirroring a number of other books with a core focus of perfidious classism and the seemingly inevitable victimization of a marginalized underclass."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I thought the N.Y.

This is a lyrical, sensuous novel.  Kei Miller colours outside the lines, refusing to acknowledge a boundary between poetry and prose.  The scenes pouring out of the novelist\u2019s pen are so vivid, a reader can see and smell and hear and touch and feel every event, every emotion.I had to stop to collect myself when the sanctity of a little boy\u2019s dreadlocks was violated.  Take a break to clear my mind from the brutal images of the autoclaps.  All while chuckling at the audacity of the narrator who berates the reader for ascribing labels such as \u201cmagical realism\u201d to the unfolding events.I don't know if I will ever be able to write a proper review of this novel.

Kei is a weaver of tales in a way that's grounded in reality. As a non Jamaican I saw how he was able to connect class race and folklore with the backdrop of a real place called augustown.

It's a sad and necessary story that's told well."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I absolutely loved reading this book to the point where I was sad that it ended.
