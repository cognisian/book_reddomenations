Among the elements that stand out for me are Hillhouse\u2019s use of the local speech flavor and the domestic scenes at Mama\u2019s house, particularly the family\u2019s preparation for the CARICOM Day picnic. Both feel very authentic, very Caribbean. I especially love the novel\u2019s ending, and, without spoiling it, the way Hillhouse juxtaposes a festive cultural event with a great tragedy. The tragedy itself is wonderfully evoked\u2014not melodramatic but with sufficient pathos. It reminds me of the ending of Things Fall Apart and many other great tragic endings. After the opening scene the pace becomes a little slow for me, for a spell, but not enough to discourage me from continuing. All in all, Oh Gad! did to me what all great novels do to me: It left me thinking, when the story ended, \u201cShucks; I'm going to miss these people (the characters).\u201d"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I loved learning about Antigua and its history as the back drop to the story of complicated relationships and reconnecting to family.

Well written and I recommend it."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I laughed and cried my way through reading Oh Gad! My dad is Antiguan, and I grew up spending summers with my family there.  There was so much that resonated with me - the landscape, the family dramas, the hot kitchen, the feeling of outsiderness, the stoicism. I love that it's a story set in the contemporary Caribbean and addresses Nikki's struggles fitting into a family structure alongside larger social issues of conservation, economic development, etc. I was so happy to be introduced to Joanne Hillhouse's work, and I'm looking forward to reading more soon."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "This book was a suggested read.
