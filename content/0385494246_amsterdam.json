Structurally, I mean.\u2019 \u201cit does hang together well, and in conclusion those two points connect as the fourth line, solving the equation.  however, mathematical puzzles and structural integrity are different animals.  the conclusion is constructed of flimsy material, translated in literary language, what starts out as serious fiction ends with an action so subtle in execution as to be silliness.  one can spend endless hours attempting to make sense of it, perhaps in a moral context, perhaps as karma or even as divine comedy, or one can accept it as a fitting ending without asking why and accepting that in the realm of fiction this is the turn mcewan wanted to apply and leave it at that."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Starts interestingly, soars high during the first and second act and the finale is a letdown. Agree with other critics that the language is great, and makes me want to re-read several lines, and I might re-visit some passages - the ones that describe human nature, and aligns it to nature in general, there are several quote-worthy passages here.However, the ending, though is a neat twist, seems out of character. It seems forced.One might justify it as dark comedy or something similar, but still, there is a lack of a strong buildup towards this finale - much like Clive's composition."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't get into it.
