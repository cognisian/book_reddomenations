What we weren't prepared for were the images of people stranded on their own rooftops.  Like so many others, I wondered aloud, \"Why didn't those fools evacuate?\" After reading this book, I understand and am more than embarrassed by my naive opinions. Mr Piazza weaves a bittersweet story about every day people living their lives in the exotic climate of New Orleans. Katrina roared ashore and took so much from so many yet could not destroy the binds that keep families together. With determined spirits, they endured and returned to rebuild not only their city, but also their lives."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Loved this story of two families in the aftermath of Katrina.

Piazza has made all of what is at the heart of NO today come alive and real for me. Beyond that this book has so many levels of meaning--family dynamics and the importance of them in our lives; career and personal choices and the paths they cause us to walk; the internal strength a person can have; and how the best friends we have may be the strangers who live near us."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great book!

His sister, Lucy, is a soulful mess, and SJ has been trying to keep her son, Wesley, out of trouble. Across town, Craig Donaldson, a Midwestern transplant and the editor of the city's alternative paper, faces deepening cracks in his own family. New Orleans' music and culture have been Craig's passion, but his wife, Alice, has never felt comfortable in the city. The arrival of their two children has inflamed their arguments about the wisdom of raising a family there.\r\n\r\nWhen the news comes of a gathering hurricane\u2014named Katrina\u2014the two families make their own very different plans to weather the storm. The Donaldsons join the long evacuation convoy north, across Lake Pontchartrain and out of the city. SJ boards up his windows and brings Lucy to his house, where they wait it out together, while Wesley stays with a friend in another part of town.\r\n\r\nBut the long night of wind and rain is only the beginning\u2014and when the levees give way and the flood waters come, the fate of each family changes forever. The Williamses are scattered\u2014first to the Convention Center and the sweltering Superdome, and then far beyond city and state lines, where they struggle to reconnect with one another. The Donaldsons, stranded and anxious themselves, find shelter first in Mississippi, then in Chicago, as Craig faces an impossible choice between the city he loves and the family he had hoped to raise there.\r\n\r\nRanging from the lush neighborhoods of New Orleans to Texas, Missouri, Chicago, and beyond, City of Refuge is a modern masterpiece\u2014a panoramic novel of family and community, trial and resilience, told with passion, wisdom, and a deep understanding of American life in our time.\r\n\r\n\"City of Refuge is an old-fashioned, realistic novel of New Orleans, with all the sensuousness, all the flash-point tumult, the easy-yet-hard-won virtue of the city, as well all the forthrightness, the deftness and affirming intensity of the form. People ask me when will Katrina begin to inform our art, when will imagination become essential to tell what the raw facts can't. Well, here's an answer: now. City of Refuge speaks eloquently into that silence.\" Richard Ford", "asin": "0061673617", "rank": "661784", "city": "New Orleans", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NE67Li1-L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
