Sebald is brilliant at evoking the elusive nature of the past, as his protagonist Austerlitz, a former refugee from Nazi Germany, tries to rediscover his origins.  In places, the novel is Proustian (including one increasingly horrific, eleven-page sentence describing the functioning of the concentration camp where his mother would have been interned, which is also a clever parody of Proust), but in constantly distancing the reader from Austerlitz's narrative, and with his uncertainties and speculations demonstrating what cannot be recaptured, this, his last novel, is actually more of a refutation of Proust.  Sebald's use of blurry, usually inartistic photographs, only approximately linked to the narrative, also makes the imaginative reconstruction of Austerlitz's past seem more real, while at the same time increasing the reader's distance from it.  One is left with a life history which seems both real and yet ultimately incomprehensible, as are the actual events of the Nazi era itself.  Despite its somewhat experimental nature, a compelling read!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A compelling, innovative major Holocaust novel about trauma and repressed memory experienced by a survivor of the kindertransport.

It is also the name of the title character of W.G. Sebald\u2019s strangely absorbing illustrated novel telling how you can take the boy out of the Holocaust but you can\u2019t take the Holocaust out of the boy.  One day in 1967, the undescribed, unnamed narrator encounters a strangely dressed fellow taking pictures in the Antwerp train station and strikes up a conversation.  Austerlitz turns out to be a savant of rail transport, an inveterate traveler who knows all there is to know about the train stations of Europe, and a lot else besides.  The novel proceeds episodically from station to station as the years pass and the narrator and Austerlitz meet, converse and say farewell.  It turns out that there is a point to this odd travelogue, and it concerns Austerlitz\u2019s primal westward train journey across Europe as a young boy on the \u201ckindertransport.\u201d  This was the desperate 1938-39 effort of Jewish families to save their children from the Nazis, since they couldn\u2019t save themselves.  The action of the later part of the novel concerns Austerlitz\u2019s quest to discover his origins.  What makes \u201cAusterlitz\u201d unforgettable is Sebald\u2019s Proustian style, composed of sinuous sentences that proceed gracefully for pages and pages before ending just at the right place.  The elegaic mood of these backward-looking sentences draws the reader into the tragedy of Austerlitz\u2019s life and its eventual triumph."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Always meaning to read this and finally got it done"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Why the first page is 13?!?!?!?\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43"}]}, "authors": ["W.G.

G. Sebald\u2019s celebrated masterpiece includes a new Introduction by acclaimed critic James Wood. Austerlitz is the story of a man\u2019s search for the answer to his life\u2019s central riddle. A small child when he comes to England on a Kindertransport in the summer of 1939, Jacques Austerlitz is told nothing of his real family by the Welsh Methodist minister and his wife who raise him. \r\n\r\nWhen he is a much older man, fleeting memories return to him, and obeying an instinct he only dimly understands, Austerlitz follows their trail back to the world he left behind a half century before. There, faced with the void at the heart of twentieth-century Europe, he struggles to rescue his heritage from oblivion.\r\n\r\n\"Sebald stands with Primo Levi as the prime speaker of the Holocaust and, with him, the prime contradiction of Adorno\u2019s dictum that after it, there can be no art.\u201d The New York Times", "asin": "0812982614", "rank": "83821", "city": "Prague", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51cOfb1xTtL.jpg", "country": "Czechia", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
