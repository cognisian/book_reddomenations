As usual: Salgado is a warrant for the extraordinary. Everything which enters his exposure box is supreme: cryistallinilty and 'smoothness' combined (I know: a contradiction - but Salgado makes it to appear 'combined'). He's Herzog. Herzog is Salgado. I know this sounds simplistic. But in a land of small hands we have to point out the big hands - with verve. Some exposures in the bildband are also already published in \"Workers\". Nevertheless, this bildband rounds it up in regards to the power of fire and putting it under control by humankind (for the better or the worse).

At some 700 oil wells and an unspecified number of oil-filled low-lying areas they ignited vast, raging fires, sending billowing black clouds over the region and thousands of tons of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAs the desperate efforts to contain and extinguish the conflagration progressed, Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado traveled to Kuwait to witness the crisis firsthand. The conditions were excruciating. The heat was so vicious that Salgado\u2019s smallest lens warped. A journalist and another photographer were killed when a slick ignited as they crossed it. Sticking close to the firefighters, and with characteristic sensitivity to both human and envrionmental impact, Salgado captured the terrifying scale of this \u201chuge theater the size of the planet\u201d: the ravaged landscape; the sweltering temperatures; the air choking on charred sand and soot; the blistered remains of camels; the sand still littered with cluster bombs; and the flames and smoke soaring to the skies, blocking out the sunlight, dwarfing the oil-coated firefighters.\r\n\r\nSalgado\u2019s epic pictures first appeared in the New York Times Magazine in June 1991 and were subsequently widely published and awarded the Oskar Barnack Award, recognizing outstanding images on the relationship between man and the environment. Kuwait: A Desert on Fire is the first monograph of this astonishing series. Like Genesis, Exodus, and The Children, it is as much a major document of modern history as an extraordinary body of photographic work. \r\n\r\n\u201cThese images, many of which have never been published, demonstrate Salgado\u2019s ability to go beyond the limits of news photography and create powerful and lasting artworks.\u201d Royal Photographic Society, London", "asin": "3836561255", "rank": "901940", "city": "Kuwait", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jm5e8GUtL.jpg", "country": "Kuwait", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
