Loved how every character interacts and reacts differently to the sister. Also, loved the Alcatraz history."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Al Capone does my shirts is about, a kid named Moose Flanagan and he is going to move to Alcatraz for his autistic sister who needs to go to a special ED school with the name of Esther P. Marinoff school. The book also has many more characters and they focus more on Natalie even though moose is the main character I also feel that this book has a lot of twists and turns in it. The author Gennifer Choldenko who has also made other books like, notes from a liar and her dog. The book has 215 pages, the book is a fictional novel so, I would rate it a 3 out of 5 stars. Also for kids 12 and older. I think that way because this book talks about murderers, rapists and more. I think the book was very good and I enjoyed how they mentioned al Capone. I also enjoyed how Moose's sister, Natalie was autistic and the moment that I found out I understood the book a lot more and I also understood it more because I have a relative who is autistic so if you have an autistic relative it\u2019ll help you understand the book a lot better than if you did not. I thought the cover was creative with the photo of Alcatraz on it. This book is not in a series from what I know but I do know you should read it because I literally couldn\u2019t let go of it as I was reading. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I have."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Really easy and fun read. It is an engaging book that actively addresses autism. I had to read this book for an education class and I'm really glad that the teacher had assigned it. There's a reason why it got a medal. This is the first book of a series of 3. A little bit pricey, considering I found on at a used book store for 75 cents, but this one is of course new and has that new book smell. Worth the read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Would read againI love all the books in the entire seriesI hope u like it toHave fun"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book is about a kid named Moose who is 12 years old and his father who just got a job as an electrician on the island of Alcatraz.

But Natalie has autism, and when she's denied admittance to the school, the stark setting of Alcatraz begins to unravel the tenuous coping mechanisms Moose's family has used for dealing with her disorder.\r\nWhen Moose meets Piper, the cute daughter of the Warden, he knows right off she's trouble.  But she's also strangely irresistible.  All Moose wants to do is protect Natalie, live up to his parents' expectations, and stay out of trouble.  But on Alcatraz, trouble is never very far away.\r\n\r\nSet in 1935, when guards actually lived on Alcatraz Island with their families.  Choldenko's second novel brings humor to the complexities of family dynamics and illuminates the real struggle of a kid trying to free himself from the \"good boy\" stance he's taken his whole life.", "asin": "0142403709", "rank": "14264", "city": "San Francisco", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51c4E6NJrHL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
