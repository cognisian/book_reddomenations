I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the book considering that when I think of naval mutiny I think of the 1990\u2019s movie Crimson Tide, with high drama and intense acting.  The Caine Mutiny is at the opposite end of the intensity scale in almost every respect.This is a long, slow coming of age story in a time of war.  We are so used to being entertained by fast paced, action packed movies and books that I sometimes wonder if we have lost an appreciation for things that are a truer reflection of the movement of time.  The pace of the story gave the reader a true appreciation of the character development witnessed over the course of the book and of the nature of war.  After the fact, it is easy to think of war was a series of battles that were won or lost, but this glosses over the weeks and months of hurry up and wait that fill much of a military man\u2019s life.  Wouk captures the interminable endless feeling of war perfectly and likewise startles us with the infrequent, violent nature of battles and storms against this otherwise benign backdrop.This is all great stuff of course, but what made it a favourite read?  Wouk writes charmingly, with familiarity and wit.  He always seems to have the perfect word, the perfect little detail to convey a scene to the reader.  The story is, of course, the real draw.  And more than anything it is the simplicity of the story. It\u2019s the story of Willie Keith growing up in a time of war.  The story has a traditional arc that pulls the reader along and all of the supporting characters are fascinating in their own right and support this arc.  The angst and trouble that Willie experiences are ordinary and relatable.  There is a complete absence of social issues, events and characters to make the story \u201crelevant.\u201d  The backdrop of war gives the story context and allows Wouk to use it as prism to break out character, leadership and friendship.This was a great story with enduring character lessons for us."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a fantastic book and quite different from the movie, although I love the movie."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great novel---one of the best I've ever read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A classic"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "And pedestrian."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Liked it a lot.
