Hijuelos writes with a rhythm that is unmistakable. It\u2019s as if, as you read, there is a Cuban guitarist softly strumming in the background. Although he writes sometimes of brutality and heartache, Hijuelos provides a beautiful glimpse into what it means to be Cuban-American, to be thrust from one\u2019s country, longing to retain your birthright yet wanting to make it in your new country. In Hijuelos\u2019s novels, some make it, some don\u2019t. And the journey is the delight, even as we see characters so terribly flawed by their longings. Our House in the Last World tells of Alejo Santinio and his wife Mercedes as they raise their two sons in mid-20th century New York City, having immigrated from Cuba a few years before Castro took over the country. While other immigrant relatives and friends are adjusting to the new country, planting new roots, and gaining success, Alejo is a fish out of water. He struggles the entire time of his residency in NYC, taking out his frustrations on his wife and sons. Mercedes, meanwhile, is extremely unhappy and cannot cope with the poverty she\u2019s been thrust into by her husband. She endures his spending their money on others, hoping to impress them, and she endures his brutality toward her, all the while suffering the hatefulness of Alejo\u2019s sister Buita who despises Mercedes and would do anything to rip Mercedes\u2019s two sons from her to raise as her, Buita\u2019s, own. Our House in the Last World is a powerful examination of how we deal with our fates, and ultimately, despite the fact it portrays a man whose life seems wasted and thrown away, we see that Alejo\u2019s sons and his wife grew from having known him."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This is a fascinating, well-written first novel by Oscar Hijuelos.  It's basically autobiographical, based on his family during his early years.  As many of us grew up in dysfunctional families to at least some degree, we can relate and appreciate his honest revelations.  Much sadness and loss, very descriptive.  Hijuelos writes of the complexities of the characters, the \"good\" and the \"bad\", strengths and weaknesses, and successful and unsuccessful coping strategies with forgiveness and understanding.  I found the last chapter \"Voices from the Last World\" especially satisfying, a glimpse into the worlds of three of the family members.  I look forward to reading more of his books."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Somewhat interesting, not nearly up to the standard of his later novels"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "This was a disappointment as a story.
