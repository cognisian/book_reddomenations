The event has attracted a spate of outsiders with deep pockets, big egos and, in the case of one young Englishman, an intriguing story about a lost Bugatti Type 57C. Having disappeared somewhere in France during World War II, and worth millions of dollars, it\u2019s among the most beautiful cars ever made, driving its pursuers mad with greed. \r\nWhen a local scholar turns up dead, Bruno suspects unnatural causes. Still, while life may offer its challenges\u2014often in the form of distractingly comely Parisiennes\u2014there is always time for a good bottle and a home-cooked meal.\r\n\r\n\u201cThrilling and truly \u00e9l\u00e9gante\u2026.
