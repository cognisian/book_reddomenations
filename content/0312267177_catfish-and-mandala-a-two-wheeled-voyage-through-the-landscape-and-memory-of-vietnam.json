Growing up as a boat person, then gang banger in East San Jose before his bicycling the length of Viet Nam, his memoir here is a search for identity, which he shares with us with so many of the outrageous encounters he encounters in his travels. Sprinkled with amazing meals and an appreciation of Vietnamese food that some will find discomfiting, they also serve as a prelude to his later cookbook. This book is a recounting of his family's travails and provides a keen, lyrical insight into one sensitive person's immigration and identity experience.
