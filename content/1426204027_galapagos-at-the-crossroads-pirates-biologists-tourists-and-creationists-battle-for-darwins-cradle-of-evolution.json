I liked the \"immersed journalism\" writing style which was captivating. The book provided me with a good view of the complex situation at the Galapagos both from a natural history as well as socio-economic perspective.On the negative side, I felt some repeatitions. It felt as though each chapter was written without regard to the fact that people/facts were already mentioned previously."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book helped me understand the politics of the Galapagos and all the competing influences on the status of the islands. It goes way beyond the normal tourist information and made our 3 week trip to the islands much more of a cultural experience."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Such a marvelous book looking at geopolitical, social, economic and environmental factors influencing the present and future of these islands.

The \"sciency\" information is presented in a very understandable and colloquial way so it is still fun to read.  The author writes in first person often and that always makes books more fun. Once we got to the Galapagos, I was really reminded of things from the book that were interesting.  Although we didn't make it to the Charles Darwin Research Station, I did get to see lots of feral cats and many other introduced species."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book was in great condition.

But soon today\u2019s 30,000 human residents could surpass 50,000. Add invasive species, floods of tourists, and unresolved conflicts between Ecuadorian laws and local concerns, and it\u2019s easy to see why the Gal\u00e1pagos were recently added to UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage in Danger list. \r\n\r\nEach chapter in this provocative, perceptive book focuses on a specific person or group with a stake in the Gal\u00e1pagos\u2019 natural resources\u2014from tour companies whose activities are often illegal and not always green, to creationist guides who lead tours with no mention of evolution, from fishermen up in arms over lobster quotas, to modern-day pirates who poach endangered marine species. \r\n\r\nBassett presents a perspective as readable as it is sensible. Told with wit, passion, and grace, the Gal\u00e1pagos story serves as a miniature model of Earth itself, a perfect example of how an environment can be destroyed-- and what is being done to preserve these islands before it's too late.", "asin": "1426204027", "rank": "1148721", "city": "Gal\u00e1pagos Islands", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51VF2PdrejL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
