My one star review is for this TRANSLATION. This review is in relation to the Tidball translation. I bought it based on a very good review written by another reader. I cannot review the whole book, but I can review the dedication, a poem of 4 stanzas. I can read French fairly well, but I wanted a translation to use to compare my own interpretation. I found in this one poem so many mistranslations - words either not understood, or simply changed for effect, that I quickly lost confidence in this translation. I am aware of the school of translation (in fact, there is a quote at the back of this book that refers to it) that suggests that the translation is a \"new poem\" will be \"faithful to the matter\" but will only \"approximate\" the form of the original, and the translated poem will become a \"new poem.\"In very rare cases this can work, provided the second poet is equal to the first, and is scrupulous in reflecting on the depth and complexity of the first, and then, develops the new poem in a new form that is also very fine.However, in this case, the first thing one notes is that Tidball does not translate basic words correctly. Or dense, banal, conventional imagery is substituted for something striking and profound,. For example, in line 3 Baudelaire writes:\"Jette ce livre saturnien,\"  Tidball translates this as: \"Throw out this misanthropic book.\"Let's begin with Jette. It is the imperative form of the verb Jeter , which means: to throw, to throw away, to cast (away). I think that to write \"throw out\" is a banal reformulation of what Baudelaire means - which is more like to \"cast it away from you\".But, this is not that important. What struck me about this line was the translation of \"livre saturnien\" as \"misanthropic book\". Of course, livre is book, but the adjective \"misanthropic\" felt wrong as a translation of \"saturnien\", which struck me as much more complex and interesting as a word. So I began to investigate the meaning of \"Saturnien.\"  My French Dictionary - a pretty big and heavy Petit Larousse (2008) translates \"Saturnien\" as having to do with Saturn ( the planet), and then adds a Literary Translation as: \" Triste, m\u00e9lancholic.\" This means: sad, melancholic. Another dictionary defines Saturnien as \"sombre et melantholique.\" \"Sombre\" can be defined as: dark, somber, gloomy.\" So, we are beginning to get the idea of what saturnien might mean. Now, my French is only mediocre. Probably a professor at the Sorbonne could explain much much more about what Baudelaire meant. But at least we have a rough idea  of the meaning of the word.What does Tidball translate it as? \"Misanthropic.\" Misanthropic is an adjective, from the root noun \"misanthrope.\" This word is defined in my Oxford English Dictionary as \"a person who hates mankind/a person who avoids human society.\" It might interests the reader who is reading my comments - if any poor soul perseveres through this important pathway of definition. - that the French also have the word \"misanthrope\" (noun) and the related word \"misanthropique.\"  Thus, Baudelaire could have used the exact word Tidball used, had he wanted to use it.So, what does all this mean? What it means is that Baudelaire calls his book of poems \"dark/sad/somber/gloomy\" and Tidball translates this as \"one who hates/avoids society\", which strikes me as a dumbed-down clich\u00e9 of the incredible richness, subtlety, genius, and darkness that that Baudelaire embodied. I could take 3 or 4 other words from the same Dedication poem and do the same thing with them as I have done here, had I the time and the stomach for it.At this point, I do not really care what Tidball does with his \"new poem\" because he has falsified and banalized what Baudelaire wrote, in a way that strikes me as doing great injustice to readers, the beauty and truth of poetry, and to Baudelaire himself.Of course, I have judged the entire book based on this one poem. This is true. Perhaps he had an off-day when he translated this one, and the rest sparkle as rooted in the complexity and genius of Baudelaire, yet like Eliot's Wasteland, transcend the original source. I hope so, but I won't find out, as I'm not going to read any more of Tidball.I leave it to you readers to try for yourself.Robert Girvan"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Weird!
