Brilliant and grotesque."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I haven't laughed out loud so much reading a book in YEARS.  I gave the German edition to my son and he told me the translation couldn't have been as funny.  But it is.  Never has a clueless character been so funny. It took a few pages to get into but the rest had me in stitches, literally.  It reminded me a bit of Hans Helmut Kirst's Gunner Asch books."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I read this book in the original German. An angry (I think) satire of the old DDR, it was incredibly funny in places. The parents of the main character are appalling, and yet possible in systems outside the Eastern Bloc as well I suspect. But the book also had an awful lot about sex from the point of view of a frustrated teenage boy, fairly graphic stuff. It got tiresome for me, not entirely because of prudishness on my part, but because so much of it was unpleasant and therefore unpleasant to read. Gross-out humor you could say. It did kind of spoil it for me, hence 3 stars rather than 4. (There was a similar trend to obscenity in Russian literature after the fall of Communism, partly because it was so new to them maybe and partly as a way to try to express the obscenity of the system they had been living under?) Christa Wolf comes in for some nasty treatment at the end of the book as well, she is an icon of East German literature. So that was shocking to me, but very funny and I suspect right on target."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "\"The story of the Wall's end is the story of my penis\" proclaims the hero of this ribald satire on the third page, giving readers a very clear idea of what they are in for. On the one hand, a brilliant and often hilarious alternative history of life in East Germany in the years preceding the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. On the other hand, a Bildungsroman starring a very unlikely hero, Klaus Uhltzscht (wonderful name!), a mama's boy with an obsessive interest in his sexual apparatus. How the surprise transformation of that apparatus from pathetically inadequate to gigantic led to the reunification of Germany is the story line of the novel, which is a kind of cross between G\u00fcnther Grass' THE TIN DRUM and Philip Roth's PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT, but still very much its own thing.Perhaps I should add Joseph Heller's CATCH-22 to that list. By far the funniest section of the book is the middle, when Klaus has joined the Stasi (the infamous secret police of the DDR) as an officer cadet. At least he thinks it is the Stasi. All he can get from his superiors are cryptic reminders that \"You know what kind of outfit you are in.\" But is his group the official Stasi, or a counter-Stasi, or a Stasi plant to distract attention from the real Stasi? All he knows is that their function is \"the negation of negation,\" whatever that means. One of his superiors, who had once taken a course in philosophy, has a habit of illustrating his points with totally irrelevant analogies. Another breaks all his sentences into numbered sub-headings: \"We always have pretzels here. It is (a) everyone's responsibility to (b) ensure that we never run out of pretzels.\" Most of Klaus' work consists of mounting months-long surveillance on apparently random locations, on the principle that \"the criminal always revisits the scene of the crime.\"As a teenager, Klaus goes to great lengths to obtain a copy of the East German sex manual, MANN UND FRAU INTIM. He does not have much success with its, shall we say, interactive sections, but he rivals Roth's Portnoy in the matter of self-gratification, and is soon exploring some of the practices in the book's final chapter on perversions, and even going beyond it. Indeed, Klaus, who once saw himself as a future Nobel Prizewinner, now sees himself as a sexual pioneer adding to the glory of the Socialist Ideal. I have to say that some of this writing becomes rather tiresome, but take away its more lurid aspects and there is a great deal of truth there. Anyone who has grown up as a rather nerdish boy in a restrictive atmosphere, simultaneously curious and ashamed, feeling the odd-man-out in any group of his peers, will see something of himself in poor Klaus.No, where I found I lost company with Klaus was in the political aspects of the book. It was a huge success on its publication in Germany in 1995, and you can see why. Br\u00fcssig's satire would surely have hit very specific targets with those who had lived through recent history, whereas for non-German readers it is funny enough but somewhat generic. In particular the end of the book, dealing with the Alexanderplatz demonstration and the breech of the Wall, depends a lot on references to the work of an East German writer called Christa Wolff, a name unknown to me. So just at the point where fact and fancy should have met, the book largely lost me. A pity -- but the rest of it was unique and great fun."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Brussig's\u00a0Heroes Like Us\u00a0is hugely entertaining as a novel and it is also highly educational: it throws open a gigantic picture window on a culture that we \"cold-warriors\" largely had to imagine for ourselves.  East Berlin, East Germany, the Stasi.  So many secrets, so much mystery, so much inhumanity.  But as we might have guessed, the Stasi was so big and pervasive that it was ripe for lampooning, especially now that the wall has fallen and the Stasi is no longer a threat.  In terms of per-capita employment it was the largest secret police force the world has ever seen and it influenced everyone's life on both sides of the Wall. An East German Portnoy*, Klaus Uhltzscht is the son of a mid-level Stasi functionary and a public health engineer mother.  Klaus tells his story to a reporter from the New York Times (rather than to a psychiatrist) and we spend the entire novel trying to figure out how Klaus can lay claim to having caused the fall of the Berlin Wall. The journey is fascinating and fun; it is also irreverent and obscene. For so many of us there was only the spy-novel image of a captive and oppressed people, living in a black and white city where it is always night and there is no traffic.  It's an entirely new perspective on late-GDR East Berlin and its inhabitants, who in the end are just... heroes like us.  The translator gets a lot of credit and his job was so obviously difficult that I will try to find the original in German** and compare notes. I haven't read much German since college, but I think this will be worth the effort.*\u00a0Portnoy's Complaint**\u00a0Helden wie wir"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I started studying Germany a few years ago, including the DDR and some of its history.This book is an entertaining fictional story set in East Germany in the 1980s for the most part. Considering the typical american doesn't have any idea what is was like \"behind the iron curtain,\" and because I am interested in the DDR, the setting for the story was extremely well-suited for me.Besides that, being a liberal young male helped also, as the protagontist Klaus explains his every thought on growing up, puberty and misunderstandings about those subjects that are gradually straightened out as he gets older.His obsessive thoughts and little over-explanitory details get a bit tiresome as the story progresses (the story is written in the 1st person), but I was laughing a lot while reading this one. Very entertaining and unique."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "a fine newish book from germany.... brussig has a similar bite to philip roth... facing real issues especially the german fear of being german...."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I laughed from page 2 to the last.  Brussig is an imaginative and talented writer that truly knows the meaning of satire.

The slightly  ironic style of Thomas Brussig took possession of me. The action mainly  takes place in the area where I was born and so I could comprehend how  \"hero\" Klaus experiences his surroundings.
