In my opinion Flann O'Brien ranks up there with Joyce and Nabokov as the world's best writers. The poetic flow of this book is beyond amazing. And that's just the writing: the plot is a work of staggering originality. A story within a story and on and on until the reader doesn't care because he/she is so swept up in the fun and joy of what is going on at that exact moment on that very page.
