By following four young medical students and physicians \u2013 Ming, Fitz, Sri and Chen \u2013 this debut collection from 2006 Scotiabank Giller Prize winner Vincent Lam is a riveting, eye-opening account of what it means to be a doctor. Deftly navigating his way through 12 interwoven short stories, the author explores the characters\u2019 relationships with each other, their patients, and their careers. Lam draws on his own experience as an emergency room physician and shares an insider\u2019s perspective on the fears, frustrations, and responsibilities linked with one of society\u2019s most highly regarded occupations.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wanted to write about the way in which a person changes as they become a physician \u2014 how their world view shifts, and how they become a slightly different version of themselves in the process of becoming a doctor,\u201d Lam explains. \u201cI wanted to write about the reality that doing good and trying to help others is not simple. It is ethically complicated and sometimes involves a reality that can only be expressed by telling a story.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the book\u2019s first story, \u201cHow to Get into Medical School, Part 1,\u201d students Ming and Fitz wrestle with their opposing personalities and study techniques, while coming to terms with a growing emotional connection that elicits disapproval from Ming\u2019s traditional Chinese-Canadian parents. Lam\u2019s exceptional talent for describing scenarios with great precision is showcased in \u201cTake All of Murphy,\u201d when Ming, Chen, and Sri find themselves at a moral crossroads while dissecting a cadaver. Throughout the book, readers are treated to the physicians\u2019 internal thoughts and the mental drama involved with treating patients, including Fitz\u2019s struggle with self-doubt in \u201cCode Clock\u201d and Chen\u2019s boredom and exhaustion in \u201cBefore Light.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom delivering babies to evacuating patients and dealing with deadly viruses, the four primary characters in Bloodletting &amp; Miraculous Cures are made thoroughly human by Lam\u2019s insightful detail, realistic dialogue, and expert storytelling. The medical world is naturally filled with drama, but it\u2019s the author\u2019s ability to give equal weight to the smaller moments that really brings this book to life.", "asin": "0385661444", "rank": "1770620", "city": "Toronto", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/414EFv7Hd9L.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
