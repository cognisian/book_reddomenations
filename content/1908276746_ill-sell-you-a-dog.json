It is fascinating in its exploration though a wonderfully rueful narrator of a weird little boarding house, its manners and mores, as well as absolutely hilarious.  The explosively comic ending is. . .but I don't want to spoil it for anybody.

Reader's will enjoy."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Villalobos creates a compelling view into the entropic life of a former taco vendor whose life has been a series of disappointments, hovering on the periphery of art. He uses a volume of Aesthetic Theory as if it were a Holy talisman to disperse unwanted influences. I'd always thought writing was basically about getting laid. Villalobos' 80 year-old protagonist proves that point. He'll go to almost any lengths to get his equally aged neighbor and sometime Nemesis in the sack. This book joins the ranks of absurdist fiction alongside the works of Vonnegut and Heller (at least in my opinion!)"}]}, "authors": ["Juan Pablo Villalobos"], "isbn": "1908276746", "longitude": -99.1333416, "periods": ["2000s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "I'll Sell You a Dog", "word_cloud": "amazingly funny clever intellectual barb fly away dismal political situation star great filled typical cast character begin continue live retirement home get involve agent innocent missionary government agent literary salon neighbor way drunk artist intrigue reality blend perfectly ramble story point first exposure last human easy love fascinating exploration wonderfully rueful narrator weird little boarding house manner mores well absolutely hilarious explosively comic end want spoil anybody ever get involved seem increasingly crazy write memorable story great writer delightful translate spanish british find set dear heart funny clever captivate enjoy create compel view en tropic life former taco vendor life series disappointment hover periphery art use volume talisman disperse unwanted influence always think write basically get lay protagonist prof point go almost length equally age neighbor sometime sack join rank absurdist fiction alongside work least opinion", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Humour"], "summary": "Long before he was the taco seller whose \u2018Gringo Dog\u2019 recipe made him famous throughout Mexico City, our hero was an aspiring artist: an artist, that is, till his would-be girlfriend was stolen by Diego Rivera, and his dreams snuffed out by his hypochondriac mother. Now our hero is resident in a retirement home, where fending off boredom is far more grueling than making tacos. Plagued by the literary salon that bumps about his building\u2019s lobby and haunted by the self-pitying ghost of a neglected artist, Villalobos\u2019s old man can\u2019t help but misbehave: he antagonises his neighbors, tortures American missionaries with passages from Adorno, and flirts with the revolutionary greengrocer. \r\n\r\nA delicious take-down of pretensions to cultural posterity, I\u2019ll Sell You a Dog is a comic novel whose absurd inventions, scurrilous antics and oddball characters are vintage Villalobos.", "asin": "1908276746", "rank": "515815", "city": "Mexico City", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61-RjToIuCL.jpg", "country": "Mexico", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
