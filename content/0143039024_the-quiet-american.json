The 55,800 words of Greene\u2019s novel could have saved countless American and Vietnamese lives."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "All is fair in love and warThis truly awesome 1955 novel starts during the Korean War but is situated in French Indo-China, in particular in Vietnam, which struggled  towards independence in a disorganised, almost \u2018medieval\u2019 way, full of competing warlords with double agendas, lumped together by US observers as Communists. The reporter about this sideshow is Fowler, an elderly, cynical British news hack with issues back home and excellent local contacts,  incl. French colonial officials. He also maintains a beautiful, young girlfriend, Phuong.The quiet American is Pyle, young, shy and naive, a virgin in almost everything, a fresh recruit to the massive US economic advisory mission operating from Saigon. Phuong\u2019s matchmaking sister Hei dislikes Fowler. Phuong leaves him and moves in with Pyle. Not long after, Pyle is found dead (with mud in his lungs) near a riverside restaurant, fifty meters from where Fowler has dinner.These are the bare bones of a Shakespearian tragedy involving millions of Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese, the French colonial administration and army, a contingent of US secret agents and neutral bystander Fowler (first name Thomas as in \u2018Doubting Thomas\u2019): selfish, unwilling and unable to commit himself to any creed or ideology, respectful of local hardship and suffering, sometimes wishing for death, sometimes crying out for help from the entity he does not believe in.Pyle is a man of faith, trying to further democracy under the guise of a Third Way, protecting Vietnam from communism whilst undermining colonial rule by starving the French of weapons and supplying dissidents with materials to make IEDs. He saves Fowler\u2019s life in extreme circumstances; their discussions are searing because of their differences in worldview, ambitions and hopes, or lack thereof.\u201cThe Quiet American\u201d took Graham Greene (1904-91) three years to write. He was short-listed for the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1966 and -67, inauspicious years given the US\u2019 then-mounting involvement in Vietnam. Reading it late in 2017, seeing Caodaism the colourful, mixed  religion he briefly described on TV today, my humble verdict is: fresh as never before, a work of great scope and brilliance, a true classic, a must read."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "War mixes everything up. Or maybe everything is already mixed up and war just jumbles it around. Love and lust and vulnerability; ambition and power and youth. Ideologies and instincts, all shaken together and served upon a platter before a backdrop of steamy jungles or quiet dehydrated mountains in the third world.War is a third world affair; it has been now for generations. Theaters collapsed in upon themselves; fire-bombed towns; grand old cities occupied by crisply dressed soldiers drinking Champagne and dancing with elegant ladies dressed in white \u2013 concentration camps filled with the college educated, those were the wars of our grandfathers. Our wars, the wars that our fathers started are the wars of villagers against peasants \u2013 the under-trained against the poorly armed. Child soldiers with bloodshot eyes pointing an AK-47 at a passing car; an explosion planted in a market to kill vendors sitting cross-legged in front of a pile of dried fish. With an occasional drone strike to accent the difference, making it somehow absurd.The Quiet American is about this kind of war \u2013 war in third world Asia, Vietnam specifically. Rice farmers fighting street thugs. It is the story of a journalist and his love for a local girl which brings him into competition with a na\u00efve young American. It\u2019s a simple book \u2013 a simple story. Perhaps too simple, but well-enough written to elicit emotion.I made common cause, because we all know the types \u2013 those of us who know modern wars. Four of them, I think, for me \u2013 the wars I have known. The camps full of fly-covered children, bodies heaped in a pile as their blood drains into a small river seeking an exit. The jaded journalist, the ambitious diplomat, grandiose plans of nations built upon a foundation of the imperfect; like an oil painter swiping away reality with each pass of the brush, making her painting plain; cellophane wrapped like the west sees its wars.The book did take a surprising ending, especially for those who have seen the movie. I won\u2019t spoil it; but I will say that sometimes a sad ending can also be happy, and vice versa too."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "On second reading 40-plus years after original publication, Graham Greene's short and masterful novel \"The Quiet American\" seems profound and prophetic. (To many of us it seemed arrogant, stereotyped and anti-American in 1957). Alden Pyle, the quiet American,has been said by Greene biographers to be a takeoff of Edwin Lansdale, the model for William Lederer's \"The Ugly American,\" a favorable account of America in Asia written contemporaneous with Greene's novel. Today Alden Pyle could be seen as a character based on the Robert McNamara, Maxwell Taylor, Henry Cabot Lodge or Robert Komer of the 1960s. Greene's moral vision is as keen here as in any of his novels."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One one level, a truly amazing novel on love, betrayal and doubt. Graham Greene was my favourite writer when I was much younger, and I recently read The Quiet American for the third time. This time I more fully appreciated also the political insights of Greene, often referred to as a writer with an almost uncanny ability to visit and then describe a world of politics and revolutions at the right time.He was a flawed and ambivalent Catholic, and his battles with faith and doubt became the blood that lifted his novels to excellence.
