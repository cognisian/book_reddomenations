It was sometime in the late 70's or early 80's. I was just out of high school and completely bewitched by this book. I read it many, many times and then sadly lost it.  Years later ,with the wonders of technology, I was able to get another copy and copies of all Ms.Babitz's books. She is a lyrical, iconoclastic and brilliant writer. Her writing holds up. She should be more popular than she is. Buy anything by her- you won't be sorry. I consider finding her one of the highlights of my active reading life."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Stumbled across this book by accident in a southern California library and opened it only reluctantly.  But from page one, I was hooked, hooked, hooked.  This gal can write books like tornadoes can tear up neighborhoods.  Reading her (slightly fictionalized account) of growing up in LA was so thoroughly engrossing, I've tracked down and bought a (used) copy so I can re-read it from time to time - just to enjoy the verbal riffs she pulls off so (seemingly) effortlessly.If you liked Mary Karr's The Liar's Club, you'll LOVE this one.  Reading it a second and third time is like returning to your favorite restaurant and being served the best meal in the world - over and over again.  Deeply, richly, and very, very satisfying.Check it out.  It's truly timeless.

Immortalized as the nude beauty facing down Duchamp and as one of Ed Ruscha\u2019s Five 1965 Girlfriends, Babitz\u2019s first book showed her to be a razor-sharp writer with tales of her own. \r\n\r\nEve\u2019s Hollywood is an album of  vivid snapshots of Southern California\u2019s haute bohemians, of outrageously beautiful high-school ingenues and enviably tattooed Chicanas, of rock stars sleeping it off at the Chateau Marmont. And though Babitz\u2019s prose might appear careening, she\u2019s in control as she takes us on a ride through an LA of perpetual delight, from a joint serving the perfect taquito, to the corner of La Brea and Sunset where we make eye contact with a roller-skating hooker, to the Watts Towers. \r\n\r\nThis \u201cdaughter of the wasteland\u201d is here to show us that her city is no wasteland at all but a glowing landscape of swaying fruit trees and blooming bougainvillea, buffeted by earthquakes and the Santa Ana winds\u2014and every bit as seductive as she is.
