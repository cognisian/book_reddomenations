Pearl is eighteen, beautiful, and impetuous. She plays saxophone in an all-girl jazz band at the Trocadero and occasionally sits in on underground gigs with her twin brother, Martin, who also plays the sax. One evening, black GI and jazz legend James Washington blows into her life, and love begins to unfold against the blacked-out nights and rumor-filled days of a city in the grip of war. \r\n\r\nWhen James is shipped out to fight in New Guinea, Pearl hatches a breathtaking plan to reunite with him. And then all hell breaks loose. Internationally acclaimed author Mandy Sayer writes with astonishing insight and tenderness in this audaciously original novel\u2014a romance with a haunting jazz soundtrack and a war story like no other.\r\n\r\n\u201cI remember this time from my childhood, the concentration of fear and erotic hopes, and Mandy Sayer is brilliant as usual in both celebrating that time and transcending it in this remarkable love story for all desperate times and places.\u201d Thomas Keneally", "asin": "1451678460", "rank": "4807470", "city": "Sydney", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51TcfU0j6CL.jpg", "country": "Australia", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
