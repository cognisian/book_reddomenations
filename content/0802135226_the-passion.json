But, as I read the story swallowed me whole and really made an impact.  This story is unlike so much I have read, I highly recommend this book for anyone and everyone.  I don't want to say too much about the plot because you need to read it to fully appreciate what happens and whats going on.  I will say this:  It is a story about Passion, love, infatuation, how people steal your heart and never give it back.  It is not a \"romance novel\" that you buy for 99 cents at a dollar store, its a very real story that is about all different kinds of love, not just romantic.  This story is historical fiction but written like fantasy.  Great characters and an amazing plot.  If I could read this again for the first time, I would."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Brilliant.

The Passion is perhaps her most highly acclaimed work, a modern classic that confirms her special claim on the novel. \r\n\r\nSet during the tumultuous years of the Napoleonic Wars, The Passion intertwines the destinies of two remarkable people: Henri, a simple French soldier, who follows Napoleon from glory to Russian ruin; and Villanelle, the red-haired, web-footed daughter of a Venetian boatman, whose husband has gambled away her heart. In Venice\u2019s compound of carnival, chance, and darkness, the pair meet their singular destiny.\r\n\r\nIn her unique and mesmerizing voice, Winterson blends reality with fantasy, dream, and imagination to weave a hypnotic tale with stunning effects.", "asin": "0802135226", "rank": "168239", "city": "Venice", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51C4AbKRaHL.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
