Beautifully written, no blatant sex or bad language.  Why can't all books be written this way?

One learns their background, how to \"read\" post-Impressionist paintings.  What the Parisian girl must adapt to in the countryside without the Parisian \"conveniences\" she was used to.

Lisette regrets having to give up her dream of becoming a gallery apprentice and longs for the comforts and sophistication of Paris. But as she soon discovers, the hilltop town is rich with unexpected pleasures.\r\n \r\nPascal once worked in the nearby ochre mines and later became a pigment salesman and frame maker; while selling his pigments in Paris, he befriended Pissarro and C\u00e9zanne, some of whose paintings he received in trade for his frames. Pascal begins to tutor Lisette in both art and life, allowing her to see his small collection of paintings and the Proven\u00e7al landscape itself in a new light. Inspired by Pascal\u2019s advice to \u201cDo the important things first,\u201d Lisette begins a list of vows to herself (#4. Learn what makes a painting great). When war breaks out, Andr\u00e9 goes off to the front, but not before hiding Pascal\u2019s paintings to keep them from the Nazis\u2019 reach.\r\n \r\nWith German forces spreading across Europe, the sudden fall of Paris, and the rise of Vichy France, Lisette sets out to locate the paintings (#11. Find the paintings in my lifetime). Her search takes her through the stunning French countryside, where she befriends Marc and Bella Chagall, who are in hiding before their flight to America, and acquaints her with the land, her neighbors, and even herself in ways she never dreamed possible. Through joy and tragedy, occupation and liberation, small acts of kindness and great acts of courage, Lisette learns to forgive the past, to live robustly, and to love again.\r\n \r\n\u201cVreeland\u2019s love of painters and painting, her meticulous research and pitch-perfect descriptive talents . . . are abundantly evident in her new novel.\u201d The Washington Post", "asin": "0812980190", "rank": "68437", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519uh0jW5oL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
