Griet life alters dramatically  after meeting the painter, Vermeer!  Great movie too!  Highly recommend this book and to my surprise when I was in Italy, a street artist painted the pic below on the street!  Couldn't put the book down...great recommendation from a friend!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A fantastic book!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The Novel the Girl With The Pearl Earring Here why I like and dislike this. To start off with I give this book 4/5 stars because this book is good, but not great. There are only one thing  I would change and multiple things I wouldn't. For the ideas I would keep the same is the introduction of Great and her family. Another thing I would keep the same is Vermeer. One thing I would definitely change is Catharina's attitude.  To start off about what I wouldn't change is the intro of Griet and her family for many reasons, because When her father's kiln accident she had nothing to do but be a maid and earn money for her family because her father couldn't. I also like that she was cooking in the beginning because it showed Vermeer that she was the right choice. Talking about Vermeer I wouldn't change him for obvious and less obvious reasons. obviously, he was the painter and he drew this. But he also had a secret relationship with Griet. which brings me into Catharina and why I would take her out. She just has a crummy attitude and she held Vermeer back from draw great pieces of art in my opinion.  Well, that's my view on the book and why I liked it. Although I would change one thing, I wouldn't change it all"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very well written, sensitive, and allows the reader to feel and experience the strong emotions of the characters.
