From the images to the story to the characters, it\u2019s all as sharp as a freshly honed knife.  It took me a while to get into it but this tale of love & loss & forever running from/to something is part mystery, part magic & part polemic on how we hurt others & ourselves. Not exactly a upper but highly recommended."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This was my first Emily St. John Mandel book- I will read more. I appreciate the brevity of this book -it wasn't unnecessarily long, as some books often are- and I could have finished it in a shorter time than I did. Her characters will stay with you. Her writing is beautiful. This is haunting stuff."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I loved Station Eleven by Mandel, so I was excited to read this novel, too.  I was engaged throughout and think the characterization is realistic.  I was left a little disappointed with the conclusion, but, having said that, I'm not sure how else the plot might have been resolved.  All in all a good read--but not as good as Station Eleven."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Breath-taking!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I've become a huge fan, have read 3 of her novels, each with a quite different storyline but all with a beautiful writing style, such a joy!

There are parts where not much is going on except fever-dream passages that are mesmerizing in their repetition and trance-inducing incantations, and then they\u2019re just boring.  I can see where she\u2019s trying to go, but I guess I just didn\u2019t have the patience.  Might be better for angst-ridden young adults (i.e. I might have liked it more at age 20)."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I loved \"Station 11\"  and thought I would like this book too but it seemed too dark and the characters lacked likability.
