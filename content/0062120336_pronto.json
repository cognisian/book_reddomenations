To protect his position, he was forced to cut a deal with the local muscle, Jimmy Capotorto (Jimmy Cap to the likes of Harry), an even fifty-fifty split. For years Harry had been padding his own stake by skimming a grand a week off the top. A couple of local detectives wise to sticky fingers try to bag Jimmy the Cap by putting the squeeze on Harry. Now, the dicks suggest, would be a good time for Harry to rat the mobster out.\r\n\r\nU.S. Marshall Raylan Givens has his own agenda. He has to deliver Harry to a Federal grand jury to testify at Jimmy's drug-running trial. Even though he's a step slower that he used to be, Harry's no fool. When Jimmy Cap's men are a hair too slow gunning him down and Raylan's surveillance slips, Harry's already two steps ahead of them. Years of preparation pay off and Harry slips out of the country pronto. Being on the lam is no time to get soft, but Harry didn't plan on missing his companion Joyce so much. Sneaking her to his hideout could save him from loneliness but Joyce's quick departure tips off his trackers. Jimmy Cap's men follow Joyce while Raylan stays close behind. The three sides end up in Rapallo, Italy, watching their own backs while keeping abreast of Harry's. But it's not until the chase leads back to Miami that the real winners and losers are revealed. Pronto is classic Elmore Leonard\r\n\r\n\u201cSpeedy, exhilarating, and smooth.
