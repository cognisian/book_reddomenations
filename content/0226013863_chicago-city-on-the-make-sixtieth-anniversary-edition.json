Like loving a woman with a broken nose, you may well find lovelier lovelies. But never a lovely so real.\u201d\r\n\r\nErnest Hemingway once said of Nelson Algren\u2019s writing that \u201cyou should not read it if you cannot take a punch.\u201d The prose poem, Chicago: City on the Make, filled with language that swings and jabs and stuns, lives up to those words. In this sixtieth anniversary edition, Algren presents 120 years of Chicago history through the lens of its \u201cnobodies nobody knows\u201d: the tramps, hustlers, aging bar fighters, freed death-row inmates, and anonymous working stiffs who prowl its streets.\r\n\r\nUpon its original publication in 1951, Algren\u2019s Chicago: City on the Make was scorned by the Chicago Chamber of Commerce and local journalists for its gritty portrayal of the city and its people, one that boldly defied City Hall\u2019s business and tourism initiatives. Yet the book captures the essential dilemma of Chicago: the dynamic tension between the city\u2019s breathtaking beauty and its utter brutality, its boundless human energy and its stifling greed and violence.\r\n\r\nThe sixtieth anniversary edition features historic Chicago photos and annotations on everything from defunct slang to Chicagoans, famous and obscure, to what the Black Sox scandal was and why it mattered. More accessible than ever, this is, as Studs Terkel says, \u201cthe best book about Chicago.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAlgren\u2019s Chicago, a kind of American annex to Dante\u2019s inferno, is a nether world peopled by rat-faced hustlers and money-loving demons who crawl in the writer\u2019s brilliant, sordid, uncompromising and twisted imagination. . . . [This book] searches a city\u2019s heart and mind rather than its avenues and public buildings.\u201d New York Times ", "asin": "0226013863", "rank": "400362", "city": "Chicago", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51R-QR3sc6L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
