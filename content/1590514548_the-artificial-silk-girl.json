Maybe it's her confidence mixed with naivety that creates a level of youthful arrogance that kept me turning pages.  But where we see danger, Doris--our lead--sees opportunity.  And she takes every one of them.She begins her journal, our book, with such big plans; she will be a star, she will be rich, she will give people exactly what they have coming.  But every step she takes is a step downward--little steps, quarter turns that barely register until she's hit the bottom.  Towards the ends the narrative becomes almost frantic as painful memories and realizations collide with her desperate situation. You can feel her spiraling out of control, and you can feel the anxiety and heartbreak that come when you put someone before yourself for the first time.Unlike other reviewers, I found subtle references to the political climate of the era--although it could have just been me, reading it, knowing what was coming.While I found her attitude about sex fascinating considering the way previous generations have presented themselves (scrubbed clean and chaste), what I found even more surprising was how Doris hated the double standards and misogyny, but still used them to her advantage.  If you can't beat 'em, play 'em a little harder?I'm sure the Nazis had plenty of reasons for wanting to destroy this book.  I'm glad they failed.  I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Through first person narration, a woman in very early Nazi Germany tells her story in intimate detail.

Of course, she gets nowhere.  Although she\u2019s a petty criminal, marginally a prostitute (to survive), and dishonest, you get the sense that she really has a \u201cheart of gold.\u201d  (But she won\u2019t give up or give back the valuable fur coat she stole and loves so much\u2014a major theme woven throughout the story.) The book is absorbing and titillating in a friendly way.  It is told from the point of view of Doris as she writes in her notebook.  Doris is very perceptive about men and our sexuality.I read this in the original German.  I mean I tried to read it.  It is written in 1920s teenage German vernacular\u2014not easy for me since I mostly familiar with academic German.  There are also many passages that do not make much sense either in German or English translation which I referred to extensively.  Parts of the narrative have a stream-of-consciousness almost Faulknerian lack of structure or continuity.The translator takes liberties with her translation.  Here are just two of many hundreds of examples.  The German says \u201crushed at me like a storm wind.\u2019  Translation says \u201crushed at me like a hurricane.\u201d  German says \u201cI must I tell them that I am not Jewish?\u201d  Translation says \u201cI have to tell then that I am not into politics.\u201d  It may be that the translator was using a different edition of this famous book.  I was reading the original German first edition.  But that does not explain all the changes.  Why do translators not just translate instead of embellishing and rewriting?Reading novels like this I cannot help but think of the utter disaster looming over these characters just ten years on.  Their petty concerns will be swept up in catastrophe that Germany will go through in WW II.  And of course a lot of the issues that Doris and her friends face are a result of the disaster of WW I.This book is good tour through a lot of inter-war Berlin and its people and culture.  By the way, I think that artificial silk, Kunstseide auf deutsch, is rayon, or what they called rayon back then when it was still newish."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Just another book they make you read in school to try and find a deeper meaning that is not really there. May have been better if we got a better look at the spectacular era she was living in and not endless complaints about the men she slept with. If you have to get it for class just read the spark notes, you won't miss much."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I feel as though I have been in the driving seat of a woman's mind during the early 1930s of pre-Nazi Germany. Not just any kind of woman, though. The protagonist, Doris, with a lack of education, is a material girl who hopes to achieve a higher status in society by garnering the attentions of successful men and sleeping her way to the top. Three of them in fact, with varying degrees of success and conclusions. It is both funny and sad.Because it is a social critique, this novel's publication was banned by the Nazis. Mostly because of its honesty and openness regarding the subject of the book; The novel is a rich portrait of a working girl sleeping her way to the top and failing. It is relevant even today. The narrative reveals her inner thoughts and attitude towards men. A frightening prospect for the men in that era.The protagonist's thought process is flighty \u2013 jumping from idea to idea \u2013 and until you become accustomed to that pattern you may struggle to get into the flow of the story.The writing is really quite modern, even today. The way it has been constructed and written makes it timeless. I feel that we are fortunate that a version somehow still exists today. The story of how the book has survived the Nazi period is a tale in itself.The novel has three distinct sections that are quite symbolic and takes place mostly in Berlin, in the first person.Section 1 takes place at the tail end of summer.Section 2 takes place during late autumn.Section 3 journeys from winter into spring; finishing with hope, or so I like to think.Hope is a good way to finish such a tale.Sergiu Pobereznic (author)"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "(4.5 stars) First published in Germany in 1932, when author Irmgard Keun was only twenty-two, The Artificial Silk Girl, a bestselling novel of its day, is said to be for pre-Nazi Germany what Anita Loos\u2019s Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1925) is for Jazz Age America.  Both novels capture the frantic spirit, the eat-drink-and-be-merry ambiance, and the materialism of young people like Doris \u2013 and Lorelei Lee in the Loos book \u2013 who haunt the urban clubs as they try to work their way into a lifestyle much grander and more vibrant than anything their mothers could ever have hoped for.  Many attractive young women, regardless of their education and social experience, have set their hopes on becoming part of the privileged urban social scene, which they hope to achieve through the attentions of successful men with whom they flirt and seduce.In The Artificial Silk Girl, main character Doris starts out in a small city, where she wants to be an actress, while supporting herself as a stenographer and eventually writing a commentary about her life which author Irmgard Keun presents as Doris\u2019s point of view.  The authorities in Germany were not pleased, however, with Keun\u2019s published depiction of Berlin life as Hitler and the Nazis, preparing to take power, envisioned it.  Within a year, her books were confiscated and all known copies were destroyed.  In 1936, Keun, firmly opposed to Nazism, escaped Germany for Belgium, Holland, and later New York.Doris, the \u201cartificial silk girl,\u201d has no politics, focusing almost completely on her own ambitions, and the novel that follows is both fun and very funny, based entirely on the persona of Doris \u2013  totally goal oriented, unafraid to take chances, willing to do anything to get what she wants, and very clever.  Her voice \u2013 honest, bawdy, and surprisingly guileless \u2013 also shows her intelligence, and her pointed observations and insights into those around her give the author unlimited opportunities for unique descriptions:  One restaurant is \u201ca beer belly all lit up,\u201d and dancing the tango \u201cwhen you\u2019re drunk\u2026is like going down a slide.\u201d  Her feverish excitement at getting a small part in a show beguiles the reader, and when her outrageous behavior forces her to escape not only the theater but the city itself, the reader cannot help but root for her eventual success.Dividing the novel into three parts reflecting the seasons and the symbolism associated with them, the author creates a wild, spontaneous, free-for-all of action in Part I, which takes place at the end of summer. Part II begins in Late Fall in Berlin, a much larger city, and the reader expects that this will be a darker and probably more contemplative time.  The gradual change of mood here increases the reader\u2019s identification with Doris and her goals.  Part III, \u201cA Lot of Winter and a Waiting Room,\u201d introduces three men, each of whom affects Doris\u2019s life and future and helps bring about new recognitions by Doris and a realistic conclusion to the novel.  The book\u2019s timeless themes regarding women and how they see themselves, combine with history in a unique way, giving life to a less publicized period of history and new insights into the lives of some of the women who lived through it."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Holly Golightly on the eve of the Third Reich--a fascinating book, first a comedy, then very decidedly not.  I know of nothing quite like it, although Kastner's Going To The Dogs is sort of a male equivalent."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The book is not a pleasant read but a good one.  The main character is a girl who lives from day to day, totally self absorbed, in a Germany that offers little hope for a woman of the lower middle class - other than sleeping with men for survival, and occasionally pleasure.  She lives in the moment, thinks of little but clothes, men, and diversion.  I expected the German equivalent of \"Gentlemen Prefer Blonds.\"  This is darker, more telling, and much sadder.  Banned by Hitler's Germany, it is a small classic that beautifully portrays a certain kind of girl in her own time and place.  Think cigarette smoke, tawdry nights, and a girl with a mixture of cunning and naivete.  If you are looking for the glamor of \"Cabaret\" (The Berlin Stories) you won't find it here.  But you will get a snapshot of a lost world for which one can have little nostalgia."}]}, "authors": ["Irmgard Keun"], "isbn": "1590514548", "longitude": 13.3888599, "periods": ["1900s"], "title":

And before Bridget Jones was The Artificial Silk Girl. \r\n\r\nIn 1931, a young woman writer living in Germany was inspired by Anita Loos's Gentlemen Prefer Blondes to describe pre-war Berlin and the age of cinematic glamour through the eyes of a woman. The resulting novel, The Artificial Silk Girl, became an acclaimed bestseller and a masterwork of German literature, in the tradition of Christopher Isherwood's Berlin Stories and Bertolt Brecht's Three Penny Opera. \r\n\r\nLike Isherwood and Brecht, Keun revealed the dark underside of Berlin's \"golden twenties\" with empathy and honesty. Unfortunately, a Nazi censorship board banned Keun's work in 1933 and destroyed all existing copies of The Artificial Silk Girl. Only one English translation was published, in Great Britain, before the book disappeared in the chaos of the ensuing war. \r\n\r\nToday, more than seven decades later, the story of this quintessential \"material girl\" remains as relevant as ever, as an accessible new translation brings this lost classic to light once more. Other Press is pleased to announce the republication of The Artificial Silk Girl, elegantly translated by noted Germanist Kathie von Ankum, and with a new introduction by Harvard professor Maria Tatar.\r\n\r\n\u201cDamned by the Nazis, hailed by the feminists ... a truly charming window into a young woman\u2019s life in the early 1930s.\u201d Los Angeles Times\r\n", "asin": "1590514548", "rank": "334169", "city": "Berlin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vDVkM12UL.jpg", "country": "Germany", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
