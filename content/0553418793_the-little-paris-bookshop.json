On this barge, \"the length of three truck trailers\", he has created a book shop. But not just any book shop, it is the Literary Apothecary.In his bookshop, he divides his books, not by subject matter, but by effect. So if he feels a customer needs a book to overcome tragedy, he has a special set of books to recommend. Not only that, if he feels a book is wrong for you, he may refuse to sell it to you!Unfortunately, Perdu has not been able to heal himself. Or, more correctly, he hasn't tried. For 20 years he hasn't tried. This is the story of how unstoppable agents of change, in the shape of quirky characters indeed, eventually bring him back to life. Real, demanding and exhilarating life.I enjoyed \"The Little Paris Bookshop\" and even teared up a bit at one point. It can be a bit twee and there are times where it dragged or was repetitive. But there is some nice writing and interesting characters: \"He was rather fond of Madame Gulliver. She seized life with both hands. More of it than she probably needed.\"Nina George ends the book with some Provence-style recipes (for that's where Perdu ends his tale) as well as a short interview, discussing the book.In case you are interested, you can visit a real book barge in Paris. It's called the Water and Dreams book barge (in English), and they are happy to recommend a book for you.Happy Reader"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I felt bad for putting this book down, but at page 331, I couldn't handle it anymore.

This book makes you feel like you took a trip to France.  Nina George's description of Paris and the French countryside was lovely.  I enjoyed the story though it dragged at times.  However, I do recommend it."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "A little too much angst that goes on a little too long; lots of vivid and enjoyable descriptions of a river voyage through the French countryside. Twenty years is more than enough time to heal the wounds of lost love, and thus M. Perdu ( subtle?!) does not elicit the sort of sympathy the author hopes to invoke. The unlikely companionship of a few eccentric along the way populate the journey and provide some entertaining moments. The novel is a pleasant dalliance that asks very little from the reader."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Meh"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The Little Paris Bookshop introduces us to Monsieur Perdu, a man with a barge full of books and a heart full of pain.

But can he fix his own?\r\n \r\nMonsieur Perdu calls himself a literary apothecary. From his floating bookstore in a barge on the Seine, he prescribes novels for the hardships of life. Using his intuitive feel for the exact book a reader needs, Perdu mends broken hearts and souls. The only person he can&#039;t seem to heal through literature is himself; he&#039;s still haunted by heartbreak after his great love disappeared. She left him with only a letter, which he has never opened.\r\n\r\nAfter Perdu is finally tempted to read the letter, he hauls anchor and departs on a mission to the south of France, hoping to make peace with his loss and discover the end of the story. Joined by a bestselling but blocked author and a lovelorn Italian chef, Perdu travels along the country\u2019s rivers, dispensing his wisdom and his books, showing that the literary world can take the human soul on a journey to heal itself.\r\n\r\nInternationally bestselling and filled with warmth and adventure, The Little Paris Bookshop is a love letter to books, meant for anyone who believes in the power of stories to shape people&#039;s lives.\r\n", "asin": "0553418793", "rank": "5356", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ARgTQV8rL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
