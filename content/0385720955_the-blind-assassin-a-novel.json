I liked the writing but the story didn't draw me in until 75-100 pages in. However, I'm glad I stuck with it because as the story progressed and the pieces started fitting together, I ended up enjoying the book. I did have the ending pretty much figured out before it happened, but it all came together perfectly, and I did like the ending. I thought there was a little bit of revenge that Richard deserved.While this book wasn't my favorite, I'm definitely intrigued to read more by Atwood."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Fluid plot and prose, yet can stall in places to sluggish, a little bit like the main character herself.

But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a-novel.\r\n\r\nEntitled The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms.
