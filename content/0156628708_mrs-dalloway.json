I recall it as vividly now as when I first encountered it and getting involved in the story's stream of consciousness. I still remember the characters and the situation, including the conversations and as I write this, the feeling of the crisp weather as Clarissa goes about her day.There are some books that will always stay with me, including \"David Copperfield,\" \"War And Peace,\" the many short stories of Anton Chekhov, James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and some of the plays of William Shakespeare.They're not for everyone, but If I can interest one person into giving themselves permission to enter these incredible worlds and experience the magic spells they cast, I will be happy. They are \"classics\" for a reason. \"Mrs. Dalloway\" is one.Mrs. Woolf's writing, though challenging, can be devastating. \"Jacob's Room,\" \"The Waves\" and \"To The Lighthouse\" are, with \"Mrs. Dalloway,\" mind-altering experiences, truly some of the greatest examples of modernism in literature. I will now order it on my Kindle to see if I can recapture Mrs. Woolf's magic again."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Love this book"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I can\u2019t understand why people like this book.

The nice day reminds her of her youth spent in the countryside in Bourton and makes her wonder about her choice of husband; she married the reliable Richard Dalloway instead of the enigmatic and demanding Peter Walsh, and she \"had not the option\" to be with Sally Seton. Peter reintroduces these conflicts by paying a visit that morning.\r\n\r\nSeptimus Warren Smith, a First World War veteran suffering from deferred traumatic stress, spends his day in the park with his Italian-born wife Lucrezia, where Peter Walsh observes them. Septimus is visited by frequent and indecipherable hallucinations, mostly concerning his dear friend Evans who died in the war. Later that day, after he is prescribed involuntary commitment to a psychiatric hospital, he commits suicide by jumping out of a window.\r\n\r\nClarissa's party in the evening is a slow success. It is attended by most of the characters she has met in the book, including people from her past. She hears about Septimus' suicide at the party and gradually comes to admire this stranger's act, which she considers an effort to preserve the purity of his happiness.", "asin": "0156628708", "rank": "11602", "city": "London", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51NpuQ0xPAL.jpg", "country": "England", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
