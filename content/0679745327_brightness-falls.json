I read this book nearly twenty years ago, yet the characters and story still resonant within me. Our culture is ruled by greed, unbridled ambition and more of everything. This is the fuel for our very lives \u2013 a good citizen today is a good consumer. Our responsibility, if we do not wish for the house of cards to fall, is to buy lots of crap \u2013 crap we not need, with money we do not have to impress people we do lot like!Brightness Falls features the quest of a couple for the golden ring \u2013 wealth, fame and privilege.It is a story about all of us \u2013 about Americans who came of age in the Reagan Era and beyond. It speaks the truth about what rests in our hearts. To be rich. Why? The rich live a different life. This is the story we have been told, and sold, anyway. Over last century, beginning with the stories of Horatio Alger, we\u2019ve been indoctrinated with the \u00a0belief that every man can attain high-society status. Everyone can be rich, famous and \u201cimportant.\u201d One he does so, all of his troubles will disappear.For many, this has become an obsession \u2013 one for which they will sacrifice their morals, ethics and their very soul to attain. We have witnessed this time and again over the past 30 years. Watch Wall Street, The Smartest Guys in the Room, Margin Call, or Glengarry Glen Ross for great depictions \u2013 real and fictional \u2013 of our ethical slide.Brightness Falls\u00a0places us in the front row of this mania\u2013 to witness the gradual surrender of everything of importance to two individuals \u2013 all in exchange for the chance to strike it rich. The scenes I remember the most are those involving the main characters father \u2013 who is a retired auto worker living a simple, frugal life in Michigan on his pension. The conversations between son and father were heartbreaking \u2013 as the son buried all the values of his Mid-western upbringing in exchange for the values of the big city. Father and son had nothing in common. The wholesome values of the father didn\u2019t produce enough fruit fast enough for the son.This is the story of our times. We look to the founders of Facebook and Google \u2013 billionaires before 30 \u2013 free to live large, never to punch a clock or drudge through a morning commute. We all want what they have \u2013 and we want it now, while we\u2019re young. We do not wish to work, earn, save, and grow. Unfortunately, we do not recognize that from the simple life comes great wisdom. Only through years of experience \u2013 of seeing it all \u2013 can one begin to understand the world and our place in it. In Brightness Falls we see the crash in slow motion. We see how every decision impacts relationships and compromises the individuals involved. We can see what will happen and learn from the experience of these characters. Slow and steady wins the race!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I really enjoyed Bright Lights, Big City - also by Jay McInerney - so I picked up this novel as well. It is fantastic - I highly recommend it. It follows the story of the Calloways who outwardly appear to be a super-successful, young NY power couple. But like many relationships, things are a little different behind closed doors. There are a handful of other characters in the novel who are interesting to follow as well. This novel is interesting to read for a peak at young, high-class life in New York City. It's also just interesting for how promising young careers and relationships can wither and tarnish over time. As in Bright Lights, McInerney has plenty of interesting observations and truths to drop on the reader."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Very Good, Interesting Story"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Jay McInerney was a decent novelist before he began his Calloway trilogy, capturing some of the quirky characters of '80s Manhattan in a satisfactory way, but 'Brightness Falls' is where he really turned into a chronicler of the city's saga in the way of his idols like Fitzgerald. Falls begins the story of Russell and Corinne Calloway, a young married couple navigating life in late '80s, stock-market crazed Manhattan. Russell is a dissatisfied, idealistic book editor looking for a better future, Corrine is beautiful but full of doubts, and McInerney takes us through a ride of heartbreak and nostalgia as no other contemporary novelist has. Read this, 2006's The Good Life, and 2016's \"Bright, Precious Days.\" You'll feel as if you've lived Russell and Corinne's lives with them, a journey well worth taking."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is the first book by McInerhey that follows NYC alpha-couple Corrine and Russell.  It is a technical firecracker, with dazzling edgy depictions and satire of NYC 1980s capitalist shallowness, and the very real emotional desires of humans both trapped within and promoting cutthroat cynicism and power games. The book is dominated by sexual predators and is occasionally problematic from a feminist point of view, though in McInherhey's favour he \"describes cynically,\" and emphatically does not \"justify\" much of the chauvinism in this book. Perhaps the empathy his characters possess in their most difficult moments barely overcomes the machismo present in so much of the book.If the book retained only the scandal and cynicism, the sexual machismo and predation, it would be a no-go.  However, there is just enough sympathy and objectivity in the writing style to see and feel the characters, and thus to begin to like them, even.  In the end this book is a page-turner, and at best it truly brings the characters and their lives from the page directly into the conscious minds of the reader."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Lovely writing style: smart but kind with a charming turn of phrase."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Jay McInerey's best book.
