Now it's going to as a birthday gift to family.  Many readers of historical China news will find familiar names - Emily Hahn, Victor Sassoon. Grescoe had done really in-depth research as well. I totally recommend this for anyone interested in 20th century Shanghai history, and the history of westerners / expatriates in China."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Expatriate life in Shanghai, 1935-1939, focusing primarily on Micky Hahn, a promiscuous adventurer and talented writer, but also her lover Zau Sinmay, a  Chinese poet and small scale publisher, and Victor Sassoon a very wealthy Jewish bachelor  who built and owned the famous Cathay Hotel (now the Peace Hotel). Character and writing make for a fascinating story, but I suspect the author used a novelist\u2019s imagination at times.  I read two professional reviews, but none compares what Grescoe has to say about Hahn\u2019s inner thoughts to original sources and certainly Grescoe does not really help.  When Grescoe relates Hahn\u2019s character to her being a youngest child, I suspect that is all him. The extra-national areas of Shanghai during that period were a very cosmopolitan enclave visited by many Western notables \u2013 Noel Coward wrote the first draft of \u201cPrivate Lives\u201d while laid up in the Cathay with the flu.  Grescoe provides enough historical and political background, especially if occasionally supplemented with Wikipedia."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "My husband and I both read the book and thought (until we got to the ending) that it was a novel.We;d been to Shanghai years ago, but certainly didn't explore it the way Taras Grescoe did.A pleasure to read.Note: Taras also wrote a travel article about Shanghai in the NYTimes."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I wonder if it is still possible for adventurous expats to live so large in today's world -- anywhere?

After checking in to Sassoon&#039;s glamorous Cathay Hotel, Hahn is absorbed into the social swirl of the expats drawn to pre-war China, among them Ernest Hemingway, Martha Gellhorn, Harold Acton, and a colourful gangster named Morris \"Two-Gun\" Cohen. But when she meets Zau Sinmay, a Chinese poet from an illustrious family, she discovers the real Shanghai through his eyes: the city of rich colonials, triple agents, opium-smokers, displaced Chinese peasants, and increasingly desperate White Russian and Jewish refugees\u2015a place her innate curiosity will lead her to explore first hand. Danger lurks on the horizon, though, as the brutal Japanese occupation destroys the seductive world of pre-war Shanghai, paving the way for Mao Tse-tung&#039;s Communists rise to power.", "asin": "1250049717", "rank": "376103", "city": "Shanghai", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513-TGFXNLL.jpg", "country": "China", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
