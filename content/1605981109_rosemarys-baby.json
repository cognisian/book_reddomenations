Rosemary and Guy move into the Bramford - a prestigious apartment that everyone wants to move into. This is the decade when all of the horror movie classics were released, including\u00a0Psycho and\u00a0The Night of the Living Dead. A year after\u00a0Rosemary's Baby\u00a0was published, it also joined the list of the movie classics, and a Google search will show you that the movie seems more popular than the book! 1967 is also around the time of the Vietnam war, so it is not surprising that the classic horror movies came out in this time period. They are a means of escape, of seeing monsters outside of people's own reality.I learned a while ago that if you are desperate to have something, that decision is most likely illogical. Anything I have wanted desperately that I ever got was something I regretted later. For example, I am from Canada, but my husband got a job in the U.S. I desperately wanted to stay in Canada, even though his American job not only paid double what he would make in Canada, it is also cheaper to live. Luckily, my husband\u00a0pushed us to leave because we are better off now than we would have been in Canada.So, I knew from the beginning of the novel that nothing was going to go right.Guy and Rosemary already signed a lease for another apartment and lied their way to break the lease so they could get the apartment at the Bramford. Although it is a beautiful apartment, it is smaller and older. However, Rosemary pushes for it because it is the apartment of their dreams. Even though her friend Hutch warns against it because of the weird accidents and deaths that happen there. Even though the guests are a bit odd and nosy.\u00a0One thing that this novel made me think about is how most horror stories somehow link to the past. This gives the impression of an evil entity that surpasses time and is more indestructible. Horror movies such as\u00a0The Conjuring\u00a0do similar things by showing the \"original\" story of the monsters and give the impression that this evil will never die. However, something has to be said about older societies that make it easier for these evil entities to take hold.\u00a0The only thing about this movie that I would complain about is the fact that, in this modern age, we know exactly what will happen in the classic horror stories. Almost from the beginning, I knew what would happen, so nothing was much of a surprise. If you do not mind knowing pretty much what will happen next - give this book a shot! It is a fun and easy read that will get you to pass the time without having to think too much.\u00a0Although this story is not a surprise, and it may make you annoyed, the classic horror feel you get brings you back to a different era, and allows you to enjoy a few simple hours of your day.\u00a0Who Should Read this Novel:- Fans of the classic horror movies and horror novels.- Those who like an easy and entertaining read."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Such a good book and movie, how rare is that????"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A classic for a reason. I've heard that when asked if you should read the book or see the movie, Stephen King said, \"Either will do.\" And as often has been commented on, the film is one of the closest adaptations to exist. But do read the book!  Ira Levin's writing in this novel is worthy of study. His prose hits with a surgical precision that one almost never sees. Even with my familiarity of the plot, I was kept on the edge of my seat as the tendrils of paranoia reached off the page. I only wish I had read it earlier. Highly recommended!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I put this on my TBR after reading a post about it written by someone on Wordpress and it did NOT disappoint. She recommended not reading the blurb beforehand, so I went in cold and I'd like to echo that suggestion. Do NOT read the blurb beforehand! It definitely gives away part of the plot and, imo, is a better read if you don't know. Anyway, it was a great book, spooky without being scary scary. It actually pulled me out of a bit of a reading slump, which was great! Drags on a bit occasionally, but overall very good."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "not a literary wonder ; a quick read"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Rosemary's Baby is not very scary but it was pretty strange and I enjoyed it.Rosemary and her husband were really wanting to get into the Bramford apartment complex and right when they had signed a lease on another apartment it becomes available and Rosemary begs her husband Guy to get them out of the lease and into the Bramford. Wrong move on her part! :)Not real long after they had been living there they meet an old couple who really seems to take over their lives but Rosemary doesn't see it until it's to late. Rosemary doesn't see a lot of things till it's too late. I know I keep saying wake up woman!It wasn't to long after they met the old couple that Guy gets his big break in acting and it seems he is on fire with his career and then Rosemary gets pregnant and that is when the old couple really become a bit obsessed with her and the care of her baby, they even get her to go to a doctor they recommend, give her\u00a0 vitamin drinks, etc.Like a lot of older horror it was more atmospheric than scary. The reader can see what his happening and is worried for Rosemary though she is a bit slow to realize what is happening. There was a few times I really wanted to scream at Rosemary for not catching onto things that were happening around her.The ending is a little strange and well I don't know. I am not even sure what I was expecting. I do think I am glad that I read this one before seeing the movie and now I would like to watch the movie. (Seeing the movie ruined my enjoyment of The Exorcist novel).I am reading this book called Paperbacks from Hell and it's the history of the horror industry from the 70's and 80's and the author says there was three books that really was a turning point for horror and those are The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby and The Other. So I have one more to go and I will have all three read. :) Let me tell you this book is wreaking havoc on my TBR...lol.Even though it's classed as horror I think I would put it as more suspense than horror, especially towards the end. I would recommend it to those who might like a little spooky suspense as it would be great for those who don't like to get to scared. I know a few of you out there...lol."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I still don't know what to think about this book.The story line & details of information were very well explained, in a very appropriate amount of time. However, the specific points of focus/detail, gave the plot/mystery away.The build up was very good & kept me interested the whole way through. Even to the end, the very end.. but that's where it stops. The book LITERALY stops, right when there is so much more to be explained. There is a whole story still to be told.. but It just ends. With no warning."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Read this book a long time a ago and wanted to revisit the story in its original format.  Although the movie follows the book and dialog very closely I still found it an enjoyable read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A darkly brilliant classic tale of the mundane becoming highly sinister.I'll admit to being a ROSEMARY \"virgin.\" Seriously, had never read this book (or seen the movie in its entirety)--and it's celebrating 50 years this fall.Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse are newly-wed and moving into their first NYC apartment, The Bramdford (known in real-life as The Dakota). Guy is struggling actor who has appeared in a few commercials and radio, Rosemary is an innocent housewife. Grandparent-like neighbors come nosing around and soon befriend the couple, though Rosemary has some reservations about them; she just wants to hang out with people her own age.I had expected ROSEMARY'S BABY to much more scary than it is. In many ways, it reads like a contemporary psych thriller ala B.A. Paris meets Shari Lapena. It's a fast, easy read but an undercurrent of sinister and discomfort pulses through every line, every scene; something's 'off,' but what?Of course, we all know (not even having had the book, I knew the general plot/premise). Still, I was surprised and wow-ed with Levin's deft and subtle plotting, propelling me to keep turning those pages. Plus, I loved Rosemary's interest in home decor and also the architecture of the old apartment building.There's also a few 'mental illness' moments that satisfied my psych suspense reading. Such a well-done tale."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Tired from a stream of \"serious\" literature, I recalled previously enjoying an Ira Levin book.Searching under his name, my goodness(!), I was struck by how many were familiar titles - many made into blockbuster movies of my childhood.Well, having chosen Rosemary's Baby for my quick confection of a read, I am now inclined to devour (or re-devour, for those I read a jillion years ago) his entire catalog.No, it's not literature to brag about, it's something different, but equal: immersive storytelling.
