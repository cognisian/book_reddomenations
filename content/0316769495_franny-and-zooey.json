So this review is on the Kindle version, which I purchased as my original has been read so often it is dog-eared and falling apart. The Kindle version is a mess and almost unreadable. Zero care was put into the formatting, leading to words being hyphenated in the middle of sentences (when my guess is that in the book they were hyphenated at the end of the printed line). Some pages loses their formatting halfway through and suddenly read like a haiku. I can't even read this version as it pulls me out of the story completely. This book deserved better treatment."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I have to admit that I found most of this book disturbing because the characters are so unlikeable.Zooey is worst. He is so smug and sarcastic, I cringed on almost all the words he spoke. The way in which he addressed his mother was, frankly just awful to read. And she isn\u2019t that likable either. The grown children in this story almost seem like today\u2019s millennials \u2013 so disillusioned and unhappy, even with all the blessings they have.  Spoiler alert: Even though both Franny and Zooey seem to have some type of positive epiphany at the end, I\u2019m not hopeful it will last for them. They\u2019re just too entitled. That\u2019s about all the story is: a story of entitled people"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "It's a wonderful 5-star book, as always, but the Kindle version has a lot of formatting problems.

Both stories are early, critical entries in a narrative series I'm doing about a family of settlers in twentieth-century New York, the Glasses. It is a long-term project, patently an ambiguous one, and there is a real-enough danger, I suppose that sooner or later I'll bog down, perhaps disappear entirely, in my own methods, locutions, and mannerisms.
