In this country notorious for its use of concealment and isolation as social control\u2015where scissors-wielding censors monitor the papers, the de facto leader of the opposition has been under decade-long house arrest, insurgent-controlled regions are effectively cut off from the world, and rumor is the most reliable source of current information\u2015he turns his gaze to the everyday for a sense of the big picture.\r\n\r\nDelisle's deft and recognizable renderings take note of almsgiving rituals, daylong power outages, and rampant heroin use in outlying regions, in this place where catastrophic mismanagement and ironhanded rule come up against profound resilience of spirit, expatriate life ambles along, and nongovernmental organizations struggle with the risk of co-option by the military junta. The Burma Chronicles is drawn with a minimal line, and interspersed with wordless vignettes and moments of Delisle's distinctive slapstick humor.", "asin": "177046025X", "rank": "145555", "city": "Myanmar", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511vYEZiqRL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
