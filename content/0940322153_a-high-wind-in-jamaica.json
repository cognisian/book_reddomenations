Started reading it and was so disgusted that I had to stop, which is rare for me. It was so explicitly gory, with detailed horror in almost every paragraph, and with that horrible cover drawn by a KNOWN PEDOPHILE (Google Henry Darger and his many drawings of naked children, little girls. Child porn.) When I saw the cover, I should have known what kind of book this was. This is NOT a classic. Good God. How do they get away with claiming that it is? It's a book of deep dark hellish people, hurting animals, killing animals, torturing insects. That book needs to go back to the nightmare it came from."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "High-seas piracy and the complex psychological lives of children are brought together, quite strikingly, in Richard Hughes\u2019s 1929 novel \"A High Wind in Jamaica.\" This book looks ahead to William Golding\u2019s \"Lord of the Flies\" in the way it suggests that the outward innocence of children may conceal a capacity for cruel and wicked acts; but Hughes\u2019s presentation of these ideas seems to work at a subtler and more disturbing level than does Golding\u2019s better-known 1954 novel.\"A High Wind in Jamaica\" begins in, unsurprisingly, Jamaica, at a time when that singularly lovely island is still an English colony. I took this book along with me on a trip to Jamaica, and I found that the descriptive passages from the early part of the book capture well the paradoxical beauty of the island: \u201cThe air was full of the usual tropic din: mosquitoes humming, cicalas trilling, bull-frogs twanging like guitars. That din goes on all night and all day almost: is more insistent, more memorable than the heat itself, even, or the number of things that bite\u201d (p. 18). The evocation of natural beauty, closing on a note of menace: it is strongly characteristic of the manner in which Hughes conveys setting and tells his story.The \u201chigh wind\u201d of the novel\u2019s title is a hurricane that strikes Jamaica and destroys the home of the Bas-Thorntons, an English family who, like many other Britons of that time, have come to Jamaica to recoup fortunes lost in the mother country. Struck by how narrowly the family survived the tempest that destroyed the family home, and concerned that their proper English children seem to be taking on \u201cwild\u201d island ways, Mr. and Mrs. Thornton decide that it is a propitious time to send their children to live in England, along with the children of a nearby Creole family.Yet Hughes\u2019s narrator places considerable emphasis on the idea that the Thorntons \u2013 and, by implication, most parents \u2013 know almost nothing about the actual emotional lives of their children, in passages like this one:\u201cIt would have surprised Mrs. Thornton very much to have been told that hitherto she had meant practically nothing to her children\u2026.[I]t would undoubtedly have surprised the children also to be told how little their parents meant to them. Children seldom have any power of quantitative self-analysis: whatever the facts, they believe as an article of faith that they love Father and Mother first and equally. Actually, the Thornton children had loved Tabby [the family cat] first and foremost in all the world, some of each other second, and hardly noticed their mother\u2019s existence more than once a week. Their father they loved a little more: partly owing to the ceremony of riding home on his stirrups.\u201d (pp. 44-45)But the Clorinda, the ship in which the Thorntons have booked passage \u201chome\u201d to England for their children, is waylaid by pirates; and once the children have been taken onto the pirate ship, Hughes gets on to his real subject: the question of what children \u2013 especially the two oldest Thornton children, John and Emily \u2013 are capable of, once the restraints of ordinary civilization have been stripped away.The children-and-pirates scenario may seem like something reminiscent of J.M. Barrie\u2019s \"Peter Pan\" (1904); but if anything, \"A High Wind in Jamaica\" works as a sort of anti-\"Peter Pan.\" For one thing, the pirates, as led by a Danish captain named Jonsen and his Viennese first mate Otto, are not figures of operatic menace, like Captain Hook from Peter Pan or Long John Silver from Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s \"Treasure Island\" (1883); rather, they emerge as feckless and rather pathetic figures. Taking advantage of the indulgent attitudes of Spanish colonial authorities in the port of Santa Lucia, Cuba, they are operating a good 150 years after the supposed \u201cgolden age\u201d of piracy: \u201cPiracy had long ceased to pay, and should have been scrapped years ago; but a vocational tradition will last on a long time after it has ceased to be economic, in a decadent form. Now, Santa Lucia \u2013 and piracy \u2013 continued to exist as they always had: but for no other reason\u201d (p. 96). And as their nautical misadventures unfold, Jonsen and Otto and the rest of the pirates show a remarkable capacity for poor and ill-informed decision-making. The more fateful, and more existentially troubling, words and actions and decisions come from the children.\"A High Wind in Jamaica\" offers a couple of real surprises. When, for example, one major character leaves the novel, the circumstances of said event are described so routinely \u2013 in a single, declarative, 24-word sentence, about one-third of the way through the book \u2013 that the reader is likely to flip through the next couple of pages in search of a passage saying \u201cIt was only a dream\u201d or \u201cIt was not as serious as had been expected\u201d; but no such passage is to be found. Comparably surprising is an action that Emily carries out after Captain Jonsen\u2019s pirate ship has captured a Dutch merchantman.Hughes is one of those early-20th-century British modernists whose literary consciousness seems to have been molded in large part by the devastation of the First World War. His narrator sets forth the events of \"A High Wind in Jamaica\" with a knowing, rueful outlook on human flaws and failings, occasionally moving from the novel\u2019s characteristic third-person omniscient point of view to passages of first-person narration in which the narrator stresses what he does not know \u2013 as when the narrator says of Mrs. Thornton that \u201cShe was a dumpy little woman \u2013 Cornish, I believe\u201d (p. 44).This work reminded me of the novels of Robert Graves and Malcolm Lowry, fellow Britons who lived and wrote during the same period; and if you like books like Graves\u2019s World War I memoir \"Good-Bye to All That\" (1929) or Lowry\u2019s novel \"Under the Volcano\" (1947), then \"A High Wind in Jamaica\" will probably appeal to you as well."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Welsh writer Richard Hughes published A High Wind in Jamaica in 1929 (sometimes published in the U.S. under the title The Innocent Voyage), and the playwright\u2019s novel would go on to be turned into a Broadway production by dramatist Paul Osborn in 1943.  The novel was also adapted for a 1965 movie of the same title that starred Anthony Quinn and James Coburn, and was performed as a radio play on two occasions (once in 1950 and then again in 2000).  To say the least, the novel has had a good run.Despite all of that, I was unfamiliar with the novel and its author until I heard Ann Patchett praise it at the San Antonio book festival a couple of weeks ago in a conversation she had there with author Elizabeth McCracken.  It is Patchett\u2019s theory that A High Wind in Jamaica has served as the blueprint for countless novels about children who are totally oblivious to the dangerous circumstances they may suddenly find themselves in.  She admits to more than once having used the pattern herself, including in her current novel, Commonwealth (a novel that turns out to be much more autobiographical than I would have imagined before hearing the author speak about it).A High Wind in Jamaica tells the story of a group of children being sent to England from Jamaica by their parents so that they can attend boarding schools in the mother country.  The children, all of them roughly between the ages of three and ten years old, are sent on their own \u2013 the youngest children being in the complete care of their older brothers and sisters.  Unfortunately, the rather lazy and negligent captain of the vessel on which they leave for England, allows his boat to be boarded and taken by a small group of the most incompetent \u201cpirates\u201d in the history of piracy.  The cowardly captain, in fact, makes a run for his own freedom, abandoning the children to the pirates who had temporarily moved the kids to their own little boat.  Now, the Danish pirate captain and his crew are stuck with a bunch of kids they have no idea what to do with \u2013 try as they might to figure it all out.To the kids, who never realize that their very lives are in jeopardy, it is all one big adventure and soon enough they are climbing ropes and getting into trouble at a pace that astounds even the roughest of the pirate crew.  The captain knows that he has to get rid of the children one way or the other if he is going to be able to avoid capture and prison \u2013 or worse \u2013 but no one wants to take them off his hands.Richard Hughes tries to take the reader inside the minds of the children and what they see from their distinctive points-of-view, his theory being that the minds of children do not work anything remotely like the minds of adults work.  This is a point that none of the adults in the story ever seem to figure out \u2013 and the repercussions stemming from this oversight are both comic and tragic.  In the end, the children who live through the prolonged \u201ckidnapping\u201d may be the least affected by what happened to them on the high seas around Cuba.Bottom Line: A High Wind in Jamaica is clever piece of satire that manages to be both a comedy and a tragedy.  It is easy to see why the short novel (191 pages) has been popular for so long, and if Ann Patchett\u2019s theory is correct, why it will remain a studied piece of writing for decades to come.  Despite its sometimes-tedious writing style, this one makes for an interesting read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great literature.
