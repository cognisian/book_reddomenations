This was a perfect summer read for me.  Not as challenging as some other books Ann Patchett has written, but we worth the time!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a wonderful book, filled with characters who are good people and who, like all good people, make mistakes. The observations about racism flow naturally from the narrative and make it possible to experience how it permeates our culture, and our neighborhoods. And what parents won't see ourselves in Doyle, who wants so much for his children, but just not what his children want for themselves? I've read this book twice and will read it again."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Another wonderful Ann Patchett novel. The characters were so well developed, and were so believable. I thought the motif of running/run was a clever thread that ran (literally) throughout the book. The interracial family at the center of the story was timely and a relevant twist. I loved this family! Do enjoy this beautiful read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Ann Patchett is a master story teller.

As the former mayor of Boston, Bernard Doyle wants to see his sons in politics, a dream the boys have never shared. But when an argument in a blinding New England snowstorm inadvertently causes an accident that involves a stranger and her child, all Bernard Doyle cares about is his ability to keep his children\u2014all his children\u2014safe.\r\n\r\nSet over a period of twenty-four hours, Run takes us from the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard to a home for retired Catholic priests in downtown Boston. It shows us how worlds of privilege and poverty can coexist only blocks apart from each other, and how family can include people you've never even met. As in her bestselling novel Bel Canto, Ann Patchett illustrates the humanity that connects disparate lives, weaving several stories into one surprising and endlessly moving narrative. Suspenseful and stunningly executed, Run is ultimately a novel about secrets, duty, responsibility, and the lengths we will go to protect our children.", "asin": "0061340642", "rank": "67158", "city": "Boston", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xLjWthJKL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
