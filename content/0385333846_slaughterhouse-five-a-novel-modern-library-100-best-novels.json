The novel is set in Germany, in upstate New York, and on the foreign planet of Tralfamadore, and the author continually draws the reader\u2019s attention to the fact that he or she is reading a book. With a peripheral first person narrator combined with third person omniscient perspective, authorial interjections, and a form and content that tangle around one another, the tale is experimental, absurd, and brilliant. An autobiography, a war drama, and science fiction, Slaughterhouse-Five is blunt, grim, ironic, and darkly humorous.Slaughterhouse-Five follows clownish Billy Pilgrim from optometry school to the Battle of the Bulge, where he is captured by the Germans and eventually transported to a POW camp in an abandoned slaughterhouse in Dresden. Billy Pilgrim\u2019s experience as a prisoner of war and survivor of the infamous, horrific, and long-classified firebombing of Dresden is an echo of that of the author\u2019s. Upon the war\u2019s end and liberation, Billy Pilgrim attempts to return to civilian life, marries, has a nervous breakdown, fathers two children, and survives both a plane crash and an alien abduction. The events of Pilgrim\u2019s life and experiences are told in an extreme non-linear fashion that jumps in time and is posited as all happening simultaneously. Time, as his alien captors inform him, is but an illusion:  separate, eternal, and happening in the same instance as every other moment.With equal eloquence and madness, Vonnegut presents a narrative that is stripped down to action. The story is stark and sparse with very little description and an utter lack of sympathy toward emotion. Even so, Vonnegut\u2019s most famous work is a heartrending glimpse into the mind of a man struggling to rebuild himself after the horrors of war. Free will is nonexistent, and people are continually trapped in life\u2014by government edicts, by chains, by family, by social expectation. The character of Billy Pilgrim is a witness to the pain and drudge and horror of life. Unable to face that futility and helplessness, he escapes into the world of science fiction.Slaughterhouse-Five is bitingly and unapologetically an anti-war novel, first published in 1969, when the public still felt the repercussions of WWII and were appalled by the war in Vietnam. The author himself was a man shaped and haunted by his experiences in war. Vonnegut posits that war is fought by fools and children and that righteous self-assurance and the arrogance of morality are dangerous and often spawns of war.There are no heroes in this story, and the villains are those who romanticize and glorify violence. Slaughterhouse-Five explores the injustice of suffering and how cruelty is a side effect of war. Helplessness, disconnection, and confusion abound. \u201cSo it goes.\u201d__________RecommendationHighly recommended for fans of postmodern, absurdist literature and for those interested in the artistic offshoots of WWII"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I enjoyed the novel just as much this time as when I first read it in the seventies. Kurt Vonnegut is the master of pairing the bizarre and the hilarious with the tragic and violent. It is difficult to imagine a more imaginative and dramatic way of depicting the fire-bombing of Dresden."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The cover is very thin and cheap looking, but looks ok"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It's a long-famed classic, but somehow I'd never picked Slaughterhouse Five up to read before - nor had I seen the movie. As one of those gaps in my reading, I was keen to see what the fuss was about, and a chance find of the paperback in a local shop sealed the deal.Slaughterhouse Five defies the usual structure of writing, following the story of Billy Pilgrim - and in part the author too - as he comes unstuck in time. While the author treads to tell the tale of the bombing of Dresden in World War Two, Pilgrim's story zigzags through time, sometimes finding himself on the fields of war, sometimes finding himself as a caged exhibit in a distant alien zoo, sometimes experiencing the mundane parts of his life as an optometrist. It's like the author has taken three decks of cards - one for each of those parts of Pilgrim's story - and riffle shuffled them into one stack.There's wry humour here alongside the horror of the war as Pilgrim meets all kinds of people, many of whom are not long for this world, and each death in the book capped off with the words \"So it goes\". It's remarkable how laconic the narrative is as it deals with such nightmares, but it still hits home.I'm not sure what expectations I had when I picked this book up - but it certainly exceeded them. I might have wished for more in the alien aspects of the story, as they in some ways feel rather whimsical and not explored as much as they could be, but that's a minor complaint. It's a smashing book, and one that opens your eyes to the realities of war in ways you might not anticipate."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "For anyone who needs a new outlook on life, this is the book for you.

I started Slaughter House Five right after The Things They Carried. Both books have such a great dead panned view of the absurdity and inhumanity of war.
