The animals in this book were all real characters. They lived the lives depicted here, and showed the stamp of heroism and personality more strongly by far than it has been in the power of my pen to tell. Natural history has lost much by the vague general treatment that is so common. What satisfaction would be derived from a ten-page sketch of the habits and customs of Man? How much more profitable it would be to devote that space to the life of some one great man. This is the principle I have endeavored to apply to my animals. \r\n\r\nThe real personality of the individual, and his view of life are my theme, rather than the ways of the race in general, as viewed by a casual and hostile human eye.", "asin": "1466233249", "rank": "582268", "city": "Toronto", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51B7Qe-QOeL.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
