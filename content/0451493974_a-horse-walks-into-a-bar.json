And he steps on stage to give a performance of a lifetime, at a club in a small industrial-type town in Israel. It will be a performance no one expects, especially not the man Dovaleh has invited, almost begged to attend, a man he hasn\u2019t seen in more than 40 years, when they were both young teens.He takes the stage. He tells jokes. He tells stories. He insults the audience. He insults individual members of the audience. He goes off on wild tangents. If you\u2019re in the audience, you might think your entertainment has been hijacked. If you\u2019re the reader of \u201cA Horse Walks into a Bar\u201d by David Grossman (translated from the Hebrew by Jessica Cohen), you wonder if you\u2019re going to be able to stand the comedy and the anger and the almost-manic monologues that seem to go on and on.But, like the audience, you hang in there, the audience perhaps because it likes to be insulted, as long as it\u2019s funny and entertaining (look, this guy even makes jokes about the Holocaust). The reader plods ahead, knowing that this novel won the 2017 Man Booker International Award and there must be a reason or reasons why it did, and knowing that Grossman has published a wide array of acclaimed fiction and non-fiction works.Members of the audience begin to leave. Some stay. Some readers may quit. But if you continue, you begin to understand what is happening in this story, and what a truly extraordinary story it is. It\u2019s going to smack you upside the head.The pivotal player is not the man on the stage. No, that role belongs to the man invited to attend, Avishai Lazar, a retired judge. Still grieving the loss of his wife, he can\u2019t quite believe he agreed to come. Several times he almost walks out. After all, he barely knew Dovaleh. And the last time he had seen him was when they were 13 and attending an Israeli Army camp for young people. Dovaleh had had to leave early, and no one, including Avishai, knew why. And that will become the point on which the story hinges.You might, like I did, spend the first 40 to 50 pages telling yourself there must be something better to read, that you don\u2019t really see where this story is going, and you\u2019re getting put off by the constant stream of anger and insults, no matter how many jokes are mixed in. But then something happens, there is a shift that begins subtly and then builds, and you discover you\u2019re captivated. Because it happens on stage, Grossman has written what is strikingly like a play, a play that gradually becomes mesmerizing.\u201cA Horse Walks into a Bar\u201d will unlike anything you\u2019ve read before. And if you persist, you will understand why it won the Man Booker award."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A brilliant Goldsmith digs down deep into the human psyche to describe the challenges of being human, and the complexity of living in Israel. Fully drawn characters, intimate relationships, humor, and heartbreaking reflection. Masterful usage of storytelling viewed through the eyes of a retired judge about a stand-up comic revealing his soul, tragically, for probably the final time."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a riveting quick read.

David Grossman\u2019s Dovelah walks on his hands and on every page I marveled at how the author pulled me into this dreary nightclub in Netanya, Israel.  It took me a while to figure out why Netanya and not Jerusalem or Tel Aviv and my best guess is that Netanya is both everywhere and nowhere.If you read this book imagine who you are in the audience.  Are you the Judge or the Dwarf or will you walk out before Dov finishes his act.This book depressed me, inspired me and for sure made me laugh out loud.  There was this parrot..... you\u2019ll have to read the book for the punch line and the humanity in this 194 page tour de force performance."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Not at all interesting.

In the dance between comic and audience, with barbs flying back and forth, a deeper story begins to take shape\u2014one that will alter the lives of many of those in attendance.\r\n\r\nIn a little dive in a small Israeli city, Dov Greenstein, a comedian a bit past his prime, is doing a night of stand-up. In the audience is a district court justice, Avishai Lazar, whom Dov knew as a boy, along with a few others who remember Dov as an awkward, scrawny kid who walked on his hands to confound the neighborhood bullies. Gradually, as it teeters between hilarity and hysteria, Dov\u2019s patter becomes a kind of memoir, taking us back into the terrors of his childhood: we meet his beautiful flower of a mother, a Holocaust survivor in need of constant monitoring, and his punishing father, a striver who had little understanding of his creative son. Finally, recalling his week at a military camp for youth\u2014where Lazar witnessed what would become the central event of Dov\u2019s childhood\u2014Dov describes the indescribable while Lazar wrestles with his own part in the comedian\u2019s story of loss and survival. Continuing his investigations into how people confront life\u2019s capricious battering, and how art may blossom from it, Grossman delivers a stunning performance in this memorable one-night engagement (jokes in questionable taste included).\r\n\r\n\u201cDavid Grossman has attempted an ambitious high-wire act of a novel, and he\u2019s pulled it off spectacularly. A Horse Walks into a Bar shines a spotlight on the effects of grief, without any hint of sentimentality. The central character is challenging and flawed, but completely compelling. We were bowled over by Grossman\u2019s willingness to take emotional as well as stylistic risks: every sentence counts, every word matters in this supreme example of the writer\u2019s craft.\u201d Man Booker International Prize, 2017", "asin": "0451493974", "rank": "24353", "city": "Tel Aviv", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61lbRC%2ByXcL.jpg", "country": "Israel", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
