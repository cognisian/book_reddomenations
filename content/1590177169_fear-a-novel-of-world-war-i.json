Dartemont is a social rebel who is against the war and the near religious fervor of nationalism and its follies. Early on he describes the euphoria the citizenry exhibit at the announcement they are going to war. Police beat people for \"not displaying sufficent enthusiasm.\" In the battlefields, he experiences indescribable horrors. These are some of the most gruesome yet artistically written passages of death I've come upon. Back home, no one wants to hear of the realities. They just want to hear the good parts, the killing of the Boche, the glory and valor, acts of heroism. Dartemont is turned off by the wanton self-delusional behavior of those around him. The Sheep.

This was( and still is) a preserved part of the trenches right next to the river Yser near the Flemish town of Diksmuide where the Allies faced the Germans for 4 long and miserable years. Even as a kid I didn't need much imagination to get an inkling of the horror that took place there a mere 50 years before. That part of Flanders is always windswept , and even in summer , in those flatlands near the river , you feel a chill. Since then I've read Celine's traumatic war experiences in  \"Journey to the End of the Night\" , \"Nothing New from the Western Front \" by Erich Maria Remarque , and Junger's \"Storm of Steel\" amongst others, but nothing shows you the daily horror, the blood and the gore, the fear, the weeping, the unending suffering of the common soldier as Gabriel Chevalier's masterpiece does. You will find no heroism in here, at least not the heroism that is State-sponsored and political, but you will find the true heroism of the simple soldier trying to make it through another day and mindful and protective of the guy right next to him .This must read book transported me back to that day of my youth when I stood, uncomprehendingly, at the hand of my father in those not-high-enough trenches and imagined the bullets and bombs in search of their victims."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The book is in prime condition completely happy with it"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Simply an amazing novel about World War I.
