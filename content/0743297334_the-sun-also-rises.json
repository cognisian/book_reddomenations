James.Like the novel Moby Dick, The Sun Also Rises is marred by featuring mistreatment of animals that today we find distasteful.  The alcoholism is unpretty.  The nasty remarks and objectification of Jews is representative of the vulgarity of the characters (not Hemingway).  Again, unpretty and much more than unpretty considering what was to happen to my people in only a few more years.I think that the impact of the novel, as with so many others of the times, is weakened by the necessity of writing within the censorship and obscenity rules of the times.  It makes it seem unrealistic to contemporary ears\u2014young people don\u2019t talk in such sanitized ways.I don\u2019t like bull fighting (I\u2019ve been to a bull fight in Mexico).  I think getting drunk is vulgar.  Ugly remarks about Jews are common in great literature but always seem petty and out of place to our ears now.I know this is a well-loved novel, but not by me."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I haven\u2019t got it yet.

This first of his works was saved for the last because it received so much praise. I conclude that if you've read one of his works you can stop there. If this work left out the repetitive drinking episodes the 251 pages could have been pared in half. Maybe that's why the drinking scenes were not pared down...there was essentially no plot to speak of otherwise. As I read this work, the famous Seinfeld episode kept popping into my head where George and Jerry met with TV producers and told them their show was about nothing. I'm glad I got it from the library. This is a book about nothing. Oh there is one line stolen by Dr. Suess on page 84 Mike said to Brett \" where did you get that hat?\"  \"Chap bought it for me, do you like it?\" \"It's a dreadful hat, do get a good hat\"."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Easy read.

In that sense it is superb.But it helps to know--one needs to know-- that this is more a journal or stream-of-consciousness thought than a novel. The characters are interesting and the scenes are captivating, but, as a story, as a book, it goes nowhere.  No real plot, just a telling of some of Hemingway's interesting experiences.Still, it's Hemingway.  That alone makes it worth reading."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The Sun Also Rises has some of the best character development of any book that I have ever read. In many ways, this is the de facto standard of how an author should bring the reader into the the mindset of what the character is all about. Ernest Hemingway writes a fantastic stunted love story between two people who can never be in love. I think what I liked about it most was the struggle. I knew it would never work between them, but I still wanted them to try to make it work.This book was st in the 1920's and this made it a bit hard to relate to, but I still enjoyed it.
