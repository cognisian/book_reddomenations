Hijuelos has created and brought to life two beloved characters, a heart-stealing heroine and Havana during an epoch of changing fate.\" Amy Tan, bestselling author of The Joy Luck Club\r\n\r\nIn Beautiful Mar\u00eda of My Soul, Oscar Hijuelos returns to the passionate tale he began twenty years ago in The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love.\r\n\r\nMar\u00eda is the great Cuban beauty who stole musician Nestor Castillo's heart and broke it, inspiring him to write the Mambo Kings' biggest hit, \"Beautiful Mar\u00eda of My Soul.'\" Now in her sixties and living as an exile in Miami, Mar\u00eda remains a beauty, still capable of turning heads. But while she left Cuba decades ago, she has never forgotten Nestor. As she thinks back to her days--and nights--in Havana, an entirely new perspective on the Mambo Kings story unfolds. Beautiful Mar\u00eda of My Soul is a stunning act of reinvention, and another contemporary classic from an extraordinarily talented writer.\r\n\r\n\"Savor the mysterious power of a master's pentimento.\" Los Angeles Times", "asin": "1401310516", "rank": "1388390", "city": "Miami", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51TzkVdTHSL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
