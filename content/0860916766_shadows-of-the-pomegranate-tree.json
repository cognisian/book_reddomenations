The book rambled on and on and never held my interest.  This was never a book that I eagerly wanted to pick up and read so that I could see what was going to come next.  I only read the first 50 pages and could never figure how the author won any awards with this type of writing.  This is a book that I definitely will not be passing on to a friend.  I do not recommend this book."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This was not an easy read. I found the many similar names confusing, due to my own ignorance of the Arabic language.
