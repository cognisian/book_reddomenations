Alencar was nothing if not prolific, he wrote dozens of novels, plays, and poetry, and worked as a journalist and politician.  \"Senhora\" is interesting because it came out during a period when so little serious fiction featured strong women as protagonists.  Aurelia, the title character, is a beautiful young woman who comes into a huge inheritance in 19th-century Rio de Janeiro and overturns social conventions by buying the husband of her choice.  So the story's real depth and primary point of discussion revolves around Brazil's upper class norms, women's social roles, and the power of wealth.  It is interesting in this regard.  Alencar's Romanticism is rooted in a sort of pre-revolutionary distaste (if not disgust) for established social conventions.  He was a wealthy intellectual criticizing his own milieu.Perhaps his descriptions of wealth --pages dedicated to the delicate inlays in a single piece of furniture or the passion of a waltz-- are overwrought, and may strike some readers as being born of Alencar's lust for upper class pursuits, rather than of any detached criticism of them.  Readers must be prepared for these careful descriptions of wealthy follies, for by modern standards very little happens in the story.  Alencar was a Romanticist, meaning that he cultivated in his writing elements of anti-classicism, of free-form emotion, and of descriptions of settings rather than tracing the chronology of a plot.  This is a story driven on one level by its complicated prose and on another by its social criticism and the depth of its characters.  Modern readers looking for plot and action may not have the patience for this book, and may also find the ending (called a \"surprising twist\" by some critics) to be a bit of a cop-out.  It's as though Alencar didn't want to write any longer or didn't want to disappoint what he imagined to be a primarily female audience thirsting for romantic closure."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A read this book a long time ago, in high school, and enjoyed it very much. For those of you who know nothing about brazilian literature, here goes a little profile about the author: \"JOS\u00c9 MARTINIANO DE ALENCAR  was born in Mecejana, Cear\u00e1, on 1 May, 1829, and died in Rio de Janeiro on  12 December, 1877. He studied law in S\u00e3o Paulo and Olinda, and then threw  himself into the journalistic world of Rio de Janeiro. He later entered  politics becoming a deputy and eventually Minister of Justice. The refusal  of the Emperor, however, to accept his nominatiou as senator caused him to  retire from public life. One of the most prolific of Brazilian writers,  Jos\u00e9 de Alencar was at the same time journalist, novelist, dramatist and  poet. He was widely read in French literature, and romantic writers such as  Dumas, Chateaubriand and Hugo had a profound influence on him. To the  romantic mood of the day he added a fervent patriotism, which found its  ideal subject in the history of his conntry, and especially in the life and  legends of the Brazilian Indian, whose champion he became (c. f. Gon\u00e7alves  Dias in poetry). His interest ranged the whole length and breadth of  Brazil, and there are few regions of that vast country which did not  provide subjectmatter for his pen. He practically created the Brazilian  historical novel, and achieved wide popularity with the publication of such  works as O Guarani (Rio, 1857); As Minas de Prata (Rio, 1862); and Iracema  (Rio, 1865). The exuberance of his frankly avowed romanticism and a  pompous, declamatory style are now very foreign to our modem taste, but his  gifts as a story-teller and his patriotic spirit will always ensure him a  place among Brazil's most popular writers. Other major works: O Ga\u00facho  (Rio, 1870); O Tronco do Ip\u00ea (Rio, 1871); Ubirajara (Rio, 1874); Senhora  (Rio, 1875).\""}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book is amazing!
