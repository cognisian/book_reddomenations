I didn't know a thing about Venice, and the author communicated his love of the city to me through this book.  I like that he used primary documents.

I recommend it highly."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A succinct, vividly-written, and sweeping history of the city on the lagoon, and, moreover, of the Most Serene Republic of Venice that dominated Mediterranean trade for centuries. It's a new history, more compact than the magisterial history of Venice by John Julius Norwich, but goes further by telling the history of Venice from the fall of the Republic in 1798 to Bonaparte, and brings it up to the present day. This book also tells us of the city's contributions to art, literature, cinema and the Grand Tour -- indeed, its long relationship to world tourism from 1700 on. It's eye-opening in its story, not just of a beautiful city, but of the Most Serene Republic that built it over a milennium, and its unique and separate identity: in a medieval Italy fraught with intramural and dynastic strife, the Republic was remarkably stable and worldly. Highest recommendation."}]}, "authors": ["Thomas F.

Its breathtaking architecture, art, and opera ensure that Venice remains a perennially popular destination for tourists and armchair travelers alike. Yet most of the available books about this magical city are either facile travel guides or fusty academic tomes. In Venice, renowned historian Thomas F. Madden draws on new research to explore the city\u2019s many astonishing achievements and to set 1,500 years of Venetian history and the endless Venetian-led Crusades in the context of the ever-shifting Eurasian world. \r\n\r\nFilled with compelling insights and famous figures, Venice is a monumental work of popular history that\u2019s as opulent and entertaining as the great city itself.\r\n\r\n\"Breezy, cheerful, evenhanded, Madden debunks myths about Venetian decadence, and brushes aside ugly whispers about greedy, unscrupulous merchants.  When a colorful character pops up (Marco Polo, Casanova), he makes the most of it in his brisk, no-nonsense prose.\" New York Times", "asin": "0147509807", "rank": "90929", "city": "Venice", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sIgnTEb2L.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
