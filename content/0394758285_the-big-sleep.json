If you have really been through the wringer with all of \"today's\" books and want to take yourself back to a simpler, better, more defined time, then \"The Big Sleep\" is a very good novel with which to begin.  It is not long and reads very quickly.  For all of us who have always wondered where the parodies and satires and even serious depictions of private eyes have come from, this is where it all started."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The master at work."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent novel"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Raymond Chandler is a master at evoking setting and character with sharp, powerful prose.  He should be read by every reader who appreciates the genre of detective fiction, and studied by every serious writer, no matter the genre. His private eye, Philip Marlowe, is iconic, but his treatment of women leaves much to be desired.  Just keep in mind, he's a product of his era (The Thirties)."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "a classic that doesnt dissapoint. named my cat marlowe."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I love the Bogart/Bacall screen version, but the novel has a complete (though challenging) plot. In the book, you\u2019ll finally find out what happened to \u201cShawn\u201d (Rusty) Regan, Bacall\u2019s husband. Little sister, Carmen, has a much more dominant role, and Geiger\u2019s backstory business is much steamier than hinted at in the film.When Marlowe finally meets \u201cMrs. Eddie Mars,\u201d Carmen\u2019s sister (Bacall) isn\u2019t there ... and the dynamic is much more suspenseful. Although I love THE BIG SLEEP, I actually think that two of Chandler\u2019s less popular works are his triumphs: THE HIGH WINDOW and PLAYBACK.In short, even if you\u2019ve seen the 1940s film adaptation dozens of times and have memorized the plot, you will find THE BIG SLEEP a very satisfying read."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "The book is great!
