To me, his sentences went on and on and on--paragraphs were entire pages long. When he started writing about feces, I was almost ready to put the book down.

A twisted cast of manipulators or, the merciless dominators who force the antics of the manipulators. Misery is displayed in nauseating detail then wrapped up neatly and presented at the end as caused by the evil of traditional mid-century American values. The misery can only be cured by getting what you want, whether you have to sell your soul or not is immaterial. (Gary)The story follows, for 566 pages, a bunch of sad secretive members of ta family who don't understand why they are unhappy or how to plan their lives to make themselves happy. There is an astonishing lack of self-awareness, and no notion of how to forgive themselves for their own failings, or forgive others for not being who they want them to be. It is a world of a teenager who longs to be in charge, but has no conception of cause and effect or discipline. The most juvenile of delusions is that when you can finally do whatever you want, you'll get to be happy.The book does not try to disprove that and is an exercise in futility. Unless you like long meandering tales where everyone is less than they should be and events are meaningless, because the characters learn nothing. Except perhaps Chip. But we don't really know because we are given no details about his resolution at the end of the story, or what he thinks about it.If this is how the author sees the world, I think he feels like these characters: at sea in a hostile world where nothing makes sense, awash in silent misery and selfishly protecting himself against all comers. And I can kind of feel sorry for him."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of the best books I've read!

Everyone is so horrible.  The failures just don't end. But the writing is so brilliant that it lures you in to each story and I found myself desperate to pick the book up every chance I could once I got about half way through. I cried like a baby at the end without fully understanding why.
