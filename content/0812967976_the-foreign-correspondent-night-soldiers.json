Like a fine wine, there is no rush to immediately consume all the earlier work, so on this beautiful fall week in the White Mountains of Arizona, I was able to enjoy his 2006 \u201cThe Foreign Correspondent\u201d.His espionage novels excel in the tense days of the late 1930s before the world is consumed in war. When reading this historical fiction, the visualization is in black & white and the reader is transported in time, in this case, to Paris, a city that many Furst readers know well.Paris is full of immigrants, and including many Italians who did not want to live under Mussolini. The story centers on Carlo Weisz, a correspondent that no longer can conduct his trade in Italy and he is fortunate to become a foreign correspondent for the Paris bureau of Reuters. He covers the Spanish civil war, as well as the closing days in Berlin just prior to Hitler\u2019s march to conquer Europe, as well as news stories throughout France.Besides his Reuters position, Carlos becomes the editor of Liberazione, an anti-fascist newspaper that is smuggled and distributed in Italy. Mussolini\u2019s secret police, the OVRA, are in Paris conducting their own espionage to learn who is behind that publication, so that it can be stopped. Before long Carlos is involved in a triangle between OVRA, the French Surete, and the British MI6. There is never a dull day and most days certainly contain an element of danger.As in all Alan Furst novels, there is romance between the lead character and a beautiful woman, which always adds a little more sizzle to the story."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Anti-Fascist Italians in prewar France, Hitler resistance, the Spanish Civil War, and the start of WWII.

The only shortcoming was that the ending was pretty abrupt, and not entirely satisfying (don't worry Mr Furst; I am the last person who would spoil the ending). I am currently on a project to read all of Mr. Furst's novels, so that, in and of itself, is a recommendation of sorts, no?."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Really enjoyed this book.

It is an inspiring, thrilling saga of everyday people forced by their hearts\u2019 passion to fight in the war against tyranny.\r\n\r\nBy 1938, hundreds of Italian intellectuals, lawyers and journalists, university professors and scientists had escaped Mussolini\u2019s fascist government and taken refuge in Paris. There, amid the struggles of \u00e9migr\u00e9 life, they founded an Italian resistance, with an underground press that smuggled news and encouragement back to Italy. Fighting fascism with typewriters, they produced 512 clandestine newspapers. The Foreign Correspondent is their story.\r\n\r\nParis, a winter night in 1938: a murder/suicide at a discreet lovers\u2019 hotel. But this is no romantic traged\u2013it is the work of the OVRA, Mussolini\u2019s fascist secret police, and is meant to eliminate the editor of Liberazione, a clandestine \u00e9migr\u00e9 newspaper. Carlo Weisz, who has fled from Trieste and secured a job as a foreign correspondent with the Reuters bureau, becomes the new editor. \r\n\r\nWeisz is, at that moment, in Spain, reporting on the last campaign of the Spanish civil war. But as soon as he returns to Paris, he is pursued by the French S\u00fbret\u00e9, by agents of the OVRA, and by officers of the British Secret Intelligence Service. In the desperate politics of Europe on the edge of war, a foreign correspondent is a pawn, worth surveillance, or blackmail, or murder. \r\n\r\nThe Foreign Correspondent is the story of Carlo Weisz and a handful of antifascists: the army officer known as \u201cColonel Ferrara,\u201d who fights for a lost cause in Spain; Arturo Salamone, the shrewd leader of a resistance group in Paris; and Christa von Schirren, the woman who becomes the love of Weisz\u2019s life, herself involved in a doomed resistance underground in Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Correspondent is Alan Furst at his absolute best\u2013taut and powerful, enigmatic and romantic, with sharp, seductive writing that takes the reader through darkness and intrigue to a spectacular denouement.\r\n", "asin": "0812967976", "rank": "327355", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QR1hhxZIL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
