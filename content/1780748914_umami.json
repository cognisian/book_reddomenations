An extremely charming novel that seamlessly toggles between a couple of years in the lives of the people who inhabit a Mexico City tenement compound. Particularly wonderful are the amaranth scholar who sets out to reconstruct his beloved wife through writing after she dies of pancreatic cancer and Luz, the five-year-old girl who drowns shortly after her narration ends (as we learn from her sister Ana\u2014a lovely character, as well\u2014in the book\u2019s opening pages). Jufresa\u2019s disarming, unabashed tone and interest in the intersection of languages and cultures reminded me of Chloe Aridjis\u2019 wonderful Book of Clouds, while Sophie Hughes\u2019 translation stands alongside the original as a dazzling feat in its own right. Hughes won the English PEN Award for this translation, and I can certainly see why, as the English abounds with inventive and delightful solutions to the challenges of the Spanish.A beautiful and surprising meditation on community, absent maternity and growth of all kinds."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I started reading this book about a month ago and read it off and on in my spare time. It was not a book that you wanted to finish in one sitting, but I enjoyed getting to know the characters and learning about Spanish culture. I like the idea that people are complex and whether alive or dead, we think about them and reflect on why they did what they did. Sometimes it makes sense and sometimes we will never understand, but that's okay, these memories keep them alive, and make life more bearable after they're gone."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Admirable effort.

Found it to be a great read. Extremely well crafted with lots of subtleties, ironies, joy and sorrow."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "A melancholy but impressive collection of thoughts on life, death and relationships. Jufresa leaves some of the heavy lifting to her readers and I enjoyed the attention required to attend to the story and to attempt to differentiate the voices of each narrator. However, I had a difficult time actually hearing those different voices, the characters often feeling quite similar. The result was a feeling of uncertainty about who was speaking and I wondered at times if the same purpose couldn't have been accomplished with fewer narrators.Of the novel's many narrators, I most enjoyed the thoughts of the retired professor, a widower whose narration mostly related to his deceased wife and the time they had spent together. His musings on time, love and purpose were at times quite profound. What never quite worked for me was the tying in of the umami theme with the overall story and characters. A good novel for pondering some of life's important questions, but the lack of differentiation between the several voices felt like a significant weakness.Note: ARC received free from publisher"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Stream of consciousness best describes my opinion.
