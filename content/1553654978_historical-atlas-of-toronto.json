For instance, the drab background, presumably imitating parchment colour, succeeds mainly in being . . . drab.In that sense, this book does not compare in quality with the Historical Atlas of New York City.Nevertheless, this book is recommended to anyone interested in the history of Toronto's development."}]}, "authors": ["Derek Hayes"], "isbn": "1553654978", "longitude": -79.387207, "periods": ["1700s", "1800s", "1900s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "Historical Atlas of Toronto", "word_cloud": "work present urban history beginning settlement century numerous map illustration great publish wonder barely update older little developed recent age computer graphic extremely conservative instance drab background presumably imitate parchment color succeed mainly sense compare quality recommend anyone interested history development", "genres": ["History"], "summary": "Renowned map historian Derek Hayes provides a unique perspective on Toronto's colourful past.\r\n\r\nIn just two centuries, Toronto has grown from a tiny outpost of the British Empire to a world-class city, by far the largest in Canada.
