It brought me back to the alleys, canals and piazzas of Venice."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This world classic of travel writing is a must in any scholarly library. In Venice Morris practically defines modern travel writing.  In my opinion one of the worlds top writers without need to include the term \"travel\".  Sadly Harcourt Press have done us the readers and Morris a serious disfavour in the way they printed this classic.  So tight are the lines, so poorly printed is the text and so unbelievable awful are the photo reproductions I can hardly say.  I own many Morris books both paper and hardback but none are so badly printed as this.  Harcourt seems to take pride in printing Venice on the cheapest paper, with the worst font available.  It is a absolute eye sore to read given the thin spacing of the text.  Do yourself a favour and DON'T BUY THIS EDITION.  Look for the UK version or any other publisher than Harcourt.  An extremely sad result given the importance of this book on travel writing world wide."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Book arrived quickly and in \"new\" condition.
