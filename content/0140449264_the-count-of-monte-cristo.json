It was somewhat enjoyable, although the lead character had a God complex.  The leading character, the count, liked to be generous and he saved a nubian man from death and in return the man became his faithful servant, yet the \"benevolent\" count described him to another servant as a slave and lowlier than a dog and worthy of instant death if he should not serve the count properly.  Very distasteful, unapologetic racism it was, and the count seemed to be desperate to keep the servant's service who he was discussing that with, I don't know why.  Also, his relationship with the slave woman Haidee was negligible.  I'm certain he alluded to having relations with her when he first mentioned her but he called her his daughter later, and then sought romance with her.  In the end he didn't actually kill anyone with his own hand, even though he sought revenge, and he helped a young couple in love and he told the truth finally, but he was somewhat nuts.  The book was not exactly what I expected and quite long and written in an older style and could have been better without that one major flawed line, and his God complex (obviously called Monte CRISTO for a reason, but it was strange) and the revenge."}]}, "authors": ["Alexandre Dumas p\u00e8re"], "isbn": "0140449264", "longitude": 2.3514992, "periods": ["1800s"], "title": "The Count of Monte Cristo", "word_cloud": "small print so much better movie adaptation ever keep enthral story cause many sleepless night become engross story page quite sure first endear love first time a story revenge realize disguise enough run internal torment revenge world bring true peace happiness first time read unabridged version shock learn year copy often abridge oh much left still favorite take long time end felt know character personally prove hie satisfy see scoundrel get comeuppance choosy classic terribly dull philosophical pointless excellent got action adventure romance drama love very well write classical excellent deeply classic literature chapter vivid poetically write minor typo easy enough follow like reference point book thing author mentioned common good hard get first drama set go smoothly somewhat enjoyable lead character complex lead character like generous saved nubian man death return man become faithful servant yet benevolent describe servant slave lowlier dog worthy instant death serve properly very distasteful unapologetic racism seem desperate keep servant service discuss know also relationship slave woman negligible certain allude relation first mention call daughter later seek romance end actually anyone hand even sought revenge help young couple love tell truth finally somewhat nut exactly expect quite long write older style major flaw line complex obviously call reason strange revenge", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature"], "summary": "\"On what slender threads do life and fortune hang\"\r\n\r\nThrown in prison for a crime he has not committed, Edmond Dantes is confined to the grim fortress of If.
