A few readers really liked this book, saying that it was absolutely terrific, but most of us were less convinced. The general consensus was that it was too long with too little happening.Crain is a respected literary critic, so he really knows how to write. We were constantly presented with great descriptive and unexpected images, especially with the protagonist Jacob's every internal thought carefully cataloged and nuanced change explored. But after a while, it's just too much. Too too much.I was impressed that the novel begins on the day that Jacob enters the teacher's lounge in Prague where he will be teaching English and ends on the day that he gets on the bus to leave Prague to return to America. The time is 1990 just after the Communist government has fallen and capitalism is painfully trying to take hold.There aren't a lot of flashbacks or backstories in the novel. Jacob did have one unsatisfying relationship in America and he's come to Prague to come out as gay among strangers, which he slowly and unevenly does. Many of the readers found Jacob to be charmless and too naive, which isn't a reason to dislike the novel but it makes it difficult to maintain much interest in his goings-on. As for his goings-on, not much happens. Jacob and his fellow teachers teach class, go out drinking, visit historic sites and museums, view beautiful architectural sites around the city and nearby, drink more, deal with the landlord, get ill and get better, talk about life a lot, gain a few outside jobs teaching English, and try to connect with each other and the locals. This is all standard college stuff, demonstrating how people easily move into your life and just as easily slide out. After all, they're all young and anything is possible.The novel has three sections. In the first section, Jacob has a rather low-key affair with a local guy, Lubos, who turns out to have secrets that Jacob cannot deal with. The second section revolves around Carl, Jacob's friend from college who comes to visit and begins a relationship with one of Jacob's fellow teachers. The final section finds Jacob in a rather satisfying relationship with another local, Milo, who he introduces to his teacher-friends as he prepares to leave Prague. But despite the two significant affairs, there is absolutely no sex in this book. It's what Edmund White and Paul Monette refer to as \"d*ckless fiction,\" which sometimes means the author is hoping for a cross-over hit.One of our readers was impressed at how gray Prague was presented in writing. Somehow, all the details reduce it all to a gray movie. The novel is very even; there's no crescendo in action, no major event, no glorious soaring moment, no one has an epiphany. Even the one death in the novel takes place far off stage and far, far away. There's not enough in the characterizations or in the politics to make a serious dent.I'm going to stick with my original assessment that \"Necessary Errors\" is well written, just not exciting or very entertaining. The problem is that the novel reflects the action it presents too well. There's not enough to make it interesting or recommendable outside academics interested in good writing or people who've visited Prague."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It is a good story of an American teaching in the Czech Republic immediately after the fall of communism. But also an excellent source of information about life in the Republic following the transition. For those who want to be writers, this is an excellent, though long, novel that provides the best of current non-fiction fiction autobiographical writing."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A lot of the bad reviews of this book have been from people who immediately latched on the the book's Czechoslovakian setting and expected a light narrative about the character's time there. That really isn't what this is about and that is what made me adore this book more than anything.I agree with many reviewers in that Crain is attempting instead to explore the every day interactions with others and the city itself. His absolute mastery of dialogue has created a sort of character study; we as readers are never told how to feel about a character or an event, we are simply guided through it, free to get to know the characters on our own. The critics on the back cover are entirely correct, I believe, in saying that 'Necessary Errors' is indeed a masterpiece. If you're looking for something that tries hard and overtly to connect with you and your own previous experiences, this is not the book you should read. If instead, you're looking for a work of literary art that challenges both itself and you as the reader, a novel that will absolutely invite you, despite anything you're bringing to the table, into its world with fantastic subtlety, then PLEASE read this novel.You will not regret it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Caleb, I just read your Harper's article about literature in the age of algorithms.

Many of the last 100 pages left me thinking 'nobody should be allowed to write this good',  and hurriedly copying passages to my quote book (I know)."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "If you migrated `east` after the fall of the `iron curtain,` then Caleb Crain`s `Necessary Errors` is a necessary read.  Even for those who stayed home, `Errors` shouldn`t be missed.  Like some 19th century novelist, Caleb Crain has created a rich universe that holds much mystery and treasure for all 472 pages.`Necessary Errors` is a love story (or rather several), a coming-of-age saga, and most of all, a bildungsroman of a young gay man finding himself abroad.  Texas-born, Harvard graduate, Jacob Putnam has found himself floating in Prague on the waves of post-revolution euphoria.  He has just come out and like his adopted Praguers, is tasting the delights (and limits) of a new-found freedom.  Finding work as the ubiquitous `language teacher, ` he joins a group of similarly idealistic and unmoored ex-pats living the heady atmosphere of 1990`s Praha.  There`s Annie, a flame-locked Irish lass who becomes Jacob`s closest confidante, the handsome and straight Scot, Thom, the cerebral and eccentric Englishman, Henry, and the pretty `English rose,` Melinda, whose movie star looks and imperial bearing make her pack-leader.And there are others, Germans, like pallid Kaspar obsessed with Czech poetry and Prague`s Jewish past and Danes like the embittered socialist, Hans, who mourns the demise of socialism.  And of course, there are the the Czechs themselves.  The Stehliks, Jacob`s courteous but suspicious landlords, struggle to understand why Jacob left the land of plenty.  Then there are the boyfriends, Lubos and Milo.  And even another American, Carl, Jacob`s friend from the States, joins the pack of comrades in hopes of experiencing `it` before `it` moves on.With its colorful cast of characters, `Errors` reads like a Dickens` novel.  Crain artfully captures the tension and euphoria of being young and footloose abroad, stumbling from one life experience to another.  Jacob and pals connect in dingy classrooms, smoky `lokals, ` smokier coffeehouses, deafening discos and of course, down sooty alleys at four in the morning.  This novel celebrates that unbearable lightness of being that disappears as fast as you live it.Despite its voluminous size, `Errors` reads fast.  It is mostly dialogue, as the characters question themselves and tackle the big questions of life, love and the future.  And all this against the backdrop of a city and society born anew.  These conversations saunter along effortlessly, as if you the reader were eavesdropping along.  Crain masterfully integrates Jacob`s blossoming proficiency with Czech.  Meaning is gracefully hinted at rather than directly translated.\u201cRekni ti to pozdej,\u201d said Jacob.\u201cNo, don`t tell him later either.  That`s no better,\u201d snapped Annie.As some reviewers have correctly pointed out, no grand action or profound change occurs within these 472 pages.  No dramatic courting, no scenes of relationships gone awry, no marriages, deaths, tragic things whatsoever.  Rather, this novel is an exploration of identities, what it means to be young, American, a `westerner, gay, and most of all, what it means to stand before those `big` events in life that determine destiny.  Even sex is treated in a minor, almost superfluous manner.  `Errors` is a novel of intentions, dreams, and perhaps most of all, desires and their irrevocable consequences.With its omniscient narration, `Errors` lets you get into each character`s head and explore his or her motivations.  As we follow Jacob into his classes, walk with him to his lovers` place or eavesdrop on his conversations with Annie, we climb a little deeper into his psyche.  Yet, motivations remain vague at best, alluded to, but never declared.Despite its god`s eye view, `Necessary Error, ` is Jacob Putnam`s story.  We follow him from his shy excursions into Prague`s gay underworld, to his na\u00efve infatuation with Lubos, and eventually to his uneasy,if more mature, `relationship` with Milo.  The two become lovers and friends if not actual partners.  This is young love, first love and its terminus is fixed.  Jacob will return home to grow up.  Yes, this is a novel of youth above all and the necessary errors we must make in order to stumble over the doorstep of maturity.Yet, Jacob wants to prolong a world of open ends for as long as possible.  \u201cHer mysticism fell in with an idea himself that he wanted to keep as long as he could of himself as a person on an errand whose nature was still unfolding.\u201d  Ditto for `Necessary Errors\u201d the novel as well.  It`s a journey of self-discovery melded with an exacting portrait of a certain time and place.  It`s `The Great Gatsby` coupled with `Giovanni`s Room.` Yet, these are only shadowy analogies.  Rather, Caleb Crain has crafted something highly original and always in style:  a great American novel."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Very boring book with very murky characterization that goes nowhere. The paean to Prague's sights make it a travelogue, but the uninteresting personae get in the way of even that objective. I always finish a book I start hoping for some peaks and valleys but this was a straight uneventful repetitive highway. I was taken in by a review I read. ES, San Antonio"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The setting for this book is Prague in the days following the Velvet Revolution.  President Havel has done what he can to draw the country (at that time, it was still Czechoslovakia).  Part of his efforts was to encourage bilingualality amongst the population.  Of course most people were already bilingual, but they spoke Czech and Russian.  The need to learn western languages in order to emerge from a Soviet dominated society and into modern commerce.  The principal characters in this book are a mix of people from English speaking countries who traveled to Prague to work in the language schools or to free-lance teaching of English as a Second Language. It is easy to dismiss this book as \u2018another circle of friends\u2019 book, but it is so much more.  The foreigners adapt to the Czech culture and the Czech people adapt to something that they do not totally understand, modern living without fear of being discovered by \u201cthem\u201d who have been looking over their shoulders in the past.I am sure that the businesses mentioned in Mr. Crain\u2019s book no longer exist.  They could only have existed in that twilight world of the change in culture.  I am sure that there is a modern version of the wonderful bakery, the \u2018country club\u2019 the subterranean meet and greet pub in today\u2019s Prague.  I visited Prague a few years after the time of this book and fell in love with it.  This is a wonderful tale and I am now homesick for Prague.  I guess that I need to plan another trip."}]}, "authors": ["Caleb Crain"], "isbn": "014312241X", "longitude": 14.4212535, "periods": ["1900s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "Necessary Errors",

relive all the anxieties and illusions and grand projects of one\u2019s own youth.\u201d James Wood, The New Yorker\r\n\r\nAn exquisite debut novel that brilliantly captures the lives and romances of young expatriates in newly democratic Prague\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s October 1990. Jacob Putnam is young and full of ideas. He\u2019s arrived a year too late to witness Czechoslovakia\u2019s revolution, but he still hopes to find its spirit, somehow. He discovers a country at a crossroads between communism and capitalism, and a picturesque city overflowing with a vibrant, searching sense of possibility. As the men and women Jacob meets begin to fall in love with one another, no one turns out to be quite the same as the idea Jacob has of them\u2014including Jacob himself.\r\n\r\nNecessary Errors is the long-awaited first novel from literary critic and journalist Caleb Crain. Shimmering and expansive, Crain\u2019s prose richly captures the turbulent feelings and discoveries of youth as it stretches toward adulthood\u2014the chance encounters that grow into lasting, unforgettable experiences and the surprises of our first ventures into a foreign world\u2014and the treasure of living in Prague during an era of historic change.\r\n\r\n\u201cFerociously observed. . . . We\u2019re not through with narratives about the Getting of Wisdom, Americans Abroad, Coming of Age, Gay Coming of Age, New Lost Generations. Among such works, a new narrative will be measured against Caleb Crain\u2019s fine book, which will endure as a powerful entry in the great fictional exploration of the meanings of liberation.\u201d The New York Review of Books", "asin": "014312241X", "rank": "625638", "city": "Prague", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41-yxAP-U1L.jpg", "country": "Czechia", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
