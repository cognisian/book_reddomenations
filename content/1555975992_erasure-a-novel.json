This was my first Everett novel and it was no surprise to me that I couldn't put it down. I don't care what anybody else says about this book or his other works, his style speaks to me in ways other authors just cant scratch. Its both beautiful and dark, so I think i'll keep reading his novels."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Well written and conceived.  A riddle inside an enigma.

The novel\u2019s central character, Monk, an author and scholar, seeks to place a new novel, after years of a modestly successful publishing career. He is told, by the literary establishment, that if he would only write about his experiences as a black man, he would be more commercially successful. Unsurprisingly, he rejects this idea as artistic sellout and a reinforcement of casual racist stereotypes. Can we imagine a white author being given this advice?Meanwhile, a novel called\u00a0We's Lives in Da Ghetto\u00a0by a new writer, a book filled with stereotypes playing to white expectations, explodes as a best seller. In a moment of pique, Monk bangs out a novel in the same vein, but light years from reality, blatant in its satire.\u00a0He sends it to his agent, under a pseudonym, expecting, hoping maybe, that it will be seen for the ridiculousness that it is.Monk\u2019s fake book becomes an instant hit. He is swimming in much-needed new money as he is forced into pseudonymic role-playing to hide his true authorship. Literary craziness ensues. In parallel, Monk is dealing with a complicated personal life that includes a mother slowly descending into the madness of Alzheimer\u2019s.Throughout, Everett plays with form, inserting imagined conversations between well-known historical figures, mostly artists and philosophers, about the nature of art, knowledge and commerce of both, drops in Latin phrases that summarize the moment (which I had to look up) and even includes Monk's full fake novel within the larger \"real\" novel, weaving all these elements together into a satisfying whole.\u00a0It\u2019s a heady mix that kept me deeply engaged while deftly and comically challenging readers to ponder the existential meaninglessness of race as a category for understanding human experience. \u00a0Highly recommended.\u00a0This review is excerpted from a longer blog post at Pumpjack Press."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "LIKE NOTHNG I HAVE READ.
