Roger Crowley\u2019s \u201cCity of Fortune: How Venice Ruled the Seas\u201d fit the bill perfectly for this read.  While the book does not cover the breadth of Venetian history (for example, only touching on the mythical roots of the origins of the city built upon sand flats in a lagoon), it covers the most important period of time which formed Venice into the fantastical city we find today.  Beginning with the Venetian attack upon Constantinople in 1204 and ending with the finality of the Ottoman-Venetian war in 1503, the book covers the amazing rise of this city built upon trade, and ends with its sad decline, succumbed to forces from the east and west.  Venice truly was a city built upon trade and commerce; however, it is worth noting from the book how such city-states inevitably fall prey to the same tides of war as any other nation.  As such, Venice built a powerful navy, and used it to great effect to secure their navigational rites of the sea.  Another thing that the book did a great job of describing was how the influence of Venice in the Easter Mediterranean, along with its famous and frequent wars with Genoa, played a significant role in the fall of the Byzantine Empire, and the rise of the Ottomans.  It also describes in detail the challenges Venice faced in maintaining its many colonies spread throughout the Mediterranean Sea; a challenge many other European nations would discover for themselves in the years ahead.  Overall, this was a wonderful and engaging read.  For any person interested in the Stati del Mare, this book is highly recommended."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book cleared up quite a few mysteries about Venice.  There are frequent descriptions from original sources by contemporary chroniclers that bring the tumultuous history of Venice to life. I did not expect this book to be a page-turner but for me it was.The writing is clear and concise. I've been to Venice several times but this last visit was immeasurably enhanced by the visceral and dramatic knowledge contained herein. You'll never feel quite as casual strolling around  Piazza San Marco, or shopping on the Rialto bridge after reading this book.Kudos to the author."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Wonderful narrative of how Venice ruled the seas and were modern merchants way ahead of the rest of the world.

How it ruled the oceans.  The rivalry with Genoa.  The back-and-forth with the Pope.  The long connection to Constantinople and the Black Sea.  The fascination with/ importance of Egypt.  And how the opportunity to make money outweighed everything else - including getting paid to ferry opposing armies across the Dardanelles, which ultimately led to the downfall of much of Europe (including those geniuses who piloted the boats).  Much has changed, much has not.  Much is now explained to me.  And now, I'm desperate to visit Venice even more than before.I'll also say that it's amazing how this historian can write a book that covers centuries, and is as readable as a novel.
