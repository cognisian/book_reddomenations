A collection of perspectives ranging from beautiful prose to journal entries, it traverses the lives of some of the last US pioneers and their descendants in the high country of Wyoming/Colorado. Realistic dialogue, at times eliciting hearty laughs, it is not without its balance of pensiveness and tears."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of the best books I've ever read!  I'm recommending it to my American history book club!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A literary, lyrical human history of a meadow on the Colorado / Wyoming border, this semi-biographical story is gorgeous in every respect. One of my favorite books of all time it perfectly captures a sense of place and the personalities of the people who have lived there. Sweet and sad at turns it keeps me locked in from the first page to the last every time I read it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "In his book \u201cThe Meadow\u201d, James Galvin simultaneously creates his own world and describes the world around him. Part novel, part documentary-styled telling, the beautiful prose contained in this book invites us into the reality of what it is to live in the rural West, not some romanticized version of it. Through what can be described as both stream of consciousness and reading its history like looking through a photo album, Galvin tells the tale of a parcel of land and the many people who have experienced it firsthand, the many people who have contributed to it\u2019s richness and whose lives have been enriched by it. For those who have been raised in rural areas, this book will hit home. For those less familiar, like myself, it will be an eye opener into what it\u2019s actually like to live in the real West. A tale about man\u2019s relationship with his environment, we get to see everything the rural life has to offer - from the beautiful countryside to the difficult winters, from the struggles the characters face every day to, ultimately, the people they are shaped into by these circumstances, \u201cThe Meadow\u201d gives us an intimate insight into these experiences. One could say Lyle is the main character, as we read and come to know about this self-sufficient man and his neighbors, their humourous, yet sometimes lonesome and poignant experiences. Yet, these people are only the lenses through which we come to know the story. The real protagonist is in the title of the book: the meadow, the environment in which these men live, their relationship with it and, ultimately, how even though they inhabited the land, they did not possess it but were, instead, possessed by it. A beautifully written work, \u201cThe Meadow\u201d will more than satisfy anyone who\u2019s lived similar experiences or wishes to know more intimately about what it\u2019s really like to live in the country."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I've never finished a book just to go back to page 1 and re-read it right away, but that's exactly what I'm about to do.
