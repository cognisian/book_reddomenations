I am once again completely blown away by the incredible gift Kate Morton has for storytelling! She creates interesting characters and takes her readers on an emotional journey through the tragedies and joys of their lives. I don't have words to describe how deeply she portrays the true nature of her characters, good and bad. And how grateful I am that she doesn't leave loose ends in her stories.I read this book through in 2 days between interruptions. I read a lot - usually 2 or 3 books a week. I'm particular about what I read and don't waste time reading junk, but rarely give 5-star ratings except for the most exceptional books. This was one of those, as was her book, \"The Distant Hours\" that I read last week. I've just finished all of her books and can't wait til she puts out the next one!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I am so sad to see this book come to an end.
