Michelangelo Buonarroti never wanted to paint the Sistine Chapel, though. Appointed by the temperamental Julius II, Michelangelo believed the suspiciously large-scale project to be a plot for failure conspired by his rivals and the \u201cWarrior Pope.\u201d After all, Michelangelo was not a painter\u2014he was a sculptor. The noble artist reluctantly took on the daunting task that would damage his neck, back, and eyes (if you have ever strained to admire the real thing, you know). Andrew Graham-Dixon tells the story behind the famous painted ceiling over which the great artist painfully toiled for four long years.\r\n\r\nLinking Michelangelo\u2019s personal life to his work on the Sistine Chapel, Graham-Dixon describes Michelangelo\u2019s unique depiction of the Book of Genesis, tackles ambiguities in the work, and details the painstaking work that went into Michelangelo\u2019s magnificent creation. Complete with rich, full-color illustrations and Graham-Dixon\u2019s articulate narrative, Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel is an indispensable and significant piece of art criticism. It humanizes this heavenly masterpiece in a way that every art enthusiast, student, and professional can understand and appreciate.", "asin": "1634502515", "rank": "173162", "city": "Rome", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VUj1tPk9L.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
