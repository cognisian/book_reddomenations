I thought I was somewhat \"literary\" in that I've read thousands of books of all eras, prose style, and voice, but now I feel just dumb.  I admire anyone who can honestly say they fully comprehended even half of this story and verse.  At least with Shakespeare, Chaucer, et. al. I could learn the prose, style, and references but this language was very obtuse and difficult to learn. Perhaps the readers were better versed in 18th-century British dialect and idiom than I.

I probably would have cut 100 pages but don't ask which ones, as I'd have to go back electronically through all those ale-house exchanges, some of which added little to any momentum line in the story). Pynchon plays time scrabble effectively, includes knowledgeable and respectful encounters with Mohawks and Iroquois, is playful with George Washington's slave, who makes kreplach, is Jewish (of a different sect than the Kosher) and sings H-va-na-gilah while Martha Washington brings in a tray of sweet-stuffed doughnuts, learned to the point of tedium in matters astronomical and surveyical (though why we need the antagonisms with the Royal Society and its astronomy master is another and distracting story; likewise on the extensive arguments in the air with Jesuits), and ultimately treats these two guys as distinct human beings with a significant fondness for each other.
