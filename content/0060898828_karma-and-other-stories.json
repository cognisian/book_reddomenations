I can only rate 'Karma' (the entire book) based on this one story (Karma, the story), so please take my review with a grain of salt, but as somebody who has both lived and worked in Boston, and also spent 8 years of my life married to an immigrant (a marriage which failed), I must say Ms. Reddi's poignant story about a displaced man who finds meaning and integration through unexpected avenues and opportunities to be especially poignant.  While my prior experience was not an India experience, but another immigrant population, I thought Ms. Reddi hit the problem (and solution) head-on.  Thank you for the little 'One City, One Story' booklet and live reading.  I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed re-reading the story seven months later, which is why I am only now leaving a review."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Rishi Reddi is such a meticulous master of dialogue and inspired painter of scene throughout this collection. These stories convey Indian and Indian American culture with a touch that is both illuminating for outsiders and honoring to those they portray. What is it to have a culture, to be of a place? Where does one's culture live? Is it transportable? Translatable? Sustainable across space and through time? Bequeath-able?The tethers connecting one generation to the next in these families both nourish and grasp, strengthen and thin when tradition is pressured to change and the future is asked to remember.Reddi plays the tensions of these strings clearly, honestly, with a sweetness that is complicated, and a compassion that doesn't take sides. Each character arrives at his or her own unique cultural identity, a blend in proportions that is personal, landing somewhere on the spectrum between there and here. They are every one of them real people, people a reader can care about and sympathize with and respect.Reddi's collection is beautiful."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Rishi Reddi is a great short storyteller. Her characters are so fully developed that I feel like I know them. I wanted to know about the characters in each story when I was done.  What happened to their lives, how did they cope and survive? I'd love to read a full novel from Ms Reddi, and I hope soon!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Karma and Other Stories by Rishi Reddi is a beautiful book in every way -- starting with the cover and extending to the lovely prose. I recently purchased multiple copies for friends who I believe will enjoy these stories that so skillfully explore the Indian American experience."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I lived in the Winchester/Lexington/Boston area for a while which made this book even more enjoyable.  However, I think I would have still enjoyed these captivating short stories even if I had not lived in this area.Karma and Other Stories really sums up the situations and lives of the people in these stories.  I bought further copies of this book and sent them to friends to read.  I hope you get the opportunity to read this book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It's unusual for me to read every story in a collection, but I did with this one. The characters seemed very authentic to me. I grew up among an Indian-American community in northeastern Ohio, and although Reddi's stories are set in the Boston area, I recognized these people, and I enjoyed learning about them.The stories are inter-linked, with the same characters appearing in different stories, which makes this feel almost like a novel. You see a glimpse of a character in one story, and in the next you read about that person in more depth."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I really enjoyed this book so far. I'm about 2/3 done, and I can't wait to finish. Reddi's writing is extremely accessible and gripping. Her prose is very calm; I read this book every night with a cup of chamomile tea, and the combination is very fitting. \"The Validity of Love\" is an absolutely wonderful story.My one question would concern the setting. Does the immigrant experience differ in various regions across America? From simple anecdotal experience, I think it does. Jhumpa Lahiri and Reddi both write from New England settings and I wonder how this dominates and obscures a more variegated Indian American experience?Of course, both writer's deal with much more than that simple trope. Read this collection for a wonderful examination of the human condition."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Written with imagination and sensitivity, this book of short stories is quite outstanding.
