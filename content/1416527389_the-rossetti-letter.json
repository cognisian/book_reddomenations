Somewhere about half way through (or was it 2/3 ?), not only did the pace pick up, but it seemed like the writing became more inspired, the characters became more interesting/dimensional  - and I started noticed touches of light humor here & there.  All this combined to make the latter half of the book a much better read, so I'm glad I stuck with it.I think the book still suffers a bit of an identity crisis - it's certainly not serious history, but rather, historical fiction-like.  It's got a little bit of romance, but it's definitely not in the romance category.  In the latter part of the book, it has moments where it resembles a good \"chick flick\" (that's the best way I have of describing that type of book), but then the moment passes.  Then there are scenes where it's starting to read like a \"DaVinci Code\" type novel, but then it changes again.  All of these a good directions to go - but perhaps the book suffers a bit from being just a little bit of everything without really doing any one thing extremely well.All in all, a good way to pass the time, but not one I'd go out of my way to recommend.  I am interested enough in the author to read her other book, to see what else she has to offer."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This gets five stars because it is a mystery that flashes back to the past but set in the present.

But she can't pass up this chance to complete her Ph.D. thesis on Alessandra Rossetti, a mysterious courtesan who wrote a secret letter to the Venetian Council warning of a Spanish plot to overthrow the Venetian Republic in 1618. Claire views Alessandra as a heroine and harbors a secret hope that her findings will elevate Alessandra to a more prominent place in history. But an arrogant Cambridge professor is set to present a paper at a prestigious Venetian university denouncing Alessandra as a co-conspirator -- a move that could destroy Claire's paper and career. \r\n\r\nAs Claire races to locate the documents that will reveal the courtesan's true motives, Alessandra's story comes to life with all the sensuality, political treachery, and violence of seventeenth-century Venice. Claire also falls under the city's spell. She is courted by a handsome Italian, matches wits with her academic adversary, bonds with her troubled young charge, and, amid the boundless beauty of Venice, recaptures the joy of living every moment. . . \r\n\r\nLayering wit and warmth into her portraits of two very different yet equally dynamic heroines, Christi Phillips shifts effortlessly between past and present in a remarkable novel that is at once a love story, a mystery, and an intriguing historical drama. Filled with beautifully rendered details of one of the world's oldest and most magical cities, The Rossetti Letter marks Phillips's debut as a writer of extraordinary skill and grace.", "asin": "1416527389", "rank": "1200807", "city": "Venice", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQzLZscdL.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
