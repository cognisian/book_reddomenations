The first book is awful. The writing is ponderous, she'll take an insane amount of time describing a minor detail, and the dialogue is stilted. It's like an editor read the first draft and suggested that everyone swear a lot, even when it doesn't make sense in the context. It's sprinkled with French words & phrases that are only sometimes translated. The characters are so bad they're laughable. Obviously whoever wrote the screenplays was a much better writer!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I do love a good murder mystery.
