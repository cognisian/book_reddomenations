This review is of the 1997 edition.This book served my purposes well, in that I was looking for an overview history of the entire period of American involvement. Karnow delivers on that, and also provides some broader context of the ancient Vietnamese history, its history as a colony, and the French war in Indochina.Originally published in 1983, Karnow includes updates from later visits. His first-hand reportage and interviews with leading figures (such as Giap and Westmoreland) give this account some immediacy and weight. If anything, Karnow was there, living these events and connecting them with other people who lived through them. Some of these interviews must have been for a related TV series at the time, and as far as TV-associated books go, this definitely rises to the top. Too, the photographs are well chosen and underscore the narrative, bringing this period to life. Karnow certainly understands the major issues, and for the most part covers the war adequately from all perspectives. For all these reasons, it's easy to see why this book is frequently recommended as the one-volume history to read.Yet, I wanted more from this. I find the first three chapters difficult to get through, mainly because they weave backwards and forwards in time. The first chapter is sort of an update to the earlier editions, covering Vietnam since the end of the war in 1975. The next chapter goes backwards, dealing with Vietnam as a European colony. Then the third chapter goes back even further, dealing with the long Vietnamese historical struggle for independence, often against China. To be sure, all of these chapters are worth reading -- and understanding Vietnam's long conflict with China is still relevant today -- but they are not arranged chronologically.After this, though, the book gets rolling. If there's one theme that comes through loudly and clearly, it was that Vietnam was fighting for its independence for a long time, and that this will to national autonomy and unity was something the United States could not beat, as others before it had tried to do as well. This seems banal to write, because it is well known by now, but it is nevertheless important to remember and still a salient takeway from this Karnow's history.Looking at the endnotes, it appears that much of the research was based on secondary sources that were used before the original publication. There are some limitations to this approach, mainly that there's little to no obvious archival work, but also that the books used for research are themselves dated. The coverage of North Vietnam seems a little weak, for understandable reasons, more understandable in 1983 than perhaps it is today.I also would have liked a better understanding of the military aspects of events, and Karnow seems to shy away from the kind of military descriptions that Rick Atkinson or Barbara Tuchman, other journalist-historians, excel at. Instead, Karnow focuses on higher political maneuverings, as the last chapter about the Nixon era especially highlights. So, given that this is a book about a war, I can't say that in either reading I've come away with a better understanding of how it was fought day to day. Even so, it remains a good starting point for a general reader looking to understand the dynamic sweep of Vietnam throughout its history, but especially for the American involvement in that country."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "proper perspective"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "An excellent and comprehensive coverage of a major historical event .Having lived through the war in another western society as a teenager, it is a revelation to put together what were confusing and sometimes obfuscurated facts. The book ( which accompanied the television history in 11 parts) has the added ability to furnish prose detail to News events at the time.  Both political systems and the Media in the US had to grow rapidly with the discovery that this War in particular was not simply one with soldiers but with citizens and families connected in a unique way around the evening dinner table . The book is a mature delivery of the warts and all facts of the \u201cfirst casualty\u201d, which is always, in any war, the truth.  Not just Presidents but everyone involved got caught up in the \u201cpolicy of limited candour\u201dIt was good to read also at this distance in time ..... a respectable 50 plus years.ReviewJim Waters"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Karnow's book is an interesting, almost too-detached account of Vietnam's history. He spends a good 1/4 of the book on the country's complex history and the bulk of the rest on political machinations during the war -- including an all-too-detailed account of the Diem coup. The battles and experiences of those who fought seem almost secondary. For example, Ia Drang barely warrants a sentence or two and the Tet Offensive Battle for Hue gets perhaps a page or two.The book is written well and provides lots of political narrative and insights into the many pressures LBJ and his team faced but lacks the emotion and grit of battle. Even the turmoil at home in the US seems secondary and fails to capture fully how the war was tearing us apart. It abruptly ends with the NVA's capture of the US embassy but offers no analytical poscript on the meaning of the war, its impact and its social costs."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The new addition of a book used in classes at the Air Force Academy.

That credit goes to Maggie Higgins, the little tigress who earned her chops starting in WW2. She immediately smelled a rat in the flack over the ousted Diem administration & when meeting the Buddhists condemning him. It's all in her book, OUR VIETNAM NIGHTMARE. I found Karnow's history of Vietnam to be a very good overview for Western readers, but he fails to comprehend, as opposed to Higgins & Sir Robert Thompson, that Diem was a relatively gentle leader who cared deeply for his people & did not want to see them butchered-- even the Communists. That got him assassinated. Ho praised the man, for heaven's sake! If one reads Karnow with that understanding, VIETNAM is a good starter, but not the last word on that sad saga.To really understand America's entry into the conflict, one must first understand the history of the Cold War & the events that took place after the Yalta & Potsdam Conferences. The Soviets took over Eastern Europe & Mao took China. Then the expansions began in Asia & Africa. There was every reason to believe in the Domino Theory, esp. after what happened in poor Hungary (see, THE BRIDGE AT ANDAU, J. Mitchener). America was not naive concerning the Soviets or the Maoist thugs. Just look how the USSR & the PRC suffered under Stalin & Mao respectively. We knew them to be sneaky, lying totalitarian regimes. What amazes me is that so many people overlook the fact that the only thing that saved both countries was taking the Capitalist Road, the very thing Mao warned against. The same happened in Nam. But I digress....Assassinating Diem was the worst thing our govt. assented to imho.
