Get a list of the series in order to enjoy it more.

Wonderful series."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "loved it"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Enjoy Mankell's mysteries"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very captivating !"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Wallander is a frustrating detective, too frequently not taking the easier or, from the reader's perspective, more obvious path.  He would rather take the solo route with its inevitable omissions and failures, than show confidence in more regular methods.  His approach, highlighting human failures on all sides, provides for a story that is gripping, at times chilling, and leaves the reader looking forward to the next saga in the life of Wallander."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book is a careful and clear description of the period in South Africa when Nelson Mandela was released from prison and the end of apartheid began.
