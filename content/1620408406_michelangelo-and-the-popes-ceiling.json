It is a wondrous read, with shocks and surprises galore.  I won't spoil any...Let's just say that Michelangelo showed how great an artist he really was with a project he both never wanted to do and was totally unsuited for, to boot.

Despite having completed his masterful statue David four years earlier, he had little experience as a painter, even less working in the delicate medium of fresco, and none with challenging curved surfaces such as the Sistine ceiling's vaults. The temperamental Michelangelo was himself reluctant: He stormed away from Rome, incurring Julius's wrath, before he was eventually persuaded to begin.\r\n\r\nMichelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling recounts the fascinating story of the four extraordinary years he spent laboring over the twelve thousand square feet of the vast ceiling, while war and the power politics and personal rivalries that abounded in Rome swirled around him. A panorama of illustrious figures intersected during this time-the brilliant young painter Raphael, with whom Michelangelo formed a rivalry; the fiery preacher Girolamo Savonarola and the great Dutch scholar Desiderius Erasmus; a youthful Martin Luther, who made his only trip to Rome at this time and was disgusted by the corruption all around him. Ross King blends these figures into a magnificent tapestry of day-to-day life on the ingenious Sistine scaffolding and outside in the upheaval of early-sixteenth-century Italy, while also offering uncommon insight into the connection between art and history.", "asin": "1620408406", "rank": "215054", "city": "Rome", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514Fcr2wD1L.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
