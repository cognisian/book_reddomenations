It is an old book and written in a style that is hard to read.  Hardly a page went by that did not contain a word that I didn't have to look up on my Kindle and half the time they had no definition or the word was archaic. There were many quotations in German and Latin, that unless you are a classical scholar, you would not recognize.  I do not see how this will add to my enjoyment of the trip, and will let the tour company know.  I have warned my traveling companions and fellow readers not to waste their money on this."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Not for everyone, but if it is for you, it REALLY is for you. Brilliant, unique, peripatetic.Yeah, I just wanted to use that word."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This book is exceptionally well researched and written in graphic manner. The range and variety of events and people he experienced is evidence of what must have been the attractiveness of his own personality. This is backed up by his own wide reading and scholarship. While he is describing what happened in 1933 the book is unusual in that it was written many years later based on diaries and his recollections but I think also coloured by his later life experiences. Lastly I would like to add that his style free flowing and carries the reader along."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I really wanted to like this book, I really did. I'd read another book largely about Leigh Fermor, as well as the New Yorker's fantastic profile of him. I'd even read and recited poems from his funeral program. But about half way through \"A Time of Gifts,\" I had to stop. He's clearly a very gifted writer, but the book is extremely thick. If you do read it, make sure to have an English dictionary at hand.
