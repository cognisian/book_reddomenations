I felt it is somewhat slow paced, but enjoyable. I almost quit though at one point, however I am sincerely glad I stuck with it. The Grace character is beautifully written. However I could have done completely without Simon Jordan and his distracting side story. Hated him in the end."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I found his novel thought provoking with the well crafted characters with individual world views and human foibles. The creation of existing in a different era was successful as well. She also brought up important questions about truth we think we know, violence and different class powers. I\u2019ve yet to see the six part series on Netflix!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is the first book by Margaret Atwood that I have read. The big hype is over \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d because of the Hulu series, but the tale of \u201cAlias Grace\u201d is much more in my interest. I saw the trailer for it and the impending release on Netflix, so I just had to drop everything to read it. I thoroughly enjoyed it too. I was expecting more of a \u2018gasp\u2019 revelation at the end though. There was a gasp, but a small one and without the usual cursing.I\u2019ve watched the first episode on the show now and I know I will enjoy that just as much as the book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very interesting story based on fact.

Years later, Dr. Simon Jordan--an up-and-coming expert in the burgeoning field of mental illness--listens to Grace's story, from her family's difficult passage from Ireland to Canada, to her time as a maid in Thomas Kinnear's household. As Grace relives her past, Jordan draws her closer to a dark maze of relationships and her lost memories of the day her life was shattered.\r\n\r\nSuperbly evoking a century past, and alive with mesmerizing storytelling, Alias Grace is vintage Atwood.\r\n\r\n\"Atwood has surpassed herself, writing with a glittering, singing intensity.\" New York Review of Books", "asin": "0385490445", "rank": "1442", "city": "Toronto", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51EBc6V-ngL.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
