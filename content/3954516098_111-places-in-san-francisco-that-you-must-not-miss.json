I feel like this book is perfect for locals or people who are already VERY familiar with the major SF tourist sites AND city neighborhoods, and who will have many weeks/months/years/the time to explore the city's off-the-beaten-path sites. If you're looking for a visitor's guide book that will cover the major sightseeing attractions, this is NOT the book for you. For example, this book will does not cover the Golden Gate Bridge, the Palace of Fine Arts, Fisherman's Wharf, nor Coit Tower; nor does it give any high-level summary about the different neighborhoods within the city. This book is written with the assumption that you're already familiar with all of that already. If it's your first week (or even month) in SF, I would highly recommend going with a different city guide book first, so you can become better acquainted with San Francisco before coming to this book, as this one seems like it would be much better appreciated by those who are locals.From a Bay Area native's point of view- I really love this book! I like how there are pictures for every site mentioned (the picture page faces the page of each site's story), and I get a real kick reading up on the history of each site. The blurbs are memorable and well-written, and I like that they aren't too long to read. It's a nice plus that public transit lines are listed for each location. Additionally, the map at the back of the book, which includes markers for each of the places mentioned in the book, could be helpful to use for planning a trip around the city... or to plan a little fun sightseeing detour if you're, say, going out to dinner and happen to be close to some of the sites mentioned in the book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The photos are great and the blurbs about each place are helpful, entertaining and informative."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Got this as a gift for father.

From the gold rush to the Golden Gate, the City by the Bay has always basked in the glow of its colorful and celebrated history and world-renowned landmarks. But for those who live and love on this compact seven-mile by seven-mile metropolis, San Francisco is a treasure trove of unusual neighborhood sights and places that sparkle with the allure of hidden pleasures and local lore. \r\n\r\nDiscover a stairway that transports you from the depths of the ocean to the heights of outer space; take a spin class amidst the grand elegance of a repurposed 1920s movie palace; or slide down a century-old sundial that sits at the center of what was once California's first racetrack for cars. \r\n\r\nThis is the real San Francisco. Strung together, the 111 experiences gathered here tell the B-side story of the city once romantically known as the Paris of the West.
