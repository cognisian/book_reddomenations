Why get rich off of one novel when, you can just rework it with different characters, but basically the same plot?  Heck, it\u2019s worked a few times now for Dan Brown.  Except, it\u2019s not really all new characters.  But not Alan or Ellie, not the kids.  Instead, you get the annoyingly verbose and amazingly revived Ian Malcom!  \u201cOh, he wasn\u2019t dead, just mostly dead.\u201d  Just because \u201cmostly dead\u201d worked in The Princess Bride, does not mean that it will work here.Aside from that, this was a fair book.

The Lost World is also great, I may enjoy the novel more than the first, but it\u2019s film adaption wasn\u2019t even close.

His ability, to weave a riveting, action-packed and insight-heavy work of art, deserves nothing less than stellar (5-stars is not good enough for him).He has a gift of craftsmanship at building and empowering a character, then designing a personality is that is complete.I commend him for the creation of Ian Malcolm. The knowledge imparted by this man in the book is worthy of its own Bible.For Michael Crichton to be able to conceptualise and then explain unrealised abstract concepts, further strengthens my belief of his intellect being superior than most! He clearly had an ability to absorb knowledge and invent his own.I quote Ian Malcom from the book as a proof:\"Looking at the fossil record is like thumbing through a family photo album. You know that the album isn\u2019t complete. You know life happens between the pictures. But you don\u2019t have any record of what happens in between, you only have the pictures. So you study them, and study them. And pretty soon, you begin to think of the album not as a series of moments, but as reality itself. And you begin to explain everything in terms of the album, and you forget the underlying reality.This is Pearls of Wisdom!You are immortalised by your books!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "ok"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "It was a good book.I wanted to keep reading. Lots of scientific rambling that I think went on for too long and too much. It was a little unbelievable how Malcolm was always the one to understand everything.
