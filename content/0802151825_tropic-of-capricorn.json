Would not recommend unless you feel the need to be stirred up by the sexual thoughts and  exploits of another.  This book was referred to by some writers in some  articles about writing that  I had been reading --  as having been  very influential to them as young men, so I thought I would read it to see why.  I had no idea what the book was about.  Didn't take long to see how reading such a book might profoundly affect a young man.  If I had read it when I was a young man or teenager it would surely have thrown gasoline on a fire that was already raging. Maybe every young man has lived his own version of this book to some extent.  As far as how studying this writing for technique might add to the toolbox of a writer, I surely do not know, but think that maybe subject matter can overwhelm and override such considerations -- maybe like a well written book on torture might be safely left off of one's  reading list."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Lordy what a waste of ink and paper."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of the best author of thee 20th century"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Most brilliant and compelling author I have ever come across.
