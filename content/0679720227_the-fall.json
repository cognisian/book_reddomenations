The reader was immediately reminded of a lunch meeting at a university level between a talkative student of the humanities and a quieter listener of the sciences. At one point, the humanities fellow complains that a casual examination of his hand gives no hint of the underlying complex of biology, physics and chemistry. Therefore, the empirical and theoretical viewpoints come into conflict. \"Camus,\" the empiricist demands,  \"Takes the point of view that men are responsible for their decisions!\" \"Well,\" suggests the theorist, \"Science has shown that decisions are made a few milliseconds before one is consciously aware of them. Hawking suggests that free will is attributed to humans because the process of decision making is too complex to be sequentially followed.\" This matter is the crux of the position that Camus takes. Any verbal exchange beyond this point is rendered meaningless. \"The Fall,\" is essentially \"art\" : a statement of one man's view of reality which collapses on empirical testing. Therefore, treat this volume as an entertaining exchange between two casual friends rather than a far reaching depiction of an injunction against mankind in general."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Love this book.

First published in 1956, it is his last complete work of fiction.\r\n\r\nSet in Amsterdam, The Fall consists of a series of dramatic monologues by the self-proclaimed \"judge-penitent\" Jean-Baptiste Clamence, as he reflects upon his life to a stranger. In what amounts to a confession, Clamence tells of his success as a wealthy Parisian defense lawyer who was highly respected by his colleagues; his crisis, and his ultimate \"fall\" from grace, was meant to invoke, in secular terms, The Fall of Man in the Garden of Eden.\r\n\r\nThe Fall explores themes of innocence, imprisonment, non-existence, and truth. In a eulogy to Albert Camus, existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described the novel as \"perhaps the most beautiful and the least understood\" of Camus' books.\r\n\r\nWikipedia", "asin": "0679720227", "rank": "49715", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41tRcpBhbnL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
