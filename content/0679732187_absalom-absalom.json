(the title relates to the return of the central character\u2019s son, Charles; Absalom, according to the Jewish bible, was the third son of King David.  A handsome, high-living man, Absalom killed his older half-brother for the rape of their sister) is set in the early to middle 19th century, mostly in Mississippi.  The central character, Thomas Sutpen, a rough, ungentlemanly fellow, appears in a small Mississippi town with 20 slaves and considerable funds of suspect origin.  He acquires 100 square miles of property 12 miles outside the town, builds an enormous mansion, grows cotton, marries the town shopkeeper\u2019s daughter, and has a son, Henry, and a daughter, Judith.  Sutpen had married the daughter of a Haitian sugar planter, who bore him a son whom he named, Charles Bon.  When Sutpen discovered that his new wife has negro blood, he pays to have the marriage annulled under obscure circumstances.  In his mid-twenties, Charles Bon suddenly appears at the U of Miss. where Henry is attending and the two become friends, though Henry does not learn Charles\u2019 identity until later, when Charles begins to realise who his father is.  Henry and his mother begin to promote the marriage of Judith to Charles.  Sutpen travels to New Orleans (where Charles first appeared) and learns who he is.  On his return, he tells Henry that Charles is his half-brother and the marriage will not be permitted.  Henry refuses to believe that Charles is his brother.  The Civil War intervenes.  Charles decides to break the impasse by marrying Judith, and Henry kills him.  Other deaths follow until there is no mansion and no living heirs to the Sutpen name.This is an intriguing story, deeply coloured with the culture of the Old South.  Falkner\u2019s story-telling technique is quite oblique: he makes use of different narrators to illuminate parts of the story that they know first-hand, have heard from others, or suspect, so that the reader is able to gradually pick up the thread.  This technique creates a sense of mystery, uncertainty and ambiguity about a story which was nearly a century old.  Faulkner\u2019s writing is a poetic, erudite, stream of consciousness by the narrator, particularly when the subject is what a character is thinking or feeling; not infrequently, these dissections of a character\u2019s motives can go on for two pages or more, and they are not easy to read, because they lack fluency and are full of parenthetical statements.  Sentences can go on for half a page.  Nonetheless, a careful reader will, at thinking and feeling levels, understand the character.  There is almost no dialogue in the novel; nearlyh all is revealed by the narrators.  Interestingly, the narrators never set the scenes: what the town, the battlefield, the mansion looked like.The characters are all clearly drawn.  I found it somewhat surprising that all of the female characters were presented as passive.  One gets a clear sense of what life was like in the Old South, particularly before the Civil War, from the point of view of the wealthy few, the middle class and the slaves and poor whites. The slaves themselves had various classes.  As a literally minded person, I found it difficult to accept that Thomas Sutpen could have acquired the wealth he had as the overseer of a Haitian sugar plantation: something is missing.  Similarly, it is doubtful that Sutpen, 20 unskilled slaves and a French architect could have built the huge, elaborate mansion \u2018Sutpen\u2019s Hundred\u2019.Absalom,Absalom! is not an easy read, but it should not be overlooked if one is interested in distinctive American writing \u2013 particularly about the Old South."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Fine; as promised. Thank you"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Faulkner was a brilliant stylist!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "William Faulkner\u2019s Absalom, Absalom! is a pivotal tome in classic American literature. The rich, complex narrative appears inaccessible to many modern readers, but the stream of consciousness style was the haute couture of the modernist era. Faulkner once again transports the reader to his famed\u2014and fictional\u2014Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi, though unlike in his other works, he includes a map and a chronology of the events. Absalom, Absalom! is a difficult novel to unpack, but the themes of the tale have a timeless resonance. In what is likely his most famous and best remembered work, Faulkner explores the idea of home, of wanting to belong and have a place, and how that desire oft times is misconstrued with a physical structure. Sutpen\u2019s \u201cdesign\u201d and blind ambition leads him further and further into moral degradation and ruin, and each character\u2019s own hopes and dreams are influenced by Sutpen\u2019s actions. The ripple effect of misguided ambition is felt through multiple generations. Faulkner tells the same narrative from multiple perspectives. There is no linear sense of plot arc, but rather an accordion folding of time, creating a sense of fluidity and unreliability. The narrators carefully unwind the threads of memory only to have them unravel and snarl once more, for each character\u2019s memory is laden with the complications of fallacies and inaccuracies. Those familiar with Faulkner\u2019s work will know that he features particular characters throughout the course of his oeuvre, and the most poignant figure in this tale may be that of Quentin Compson, a young man who is haunted by the mysterious tragedies of the past and tormented in the present, and whose tale is told further in The Sound and the Fury. In this story, he is a boy on the cusp of adulthood, about to leave his Mississippi home for a Harvard education, and increasingly obsessed with the past. As in all of Faulkner\u2019s tales, the South is as much a character as it is a setting, rich in heritage, distinct and regional, steeped in history, and\u2014much like Faulkner\u2019s stories\u2014grounded in tragedy and family. Issues of race and social structures permeate the tale, but at its heart, Absalom, Absalom! is a story about the tangled web that is family. Dysfunction, incest, betrayal, and murder drive the family tragedies at the center of the story. Faulkner\u2019s work is a stellar example of the modernist era of the early twentieth century. Filled with prose that is in turns dense and poetic, Absalom, Absalom! is a classic ode to the American South, to the complexities and heartbreak of family, to the nostalgic influence of home and memory, and to the deadly whirlpool of ambition.__________Recommendation Highly recommended for fans of classic American literature, particularly literature set in the south and written in the modernist style"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Amazing book with fearless analysis of Southern culture still relevant."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Beautiful"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The story of how Quintin ( The Sound & the Fury ) sees the South.Told from different points of view."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Ordered this ... it came in german.
