Though I think I liked them better when I first found them, and when I was a lot younger, they still pack a wallop.  Full of humor, sly digs at social norms, politicians, and hypocrisy, they are nothing if not sexy.  Not only that but they constantly reveal in most colorful terms the society of the Brazilian city of Salvador de Bahia full of its Afro-Portuguese culture, the mysteries of the African religion called candombl\u00e9, and a spicy cuisine second to none.  Is this picture totally accurate?  Does it really matter?  Perhaps it is a fantasy Brazil, but it is a nice place to dwell while you read the adventures of various picaresque characters and sensuous women.  Is this novel \"politically correct\"?  Definitely not, but if that's what you are looking for, give Jorge Amado a miss.  He doesn't give a damn, but plows full speed ahead, but unlike Donald Trump, he's always kind.This novel, which I think could have been cut because the author repeats himself quite a bit, tells the fanciful story of a rather demure young woman who marries a rake, a gambler, a vagabond who spends every penny he ever gets his fingers on in the back street casinos and whorehouses of Bahia.  They live a crazy life for seven years, he betraying her at every step.  She suffers but loves him anyway.  She sets up a cooking school which enables her to survive.  Suddenly Vadinho, the gambler, drops dead in the middle of Carnival antics.  I'm not spoiling anything....that's on page 5 of this 518 page monster.  Then there's an interlude of sad times, of longing, and a parade of useless suitors.  At last Dona Flor, for that is her name, meets Dr. Teodoro, a bassoon-playing, pharmacist straight arrow.  They marry.  But Vadinho returns.  How and what happens is what you have to find out by reading this entertaining (if overly long) book.  If you stick with it, you'll get into some wacky magico-realism and a lot of other stuff.  Enjoy."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Too hard to follow and a rather unlikely plot.  Did provide cultural insight into latin culture.  We used as a book club book and only one person out of 10 got past the first 40 pages.  And, these are avid readers.  Say no more."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Good South American novel.  Most are hard to understand."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A wonderful story - it's particularly evocative for me since I've spent some time in Salvador in my youth and I'm familiar with many of the general places described here and used in the film of the same name.  To a degree I suspect that it helps to be comfortable with both the Brazilian culture and Latin American literature in general but the story is timeless and so beautifully drawn that I think almost anyone can get to grips with it.  The book is of course a translation from the original Portuguese but it's very rare that you notice this - it's an easy read for a native English speaker."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is one of my all time favorite books.It's sexy, sultry, and funny all at the same time.I love the scene where she was teaching a cooking class and segues into a memory of her first husband eating with the palm oil on his lips.
