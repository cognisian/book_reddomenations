I went to Turkey hoping to find food as good.  With the exception of one small town on the coast I never did.  And the lentil soup is absolutely the best.I've had the book since it first came out, when the lentil soup was featured in Gourmet magazine.  I have given it to friends, on whose shelves I'm happy to say it looks as dog-eared as it does on mine.  So thanks Ozcan Ozan, for giving us such a wonderful opportunity to cook the foods of Turkey."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great place, great food, great prices !!

I have made two recipes to rave reviews!  I purchased this book after it was recommended by in an article in the Food section of the Washington Post.  The hardest part of this was finding one or two of the specialty ingredients.  I look forward to making many more of the recipes from this book.  This is a great purchase!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It isn't often that I buy a cookbook where EVERY recipe is something I would make.  I bought this particular book because the author is Turkish and I wanted to cook Turkish food the way a Turk would cook it.  There were a couple of spices that my local grocery store doesn't carry (and never heard of) but Penzey's came to the rescue.  If you live in a large metropolitan area, you shouldn't have a problem finding everything.  In a smaller town, you may need to rely on an online source for some of those hard-to-find ingredients.  Well worth it.... I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to cook authentic Turkish food."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I wanted an authentic Turkish cookbook.
