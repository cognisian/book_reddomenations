The author has clearly done her research, and is skilled at plot as well as character development.  The landscape and culture are skillfully depicted...as a reader I felt immersed on several levels.

The beginning kept me engaged but somewhere around the middle I found myself losing interest. The story started to slow down and become monotonous. I finished the book and I'm glad that I kept at it but felt like a lot of pages were wasted rambling on without adding any value to the story. Lots of reviews rave about this book but it's just not a book for me."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Wow. What an incredibly haunting and tragic read.

Best book I read all year!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I'm a little surprised at some reviews that cite lack of character development.  It's not something that I ever thought about during the increasing suspense regarding the many relationships between individuals and their stark surroundings.  The novel discusses relationships between friends, lovers, family members, officials, and so much more.  Hopefully the reader won't miss the richness of the plot as Agnes reveals some of the worst and best moments of her young life -- to the eventual murder in which she was involved.  Some of it is revealed in her own narrative.  Some of it is revealed through her relationship with a priest.  And, finally, some of it is revealed to one of her guardians who gains affection for her.  My husband commented that character development may or may not be important to a novel -- but, identifying with characters certainly is important -- and, I definitely identified with many of the individuals even though the story takes place in the early 1800s.  The only problem I had with the novel was with Icelandic names!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "An interesting tale woven around a true story about a woman sentenced for execution for murder set in Iceland in the 1800s. The historical aspect of everyday life for the people living at that time expertly conveyed the hardships of daily living as well as the social mores of the time. Beautifully written, the story travels at a steady pace throughout the book, and I came to understand the characters more as Agnes recounted her view of the events that had transpired. For me, this story had an air of heaviness about it, the circumstances surrounding the main character was quite sad, and the ending was very emotional. This is a very well researched novel and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Engaging true-ish historical story of a woman sentenced to die in Iceland in the 1800\u2019s.

Only T\u00f3ti, a priest Agnes has mysteriously chosen to be her spiritual guardian, seeks to understand her. But as Agnes's death looms, the farmer's wife and their daughters learn there is another side to the sensational story they've heard.\r\n\r\nRiveting and rich with lyricism, BURIAL RITES evokes a dramatic existence in a distant time and place, and asks the question: How can one woman hope to endure when her life depends upon the stories told by others?\r\n\r\nHannah Kent was born in Adelaide in 1985. As a teenager she travelled to Iceland on a Rotary Exchange, where she first heard the story of Agnes Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir.\r\n\r\nHannah is the co-founder and deputy editor of Australian literary journal Kill Your Darlings. In 2011 she won the inaugural Writing Australia Unpublished Manuscript Award.
