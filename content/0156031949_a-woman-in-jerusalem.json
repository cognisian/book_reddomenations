Her body lies nameless in a hospital morgue. She had apparently worked as a cleaning woman at a bakery, but there is no record of her employment. When a Jerusalem daily accuses the bakery of \"gross negligence and inhumanity toward an employee,\" the bakery\u2019s owner, overwhelmed by guilt, entrusts the task of identifying and burying the victim to a human resources man. \r\n\r\nThis man is at first reluctant to take on the job, but as the facts of the woman\u2019s life take shape\u2014she was an engineer from the former Soviet Union, a non-Jew on a religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and, judging by an early photograph, beautiful\u2014he yields to feelings of regret, atonement, and even love.\r\n\r\nAt once profoundly serious and highly entertaining, A. B. Yehoshua astonishes us with his masterly, often unexpected turns in the story and with his ability to get under the skin and into the soul of Israel today.", "asin": "0156031949", "rank": "1195020", "city": "Jerusalem", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512k5z8yilL.jpg", "country": "Israel", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
