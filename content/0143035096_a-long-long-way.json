Once there, he encounters a horror of violence and gore he could not have imagined and sustains his spirit with only the words on the pages from home and the camaraderie of the mud-covered Irish boys who fight and die by his side.  \r\n\r\nDimly aware of the political tensions that have grown in Ireland in his absence, Willie returns on leave to find a world split and ravaged by forces closer to home. Despite the comfort he finds with his family, he knows he must rejoin his regiment and fight until the end. \r\n\r\nWith grace and power, Sebastian Barry vividly renders Willie\u2019s personal struggle as well as the overwhelming consequences of war.", "asin": "0143035096", "rank": "307625", "city": "Dublin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516ZmNqH1IL.jpg", "country": "Ireland", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
