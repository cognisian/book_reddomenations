Thank you, my friend! It is now one of my all time favorite novels. One would not think a book about suicide would be laugh out loud funny. But it is, over and over again. It is also incredibly insightful, well-written, tragic and beautiful. AMPS resonates with some of my personal history, so it might not ring as true for everyone as it does for me, but I still think it would be a worthwhile read for almost anyone. Thank you Miriam Toews."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This woman is the best writer in the whole freakin' world!

It's a heartbreaking story, told with a sensitive touch and quite a bit of humor. Not for Mennonites, who don't come off looking very good.  Thought provoking -- one of those books where you don't know the right thing to do -- and neither do the characters."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book is so honest and intimate - as a reader you live through the eyes and mind of the protagonist.  Just enough laugh out loud moments to keep it from being soul-crushing.  And sprinkled with enough literary references that it feels more intellectual than indulgent.  This is a great read."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I gave up quickly.

Honest, heartbreaking, sad but often funny too. It is so well written and not too sentimental. I lived through the exact situation beautiful, smart talented sister who ultimately killed herself. Like the characters in the book, it is a lifetime of sadness building to the suicide, it unfolds in the book much like in real life. People who have not been through it may not feel parts are realistic or believable but the book captures the feeling, the desperation, the helplessness the ultimate inability to give your loved one a reason to go on.It is hard to put into words how this book made me feel. It was a comfort after the passing of my sister to know it is what it is, this is just how people feel."}]}, "authors": ["Miriam Toews"], "isbn": "1940450713", "longitude": -79.387207, "periods": ["2000s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "All My Puny Sorrows", "word_cloud": "love friend chose club think time favorite novel suicide loud funny also incredibly insightful tragic beautiful resonate personal history true everyone still think almost anyone woman best writer whole freaking world finish section group paragraph want cry perfect completely love story really get heartbreaking story tell sensitive touch quite bit humor not come look good provoke know right thing character honest intimate live eye mind protagonist enough laugh loud moment enough literary reference feel intellectual indulgent great give quickly never care sister interest perspective person suffer disease desire die ramble favorite woman deal suicidal family member enjoy flashback sister grow community give excellent portrait live suicidal love heartbreaking sad often funny well write sentimental live exact situation beautiful smart talented sister ultimately kill character lifetime sadness building suicide unfolds much real life people part realistic believable capture feel desperation helplessness ultimate inability give love reason hard put word make feel comfort pass sister know people feel", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature"], "summary": "Elf and Yoli are sisters.
