THIS book certainly is not of Pulitzer quality.  I think he was trying to write another Out of Africa---and fell far short.  I was tempted to quit the book about half way but I rarely do that with a book.  The ending did wrap up some things in very bizarre ways, but at least it had an ending.  Having lived in Nigeria for two years, i could relate to much of the African aspects, and that is what brought me to the book.  I don't think all the sexual intrigues were vital to the plot.  I would have liked to have seen a couple hundred less pages and concentrate on the complications and paradoxes of African life"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Have worked and lived n Sub-Saharan Africa.

The story speaks to war, love, survival, mysticism and traditional chritianity; and all of the above are major themes in \"Acts of Faith.\" Caputo is able to shift readers' loyalties as the story moves forward. I had trouble setting the book down! Throughout, Caputo drops little witticisms that gave me a smile and forced me to go back and re-read these insights several times. I think he did a top-notch job in characterizing christian thought in average people. It was quite insightful, even damning, to follow Quinette's shameful manipulation of her understanding of the Bible. Quinette's faith in God, or is it her faith in her own desires, nearly made me crack a rib."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Accurate depiction of the situation in that region of the world.

Into this desolate theater come aid workers, missionaries, and mercenaries of conscience whose courage and idealism sometimes coexist with treacherous moral blindness. There\u2019s the entrepreneurial American pilot who goes from flying food and medicine to smuggling arms, the Kenyan aid worker who can\u2019t help seeing the tawdry underside of his enterprise, and the evangelical Christian who comes to Sudan to redeem slaves and falls in love with a charismatic rebel commander. \r\n\r\nAs their fates intersect and our understanding of their characters deepens, it becomes apparent that Acts of Faith is one of those rare novels that combine high moral seriousness with irresistible narrative wizardry.   \r\n\r\n\"Nothing is omitted in this ambitious novel depicting the turbulent lives of several aid workers at the height of the Sudanese civil war. Caputo, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and the author of a Vietnam memoir, includes more characters, plot lines, and big ideas than a single mind can track, but he writes so authoritatively that it doesn't matter. In the course of nearly seven hundred pages, he encompasses military offensives, the slave trade, arms-running operations, passionate romances, religious conversions, childhood memories, and rampant corruption, in a portrait of a place where \"God and the Devil are one and the same.\" Caputo lays the groundwork of the novel carefully, introducing his disparate cast of characters; then, as the various plot lines come together, the book picks up speed. Caputo may have set out to write an epic parable about the dangers of uncritical belief, but he ended up with, quite simply, a great story.\"  The New Yorker\r\n", "asin": "0375725970", "rank": "364845", "city": "Khartoum", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514zuFMzemL.jpg", "country": "Sudan", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
