The author writes with  compassion, wit and understanding of human strength, frailty, mental instability and (for an \"outsider\") shows remarkable insight into  the struggles early settlers faced before the world discovered our thorny paradise.

Reading this book along with the recently republished \"Satan Came To Eden (available now on Amazon in print and kindle) is a real treat, because you get to view the story from many angles. It's a juicy tale and Traherne makes it even more compelling. He didn't solve the \"mystery\" but he certainly spared no effort to dig as deeply as he could into it.Unfortunately, just as Satan Came To Eden comes into print, this book goes OUT of print---darn!

The tales were of nudism, free love communes, stainless steel dentures - a latter-day Garden of Eden. \r\n\r\nBut the truth was even stranger. Friedrich Ritter, an eccentric German intellectual, and his long-suffering companion Dora Strauch, were the first arrivals. Once established, they were soon joined by others. Most bizarre and dangerous was the self-styled Baroness Wagner-Bosquet. She ruled her three young male lovers with a riding crop, a pearl-handled revolver and insatiable sexual demands - terrorising other settlers. Her mysterious disappearance and the discovery of unidentified bodies on a nearby island perplexed the world. Now The Galapagos Affair unravels the whole incredible story.", "asin": "0712668233", "rank": "532758", "city": "Gal\u00e1pagos Islands", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517Xkj8uv6L.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
