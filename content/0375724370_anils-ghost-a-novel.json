Anil was such a complex and profound character that I wasn't fond of the chapters where she was missing, but I also see that the story needed to be told from several perspectives. I do wish it had ended with Anil though. I wanted to know what she would do and where she would go,This is a book that needs to be discussed.

Not because we have a full picture of Anil (her former relationship with a woman named Leaf in New Mexico, indeed, the whole American Southwest portion of her life doesn't connect to anything in Sri Lanka; and there is little about her former stay in England)--we don't-- but because we come to live Sri Lanka in all its horrors, in all its varied spaces, and in all its life types. If I put the book down, I was drawn to return to this atmosphere time and again. Sure, there is little compelling about trying to identify a brutally murdered body, the resolution of which occurs too fast. But it's what happens along the way, and reflections on Sri Lankan culture and philosophical heritage from Sarath, Anil's partner forensic archaeologist, that makes a difference. As for the rest of Anil's character development, one cannot leave her sexuality aside, and, in a Bhuddist culture that doesn't worry about nakedness, Ondaatje handles this very well, though not in the same detail as he does with field surgery."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of my favorite authors.
