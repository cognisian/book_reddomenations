The author goes on and on at length about all sorts of leads, many of them bogus, from all sorts of shady characters, but it the end, the book doesn't really reveal much.  You'll get more information about the infamous theft by Googling the theft and reading articles posted by the Boston Globe over the years.In one chapter, the author takes it upon himself to fly to Ireland to search for Whitey Bulger in hopes that he may lead to the stolen artwork.  This is just as ridiculous as it sounds.  What are the chances that someone will just simply run into Whitey Bulger in some remote village in the Irish countryside?  And let's say, by some enormous stroke of luck (bad luck?), that he DID actually encounter Bulger in Ireland.  Does the author really think that Bulger would simply hand over the artwork?  You'd be a million times more likely to be killed than to be given the artwork.In another chapter, the author wrote an imagined conversation between himself and the fictitious holder of the artwork in some dark room, fantasizing about the things he would say and the responses he would get from this phantom character.  Why am I reading this?  I want facts, not fantasies.The author had another chapter where he writes about some character named Turbo who just-might-possibly-maybe-but-not-really have clues about the theft.  Then later he dismisses Turbo as being a habitual liar, rendering his far-fetched babbling no credence.  Why fill pages of a book with false leads?  Why pad the duration of the book with conjecture?  I don't want to hear false information. I want the facts of the case and credible leads.I gave it two stars because the hardcover has some nice color pictures in it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Caught the Gardner bug.  The book was published in 2008 and the mystery has still not been solved.  I find it hard to believe that the  FBI never interviewed a witness that saw the two robbers that night or didn't interview the witness on a timely basis. A good resource for someone still hunting and hoping for the reward.  Fascinating story real!y.  I'd vote that David Turner was the culprit.  I wish I could write the tell all story of his life!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This book starts off very interesting. If you are an art afficiando you've heard of the Gardner museum heist,  but you won't learn anything here. I've read a dozen or more magazine and news articles about the case over the years and this author really offered nothing new. That, and the fact that this book is nearly 10 years old  means that the info it contains is just outdated. One glaring example: the author spends chapters tying the heist to a famous Boston mobster who has since been captured and is now in prison. IF this gangster had ANYTHING to do with the heist, he would have bargained with the stolen artworks for a lighter sentence. He didn't, so, obviously, had nothing to do with the theft.  I do have to say the beginning chapters discussing the world of art theft and recovery were quite informative."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Fascinating book.

They stole a dozen masterpieces, including one Vermeer, three Rembrandts, and five Degas. But after thousands of leads\u2014and a $5 million reward\u2014none of the paintings have been recovered. Worth as much as $500 million, the missing masterpieces have become one of the nation's most extraordinary unsolved mysteries.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of famed art detective Harold Smith, reporter Ulrich Boser decided to take up the case. Exploring Smith's unfinished leads, Boser travels deep into the art underworld and comes across a remarkable cast of characters, including a brilliant rock 'n' roll thief, a gangster who professes his innocence in rhyming verse, and the enigmatic late Boston heiress Isabella Stewart Gardner herself.\r\n\r\nBoser becomes increasingly obsessed with the case and eventually uncovers startling new evidence about the identities of the thieves. A tale of art and greed, of obsession and loss, The Gardner Heist is as compelling as the stolen masterpieces themselves.\r\n\r\n\u201cBoser has produced a captivating portrait of the world\u2019s biggest unsolved art theft.\u201d Wall Street Journal", "asin": "0061451843", "rank": "38592", "city": "Boston", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51VjU%2BTkCcL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
