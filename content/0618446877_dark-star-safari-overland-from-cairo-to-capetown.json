Dark Star Safari did not disappoint! His style of writing, which includes the good, the bad and the ugly, makes you feel like you were on the trip with him. His journey across Africa definitely included all three. I enjoyed reading about his conversations with locals which add immensely to the experience. When I heard recently of Nadine Gordimer's death, I knew about her because of Paul's visit with her.

Seemed to show a genuine sense of desire to help alleviate poverty--yet how? No easy answers. Just plopping down money is not effective.The irony and hypocrisy: Author talked with young, single, female, Christian missionary on train in Mozambique. Author presented the caricature of ignorant Christian who is not able to answer difficult questions of the Bible. Author used obscure passages in Leviticus to show how ludicrous Bible belief was. Massive misrepresentation of church history, and biblical interpretation. Simplistic reductions and superficial biblical readings. Author stated this missionary \u201c\u2026was determined to bully Africans into abandoning their ancient pantheism\u2026\u201d (p. 433). The hypocrisy was delightful!--After Theroux had berated, cajoled, mocked, and bullied her for seeming hours. (To one of author's \"Bible problems,\" that of the rabbit chewing the cud, if he did even a little of research, would find, like (non-Christian) A.J. Jacobs found...Rabbits and chewing cud (Lev. 11.6). (Skeptics love this). But original: Rabbits re-eats its food. Rabbits excrete pellets and then eats pellets. (Jacobs, The Year of Living Biblically, 59)). Later Theroux called missionary an \u201ceasy target\u201d for thieves (after admitting to him that she was robbed). Again, the irony! She was an easy target for such an elitist, Western male with all the answers. Then, Author: because of her stubbornness, there was \u201cno light that I could shed\u201d (p. 431)\u2014oh the omniscient American author with all the answers! Who must impatiently deal with all the ignorant masses\u2014if only they could arrive at the \"truth\" as he! Susanna\u2026 \u201cwho believed herself to be in sole possession of the truth\u2026\u201d p. 435. The irony and hypocrisy never stops! In one sense simply delightful. In another sense, off-the-charts ridiculous. Other than all that\u2014great book! Great author."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Love Africa. love Theroux.

In the course of his epic and enlightening journey, he endures danger, delay, and dismaying circumstances.\r\n\r\nGauging the state of affairs, he talks to Africans, aid workers, missionaries, and tourists. What results is an insightful meditation on the history, politics, and beauty of Africa and its people, and \"a vivid portrayal of the secret sweetness, the hidden vitality, and the long-patient hope that lies just beneath the surface\" (Rocky Mountain News). In a new postscript, Theroux recounts the dramatic events of a return to Africa to visit Zimbabwe.\r\n\r\n\"Few recent books provide such a litany of Africa's ills, even as they make one fall in love with the continent.\" The Washington Post", "asin": "0618446877", "rank": "107579", "city": "Cairo", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51wqKje-SrL.jpg", "country": "Egypt", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
