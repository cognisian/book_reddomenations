This one presents us with a lot of Norwegian WW II history, and some similar names that requires that the reader's brain be always engaged and well-exercised to keep them all straight.  My edition included a map of Olso, which I frequently referred back to to place in my mind exactly where we kept moving around to and from.  Some American readers used to the banality of SK and JKR may most likely find this grey cell stimulus a bit too tiring, but the characters are so alive, the sights and sounds so fresh and real and tactile that this one again kept me burning the midnight oil well past midnight."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Multiple personalities - revenge - for the greater good - who is considered a traitor or hero to an unforgiving nation"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a captivating story.  I am new to this author and his writing is addictive.  Great mystery with believable storylines and very believable characters.

I have never liked flashbacks (movies or books) It did stop,so I was okay with that part. I am confused on other reviews. Author is from Norway,book is about a Norwegian detective. Why would some people comment about Cities ,people and places being spelled in its natural language. Sure not easy names. But try and guess and then move on to story.Looking forward to reading The Snowman."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I learned much Norwegian history here--mainly all a the clamor of Norway resisting Nazi occupation was so much hot air.  Norwegians enlisted in Hitler's army, fought for it and after Germany lost the nation tried to sweep this fact under the  carpet.  The plot takes us back in forth in time : WW2, the present and it weaves through people and streets and squares with those long unfamiliar names---great if you're from Oslo not so good if you're from Philly. Snowman was a more compelling read from the Harry Hole series."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The Redbreast is a crime novel taking place during both the second world war and Norway at the turn of the millennium. During the second world war we are introduced to a small group of Norwegian Waffen-SS volunteers; Daniel, Gudbrand, Hallgrim and Edvard fight alongside each other begrudgingly in 1944 until they go their separate ways. Years later with much of what happened in the trenches a hazy jumbled memory their fates are again entwined in a mystery that forces Harry Hole to dive headfirst into the world of neo-nazis and the illegal arms trade.In The Redbreast Nesbo's writing and storytelling ability improve significantly.  The plot is complex and the scope vast. Nesbo masterfully juggles two eras without skipping a beat and manages to pace the two merging stories perfectly. I did struggle with the war scenes as I feel Nesbo assumed that his readers would mainly be Norwegians well acquainted with Norway's history in the war. I also felt that major loose ends were not dealt with towards the end of the book."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I found it extremely difficult to get through.
