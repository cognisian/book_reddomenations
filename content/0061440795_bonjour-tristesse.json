To read it is to fall in love again."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "\"Bonjour Tristesse\"  was a timely book in the 1950's, when rebellious teenagers were a popular concern in the United States.  Written by a teenager, its principal character was a seventeen-year-old girl named Cecile, who could have been a poster child for a style of lax parenting that 1950's America found abhorrent.  The book had the appeal of a cautionary tale.The novel is sparely written,  and author Francois Sagan shows a keen understanding of psychological conflicts.  The triangle of conflict concerns Cecile, her permissive and promiscuous father Raymonde, and  Anne, the woman who hopes to marry Raymonde and provide stability to both of their lives.At its best, the book is like a diary of a teenaged girl's conflicted impulses to become an adult on one hand, but to remain a carefree \"friend\" of her father on the other.  The brittleness of Anne is a threat, and so Cecile sets about destroying her, even as she conceals her motivations from herself.\"Bonjour Tristesse\" was made into a not entirely successful film by Otto Preminger.  Preminger failed to give enough emphasis to the key conflict between Anne and Cecile,  glossing over mistakes made by Anne (such as locking Cecile in her room), and portraying her as a victim.  Because of the mores of the time, Cecile's experiments with sexuality were made to seem more innocent than they were, and Cecile's previous stay in a convent school  isn't made clear.In today's climate of books produced for a youth market, \"Bonjour Tristesse\" probably wouldn't make a dent."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A fine novel, written in easy to understand (french) prose."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Peachy, wonderful, fabulous, couldn't live without it!!!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This novel by Fran\u00e7oise Sagan is much more than sadness as title implies. It is the story of a young girl living with his father and spending a nice vacation in the C\u00f4te d'Azur when someone comes to alter this subtle balance. It is a rather short book but also entertaining and very well written. Characters are complex, as the human relationships depicted by Sagan in the novel. Very recommendable and especially in French since it's not difficult to follow if you have some knowledge of the language."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "GREAT BOOK FOR TEENAGE GIRL"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Bonjour Tristesse\u2014Hello Sadness is a 1954 classic that I had just read. It describes the story of 17-year-old C\u00e9cile during summer vacation on the Riviera with her 40-year-old widowed father, Raymond, and his 29-year-old, vacuous, but kind mistress, Elsa.C\u00e9cile spent ten years in a convent boarding school before returning to her father. Raymond worked in publicity, was charismatic, self-indulgent, and promiscuous. He kept young women for six months before moving on to his next conquest. C\u00e9cile, a cynic, loved life with her father who didn\u2019t appear to make a fuss at her failing grades. A positive was Raymond loved his daughter, was approachable and accessible; however, he was too permissive and didn\u2019t set rules and boundaries. C\u00e9cile\u2019 enjoyed a whirlwind of adult parties and drinking with Raymond and his friends. He referred to C\u00e9cile as his \u2018little partner in crime.\u2019The three, C\u00e9cile, Raymond and Elsa spent a happy summer on the Mediterranean. C\u00e9cile had met passionate Cyril, a college student who appeared enamored of her. Yet C\u00e9cile felt the shadow of their peaceful and idyllic summer was invaded when Anne Larsen arrived. Anne worked in fashions in Paris, and was a friend of C\u00e9cile\u2019s late mother.C\u00e9cile admired 40-year-old, Anne, but felt inadequate in her presence. Anne was intelligent, sophisticated and cultured. She strongly disapproved of C\u00e9cile\u2019s behavior and grades. She demanded C\u00e9cile\u2019 study for her next exam in the fall.C\u00e9cile was not happy with how Anne had begun to rearrange their lives. Anne controlled her relationship with Cyril, and wheedled her way into Raymond\u2019s life. In no time, Anne seized Raymond\u2019s attentions from Elsa. With Elsa gone, love bloomed overnight between Raymond and Anne. Secretly, C\u00e9cile became sexually active with Cyril.Raymond announced to C\u00e9cile that he and Anne would marry when they returned to Paris.C\u00e9cile believed Anne would shatter their life of decadence, fun and merriment for a more controlled and cultured life. C\u00e9cile refused to accept this. She became a master schemer at manipulating her father, Cyril and Elsa, which wreaked havoc on what might have been bonjour bonheur.I loved Sagan\u2019s character Anne\u2019s view on serial womanizers: \u201c\u2026they are no longer attractive or in good form. They can\u2019t drink anymore and they still hanker after women. Only then they have to pay heavily and lower their standards, to escape from their loneliness. They grow sentimental and querulous.\u201dI enjoyed this well written, short novel. The characters were well fleshed out and believable. I gave this book four stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I don't understand the reviews written by people who didn't enjoy it based on it not being \"shocking\" for their time period.  I have read several saying \"oh it was probably such and such in the 50s but boring to me\" or some-such.  Nonsense.  Is it a product of its time and place?  Naturally.  And naturally our social mores have evolved since the expectations of this novel's contemporary audience.  A good reader, however, recognizes the setting into which the novel was introduced and enjoys it (or doesn't) based on its own merits.Sagan's style has much to recommend it.  It is thoughtful and the protagonism - not just in this book but thorughout her career - is compelling because the characters are complex in their simplicity.  Meaning, they are generally young women un-self-consciously direct about their flaws as well as passions, and betraying themselves when they do not truly comprehend themselves.  It is a tricky thing to accomplish as a writer & Sagan does so deftly.  Her narrative voice intertwines with her characters', leaving the reader with the sense that every novel is really about some element of Sagan herself, but with enough distance to accept that it's not exactly a mirror.Just as a subjective aside, the time/place element is always a treat to me, as I noted above this is to be read as literature, not as a current pop phenomenon.  In a different way:  Anne Bronte's \"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\" was shocking in its time, and was suppressed because of its bold feminisms.  Sagan was not suppressed, even if history tells us French society was \"shocked\" at the candor with which the female youth expresses her sexual freedom.  One can lay certain credit at the feet of feminists like Bronte and Sagan, for the undeniable ways in which they helped shape their societies."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A classic that I had somehow never gotten around to and very glad that I finally did; very evocative of a certain era and mindset- (and in some ways an enduring one) as well as simply interesting; the character depictions by the main character are incisive and beautifully drawn, as well as subject to shifts in perspective because, as an adolescent, her maturity shape-shifts as she encounters various challenges.  The intelligence of the main character is never cloying, but rather deeply interesting, (and of course all the more so as much of the immense popularity of the book is the fascination with Sagan's age when she wrote it (the same as the main character).  The story gives one an open door into a certain world, at a certain time, from a certain person.
