In the winter/spring of 1942 Field Marshal Rommel is close to overrunning Cairo and the Suez Canal. His success is believed to be due to very accurate intelligence being fed to him by a spy or spies close to British military HQ.  The plot and the writing are very good.  The characters are well developed and it\u2019s all put together nicely. It\u2019s also well researched and historically spot on accurate, and as you would expect with a  novel by a quality author, it's properly edited.This is not your conventional war/espionage thriller though. The spy catcher has no espionage experience, nor has he had any security training. He becomes proficient in his new job by reading old spy novels and other reference material.  And, because of a twist of fate he\u2019s not even who he is supposed to be. One character is a deserter turned black market arms dealer. He\u2019s a slick con artist who uses his talents to create a top secret fictitious commando type unit called Special Desert Team Three which in turn enables him to freely roam the area. His band of a dozen or so deserters scavenge the battlefield for guns, ammo and small equipment. His most valued and trusted team member is an enterprising German Africa Corps deserter who disguises himself as South African soldier. He even manages to commandeer a coveted private office in the British HQ building in Cairo and hires a full colonel\u2019s wife as a secretary who unwittingly helps  him maneuver around the system.This is balanced blend of subtle wit in a serious and deadly war setting that only a highly talented author like Len Deighton could create. A solid four star rating and highly recommended. A must read if you are a fan of the genre."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Some interesting historical facts whichis a good learning opportunity for peoplenot up on the history of the areaKeeps you interested , good read"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This one is a puzzler; for the first three quarters of the book I would swear it wasn't written by Deighton, whom I consider as great a spy novelist as LeCarre, and I can't give higher praise than that.
