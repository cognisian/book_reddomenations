Racism, disillusionment, free will vs predestination -- Ali tackles some huge topics without breaking a sweat.This is one of the few books I've read twice. I'll admit, the first time I read it I just didn't get it. But the second time I took my time, and discovered the little details of how well told this story is. Nazneen basically never got to be a teenager...and out of nowhere she explodes and blooms and embraces life in a way her husband and fate never would allow. Hasina is the patron saint of getting kicked around and never truly giving up hope. And even the husband Chanu is a complex character -- for all of his faults and genuinely pigheaded behavior, he's kinda stuck in a trap of expectations.The very last scene is overbearingly cornball and nearly derails the whole darn enterprise, but I get why it's there. Still was such a silly way to end a very moving and serious novel."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Well written book.  It was assigned for reading in my class.

A novel that\u2019s multi-continental, richly detailed and elegantly crafted.\u201d \u2014Curtis Sittenfeld, author of Sisterland\r\n\r\nAfter an arranged marriage to Chanu, a man twenty years older, Nazneen is taken to London, leaving her home and heart in the Bangladeshi village where she was born. Her new world is full of mysteries. How can she cross the road without being hit by a car (an operation akin to dodging raindrops in the monsoon)? What is the secret of her bullying neighbor Mrs. Islam? What is a Hell's Angel? And how must she comfort the na\u00efve and disillusioned Chanu?\r\n\r\nAs a good Muslim girl, Nazneen struggles to not question why things happen. She submits, as she must, to Fate and devotes herself to her husband and daughters. Yet to her amazement, she begins an affair with a handsome young radical, and her erotic awakening throws her old certainties into chaos.\r\n\r\nMonica Ali\u2019s splendid novel is about journeys both external and internal, where the marvelous and the terrifying spiral together.", "asin": "0743243315", "rank": "110176", "city": "London", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51W6004JQML.jpg", "country": "England", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
