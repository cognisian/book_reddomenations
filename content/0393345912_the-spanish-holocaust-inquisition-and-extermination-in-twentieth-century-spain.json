Of course like virtually every account of the SCW, this one tends to \"favor\" the Republican side. Wish someone somewhere would give us an account from the Nationalist side. Still a very good read. Anyone interested in the SCW should read this book."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "By many standards, Francisco Franco, the Spanish dictator in power from 1939-1975 is a forgotten murderer and despot. By virtue of his longevity in office and the increasing irrelevancy of Spain as a major international power, his regime seemed to become more of a relic; a lingering curio from another era with a bemedaled, pot-bellied, prancing buffoon in the seat of power. Yet, the catalogue of his crimes is vast and rivals the depredations of Pol Pot and Stalin, but is second to those of his supporters in Nazi Germany, both in terms of scale and mechanization, though perhaps not in brutality.To refresh and reveal to the annals of history these overlooked and/or submerged murders, Paul Preston has assembled this prodigious record of Francoist regime crimes. The catalogue is so extensive it's oftentimes overwhelming. The utterly gratuitous and generally vengeful murders, usually conducted by feudal landlords and their mercenary minions, adds another revolting dimension to the crimes. Yet, Franco and his fascist paladins reveled in the carnage. True enough that Francoist Spain eventually became a minor pariah on the international scene, yet justice was never administered by the UN or other nations, even including those of the Warsaw Pact.Because of the encylopedic nature of this history, it's sometimes difficult reading. The book strives for (and succeeds) status as an academic reference. Nonetheless, even a cursory reading is useful, especially as context for the Civil War: Franco's African Army pioneered the methods used domestically overseas, a fact well known to his opponents at the time of his rebellion. Plus, the Nazi and Italian Fascist regimes were able to refine many military techniques (e.g., terror bombing) used to great avail during WW-2 during this conflict.In the final analysis, the fact that a book like this one is needed is testimony to the fact that, as Dostoevsky once wrote in \"The House of the Dead\", \"Man is a creature that can get used to anything and I think that is the best definition of him\". It seems that forgetting is a convenient means of accomplishing that end and Preston's book is a good corrective for those who are determined to remember."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a very meticulously reaearched book on a very interesting and seldom explored subject which he notes is partially due to reluctance of Spanish government to allow researchers much access to governmental files regarding the Francoist regime. My grandpa was a young chuld survivor of the Spanish civil war and I showed him both the illustrations and the subject of the book and he cried - in a good way because he had not found much literature on the array of atrocities committed particularly by Franco's Legion on the citizens of northern and all together civilians of Spain. He does a good job at explaining the various factions and takes time to have a glossary exploring and explaining at the beginning."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The brutality and senselessness of the killing comes alive in Prof Paul Prestons words. An often forgotten aspect of the Spanish Civil War is now in the open and under scrutiny for the public."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A brilliant book with extremely realistic stories of the true horrors of the Spanish civil war which nobody dared to record in spainduring the Franco regime and possibly after his death."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Do not confuse this as an effort to objectively present a history of the Spanish war and its dreadful human cost.  The author is an apologist for the left, and the bias in the book is overwhelming to my mind.  While the violence on both sides is well documented, and I'm sure well researched, invariably the Nationalist atrocities are presented as without justification, while the Republican events are twisted to somehow appear as natural reactions to various alleged persecutions.  Additionally, as others have pointed out, the tedium of the book makes it extremely difficult to read in extended sessions.  I was eager to read the book, and was quite disappointed."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "If he accomplished nothing else (and he did) Preston's greatest contribution to understanding the tragedy of the Spanish Civil War was to provide clear distinctions between the largely programmatic genocide practiced by the Nationalists and the ad hoc (though certainly murderous) atrocities committed by the Republican side.  The clear implication is that Franco's brutal, systematic campaign of murder and terror evolved into an equally murderous and brutal dictatorship since his was an institutionalized brutality.  The Republicans had no such carefully constructed system of murder; consequently, they committed fewer of them."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A thorough description of the evolution of the Spanish Civil War starting with the 2nd Republic. Preston makes an unbiased recount with tons of notes and bibliography. A much needed information of a period of the Spanish history that has been mislead or hushed in the official narrative.
