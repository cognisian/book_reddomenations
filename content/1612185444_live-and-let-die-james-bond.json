James Bond comes to America, Harlem, then Florida, then Jamaica.  It is a decent spy action thriller.  I have never been a very big fan of James Bond movies, but this novel seems, pretty much like a literary version of a James Bond film.The book was written by a British author in 1954.  Coincidentally, 1954 is the same year of the historic United States Supreme Court Decision \"Brown versus Board of Education\".  So what?  The modern Civil Rights movement was just gaining traction in America.  This novel is more consistent with the pre modern Civil Rights viewpoint.  James Bond, as a white person, does battle with American black organized criminals.  There is a LOT of dated ethnic nomenclature and stereotyping that could offend some readers.  I do not believe in censorship or rewriting of novels such as this.  I actually find a novel such as this provides much fuel for inner contemplation.  Just be advised there is a lot of ethnic references in this novel.Personally, the above observation aside, I think this is a somewhat better written novel than the first James Bond novel, \"Casino Royale\".  There is a lot of descriptive narrative that I felt was more sophisticated than the prior novel.  This novel can be read without having read the first novel.  There is one character, an American, Felix Leiter, who makes an appearance in this novel, who had also been in the first novel.  Obviously, \"M\" and  Miss Moneypenny are ongoing characters.When I was a youth growing up in America in the 1950s and 1960s, I was not allowed to read James Bond novels.  I had friends of my age who did read them.  All they talked about was the sexual aspects of these novels.  By today's standards, I do not find these novels are not to be particularly salacious.  But as a parent and grandparent, I would be very careful about allowing a child or grandchild to read these novels.In summary, I am glad I read this novel, I liked it, but did not love it,  I would not read it again without good cause.  Thank You..."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "the blurbs had it right, of course. You won\u2019t want to put it down.

Here I am trying to buy a book and somehow I ended up with a bizzare edition of a classic spy novel.  It is called \"Live And Let Die (Spanish Edition)\", yet it's an e-book in English.  Also it seem to be an extremely edited version and not the original (some words changed either due to translation or political correctness ?).the worst part of it is Amazon is TOO LAZY to even put in a decent description.  The only good thing is it was only 99 cents, but on the other hand it's 99 cents into the trash.Buying ebooks on Amazon ...
