Scott Fitzgerald is a very well written American classic novel. This fine piece of literature is worth the read. My review of this book is four stars. The Great Gatsby is the first F. Scott Fitzgerald book I have read, and it has made an impression on me. This book has caused me to look into more novels written by him.  The Great Gatsby was published in April of 1925, almost 93 years ago. Yet this book is still read and praised in school and libraries across America. And even had several movies dedicated to it. Fitzgerald's style is mostly realistic fiction. He often approaches the darker, less glamorous aspects of human lifestyles in the 1920s, issues prevalent in today\u2019s time worldwide. Like alcoholism, marital issues, scandal, and the effects of wealth.  The book details the later life of a wealthy man who goes by the name Jay Gatsby through the eyes of the narrator Nick Carraway. Who moves to the West Egg, a place in Long Island, New York. Nick happens to be Jay\u2019s neighbor and soon discovers Jay is in love with his cousin Daisy. But Daisy so happens to be married to Tom Buchanan. Causing a fervid love triangle. A common plot we see in books today. The way the book is told makes it original with another character in the story narrating about the main character. The story is authentic and was geographically accurate.  Another reason I enjoyed the book was the well thought out characters. While there is no significant character development, the characters have very different personalities from one another. Since the characters have very distinct natures relating to them can be a challenge.  After I finished the book, I discovered a moral. That money can\u2019t buy your dream of true love. Since Jay couldn\u2019t marry Daisy, he became wealthy and thought to woo her with extravagant parties. But his money couldn\u2019t buy him a future with Daisy. I recommend this book to people who have a soft spot for an American classic, tragic love story. Or if you're interested in something new, this is the novel for you as well. This is a nice read that will not take much of your time and will leave you pondering of what could have been."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The product is good.
