The Grandfather, who is a career grave robber, hits the frost line while trying to dig up his latest corpse and proclaims the \"season\" (the grave robbing season) over. A visit to a funeral home to pay respects to his daughter-in-law's deceased father offers another brilliant comedic moment, on par with Stephen Leacock's famed visit to a bank.Unfortunately, the comedy gives way too often for Basilieres' personal exposition on separatism and French/English relations which seem artificially hammered into the narrative. In that, he offers little new in the debate.He also seems to play a bit too much with the history of the October Crisis and ends up confusing the reader familiar with Quebec history. The book starts off before the Laporte/Cross kidnappings. Basilieres' then introduces a PQ premier who you assume is Rene Levesque. Since Levesque took power during the late '70s, you assume the author has moved up the story in time. But apparently not. We're still back in 1970 although Robert Bourassa, leader of the Liberal party, was actually the premier at that time. Unfortunately, what started as a novel that promised a hard biting tact and a dark humor that holds nothing as sacred suddenly begins to look like an author pulling his punches. Kudos, however, to Basilieres' for working into the story the theft of Brother Andre's heart, which actually took place in 1973.Despite these short comings, it's a rather good read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Crafting a delightfully macabre comic novel incorporating nods to PQ premier/homicidal motorist Rene Levesque, faith healer Brother Andre, dastardly doctor Ewan Cameron (of \"In the Sleep Room\" fame) and the October Crisis is not an easy task, but Michel Basilieres pulls it off with great aplomb. It's hard to see how Basilieres will top this stunning first novel, but until he does \"Black Bird\" provides much to entertain the erudite reader, and should particularly amuse those familiar with Montreal's geography and history.

Their world is dark and hard, but alive with hope and expectation. When one of the eldest, an Anglo Montrealer, dies at the hand of one of the youngest, a militant separatist, so begins a year of turmoil and change that culminates in the October Crisis.\r\n\r\nGrave-robbing Grandfather consorts with prostitutes and mad scientists, loses an eye and gains a new vision. His disenchanted wife bonds with his canny pet crow. Mother sleeps her grief away through the seasons, while Father ineffectively schemes to get rich quick. Meanwhile, their twin children, Marie and Jean-Baptiste, find their personal ambitions clashing with their public actions as they derail each other at every turn.\r\n\r\nIn this wholly original novel alive with misfortune and magic, Michel Basili\u00e8res uncovers a Montreal not seen in any other English-Canadian novel: a forgotten blue-collar neighbourhood in between the two solitudes. Gothic, outrageous, yet tender and wise, Black Bird is as liberating as the dreams of its wayward characters, and as gripping as the insurgencies that split its heart.\r\n", "asin": "0676975283", "rank": "4903249", "city": "Montreal", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51VcC5Wtv3L.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
