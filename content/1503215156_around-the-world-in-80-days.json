The imagination of Jules Verne is something that every sci-fi fan must explore at some point in their life.  He envisioned so many of the technologies that we take for granted today and used them to create worlds that are rich with legendary adventures, edge of your seat  suspense and characters that you will never forget.PLEASE ... if you are going to read Jules Verne, do NOT just buy any copy that you come across.  Jules Verne wrote in French and, if you can't read French fluently, you must find an edition that was translated by a true expert in Verne's writing and style.  Poor translations are literally filled with omissions, errors and shabby translations that completely destroy the subtle humor and style of Jules Verne.  Three experts that are often highly recommended by Jules Verne advocates are: Stanford Luce, Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter.This particular edition was the 1873 translation by George Makepeace Towle.  Towle was a 19th century contemporary of Jules Verne and is remembered for this particularly outstanding translation of Around the World In Eighty Days.  You may find the 19th century English grammar and syntax a bit challenging, but it is well worth the effort."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "i bought this classic for make my english reading better..that was easy to read and fun..i have all series from great illustrated classics.."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent book by an amazing author.

It is one of Verne's most acclaimed works. \r\n\r\nThe story starts in London on Tuesday, October 1, 1872. Fogg is a rich English gentleman living in solitude. Despite his wealth, Fogg lives a modest life with habits carried out with mathematical precision. Very little can be said about his social life other than that he is a member of the Reform Club. Having dismissed his former valet, James Foster, for bringing him shaving water at 84 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C) instead of 86 \u00b0F (30 \u00b0C), Fogg hires a Frenchman by the name of Jean Passepartout as a replacement. \r\n\r\nAt the Reform Club, Fogg gets involved in an argument over an article in The Daily Telegraph stating that with the opening of a new railway section in India, it is now possible to travel around the world in 80 days. He accepts a wager for \u00a320,000 (equal to about \u00a31.6 million today) from his fellow club members, which he will receive if he makes it around the world in 80 days. \r\n\r\nAccompanied by Passepartout, he leaves London by train at 8:45 P.M. on Wednesday, October 2, 1872, and is due back at the Reform Club at the same time 80 days later, Saturday, December 21, 1872.", "asin": "1503215156", "rank": "23150", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XOe02htCL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
