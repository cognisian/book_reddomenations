An ode to Miami and the lush life of a family living near the water, the characters are so fully drawn that I thought about them in my off hours - wondering how they were. Even though I had a vague memory of what happens at the end of the novel, it still touched me. Very well done, Ms Daniel. I'm sure there will be a fourth reading some time in my future."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a lovely novel.  When I read the first few chapters it I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I decided to hold on and I am so glad I did.  Stiltsville is the story of a marriage.  How simple, and how wonderful, is that.  The main character through whose eyes we see the action is Frances, first a girlfriend then a wife.  She is a lovely creation - I liked her so much.  And I liked her husband, Dennis.  It might sound odd for me to say this is a page-turner, but it is.  You just want to see what is going to happen to them as they go through life.  The ending was deeply moving.  You believe so fully in the marriage that it's hard to see it coming to an end.  But Frances is a strong woman.  We should all be as strong and gracious and thankful as she is when tragedy strikes."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "While this novel was sweet and loving, it was very disconnected and as one reviewer said boring at times. I read the whole book and was not sure at times why the author would move back and forth in time to explain stuff, and she tended to almost repeat herself. None of the characters were fully developed and in some cases no explanation on how events were resolve. A perfect example was Bette, she runs off on her wedding day to be with an woman. Next thing you know all are happy and Bette is living with a woman,  this was the 1970s.Oh I kept on waiting to see what would happen next, and the last part of the book was very sad and I wish the author would have in the end explained how she researched all her information on the deadly disease."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "extremely well written book and I love the premise....would highly recommend it. I love the characters."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "There is a strong suspense in this calm book--the suspense of ordinary life--embodied in the fragile stilt house that the characters inhabit in times of leisure and pleasure in Biscayne Bay, a boat ride away from their home in Miami. The suspense only builds as you come to respect, and fear for, the narrator's decency and endurance, as it is threatened by life's hazards and by her own natural desires. She is strong, sensuous, competent, and practical, and yet the author makes us see her, and her familiy's, fragility at every turn. The shells we build for ourselves like sea creatures will someday wash away, without us in them. But that does not dull the shine and wonder of our efforts."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent read and love story"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "dark and depressing. wouldn't recommend this read."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "As a person interested in Miami as a character, and the stilt houses in Biscayne bay being part of Miami's history, I was happy to finally read this book.  There is a sequel about other characters in a stilt house that I had read first, but the two novels stand alone.  This is a story of a marriage over time and the challenges of having a \"vacation home\" that is only reachable by boat.  Enjoyed it immensely."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I met the author at a writers conference and bought her book based upon her warm personality.  The first thing I noticed while reading it was how consistently interesting the writing was, even when there was little \"action\" occurring.  I'd read 25 pages and never be bored, anxious for the next 25.This is the story of the seasons of a woman's life, from meeting, courting and marrying her husband, Dennis,  through child rearing,  the empty nest, job changes,  middle age, and finally, the sudden onset of her husband's ALS.I'm glad to have spent the time with it, and am glad to recommend it, particularly to women,  who will identify the Frances, the narrator."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The last half of the book , I couldn't put down.
