Not for everyone. Mostly historical fact,well researched, but also a tiny bit of fiction (it's filed as such in the library) and some writer's exposition where the author details his own experiences and obsessions in researching and writing the story. I've never read anything like it. I learned some things from the non-fiction part of the story and I think that, if expanded as a fictional novel based on fact it would have been fascinating in that format also.  I suppose the authors own interjections are what would turn people off from this but I found it helped in portraying  the humanity of the characters since the writer cares very deeply about what actually happened. Very unique. Highly recommended. Even the title is fascinating."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Pristine condition. Very happy withy this purchase."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Such a terrific, smart, clever, engaging book, and accurate too. I wouldn't characterize it as historical fiction be\u00e7ause the history, while delivered in an unorthodox way, is pretty sound, as in identifying facts as separate from fiction. So maybe it's history and fiction, which gets closer to the truth. But perhaps history as fiction really captures it.  I say that because, as someone who has  a better than average knowledge of WWII and the events leading up to it, this book does a great job of covering the facts pertaining to WWII and the \"final solution.\"  For those who don't know much about WWII, this is book is a good start. To top it off, it's a compelling mystery with events rarely covered by standard treatment.  I highly recommend this outstanding book."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Gift for a friend.

I used to think that, as a general rule, I do not like these postmodern novels where the author inserts himself into the narrative and blurs the line between memoir and fiction.  Recent books, however, are forcing me to rethink that position.  Ben Lerner used the technique successfully in 10:04 as did Michael Chabon in Moonglow.  Now I find that Laurent Binet has done the same with HHhH.Superficially, this novel shares something with Chabon\u2019s.  Both are essentially works of historical fiction; however, Chabon hues much closer to memoir and he places himself in his novel only rarely.  In HHhH, Mr. Binet is a constant presence in a novel whose main story is one with which he has no direct connection other than a passion for what he wants to tell.  His disconnect leaves us with a novel of two threads: the history, and Binet\u2019s writing of that history.The history here is the story of the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Prague by two men, a Czech named Jan Kubis and a Slovak named Jozef Gabcik.  Heydrich is best known as the mind behind the Final Solution as formalized at the Wannsee Conference.  In fact, he was known as one of the most brilliant and ruthless of the Nazis (HHhH = German for \u201cHimmler\u2019s brain is called Heydrich\u201d).  His assassination was the first major takedown of a Nazi elite during World War II and a fascinating story of espionage.As to Mr. Binet\u2019s presence in the novel; well, at first I feared that it was going to be distracting.  Instead, he became a guide.  Helped by the fact that this is not one of the most well-known stories of World War II, we are almost able to participate with Mr. Binet as he conducts his research, chooses what he is going to leave in or throw out, and basically defines for us what he feels an historical novel should be.  It turns out, his view is pretty bland: facts, few reconstructions of conversations, and direct description of action.  Ultimately, it is Mr. Binet\u2019s presence that enlivens what could have been a pretty flat undertaking and drives us through what turns out to be a very interesting tale.In the end, I don\u2019t think my opinion of these \u201cself-aware\u201d novels has much changed.  I can\u2019t see this technique working as a general approach to fiction.  That said, in the hands of a brilliant writer with the right material, it\u2019s a technique that I can\u2019t now deny has its appeals.  Mr. Binet has certainly made the most of it in this wonderful novel."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great description, accurately researched and mixed with literary, cultural and historical comments.
