It is not what happens to the characters, but what they say and feel about it, that matters. I deeply dislike the hero, yet the author uses him to express profound ideas and thoughts. Sometimes, the world of \u201cBeer in the Snooker Club\u201d seems very far away, but at others, it seems all too close. The book is often very depressing, full of discontent and even despair, but at the same time it is generously thought-provoking."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I was drawn to this book because of its relative obscurity. Who says to themselves, \"I really want to read a book about Egypt in the 1950s,\" unless you have some sort of tie to the area. But if you do ask yourself that question and discover this book, you'll likely be pleased with what you find.The book is charming and immersive. You get a good feel for the area and Ghali makes you feel right at home in his world. This was his only book, which is a bummer, but it's a delightfully entertaining tale.This is a good book for people in search of something that has a little quirk or is out of the ordinary. I really enjoyed my time with this book."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "For people knowledgeable on Egypt's history post WWII, this will be an easy story line to understand.  For those who do not like history, the plot will be confusing or not make any sense.The story is about three upper-class Egyptians who have been educated in England.  They speak English and live in a plush neighborhood of Cairo.  They have servants and drive nice cars.  Well, perhaps at one time they did, but the Suez Canal conflict really put a damper on a lot of Egyptians' lives.  It was a war fought by the lower-class.And this story deals a lot about class, minority status (the two male protagonists are Copts), and Egypt's treatment by England and Israel.  King Farouk had been dethroned in 1952 by his rebellious free officers, of whom the leader was General Neguib, who later resigned and placed Nasser in command. Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, who became the next leader of Egypt. Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal in 1956, much to the West's chagrin, and later that same year. Israel invaded the Suez Canal, with help from England and France. The canal was closed to shipping until 1957.  The conflict weakened England's influence over Egypt. Nassar was seen as a national hero to the Egyptians.  He was a Socialist who sought financial help by the Soviet Union, although he never let Egypt fall under the Soviet sphere.All these political events come up in this novel.  Anti-colonialism, anti-Imperialism, worker's rights, religious freedom, class conflict, sexism,  Jewish political strength, all make their appearance in this novel.  Religion as a major factor is absent.  Ghali's experience in England in his own life play a big role in the three major players. Egypt's youth is trying to build its own niche of the post WWII and Suez Canal crisis, yet being educated in England is still a coveted status only the wealthy can afford.  Waguih Ghali uses many incidents of his own life to bring life to these characters and by sending a message as well.  What he shows is an Egypt suffering from an identity crisis, furtively wanting its own identity and respect in the world without being subjugated to a second-class political power.The title of this book is an allegory to this struggle of Egypt's younger generation, and it plays well with smart dialogue and emotion.  My one complaint is that the French phrases that some of the Egyptians say are not translated into English.  Luckily for me, I understand basic French, but for those who do not, and for those who do not understand the political background of this novel, may be left confused and bored and not finish the book.This book was published in 1964 in English.  Yet the political message once again applies to today's Egyptians as they once again find themselves in civil war and a new identity among the Arab-Muslim world."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Waguih Ghali's semi-autobiographical novel, originally published in 1964 or thereabouts, has charmed critics for decades, and deservedly so.  \"Snooker Club\" tells the story of Ram, a charming wastrel born to an aristocratic family of limited financial means who struggles to find his place in Nasser's Egypt.  An ugly comic novel, \"Snooker Club\" indicts European attitudes toward Egypt along with the Egyptians who seek to maintain their privileged status at the expense of their countrymen.I had to do a fair amount of reading to become familiar with Ghali's Egypt.  President Nasser had been a key player in the nationalistic coup that toppled Egypt's monarchy - the crown that had effectively ceded control of Egypt to Britain.  (I am sure I'm missing vast swaths of key information here.)  To say that Nasser did not care too much for the civil liberties of the Egyptian people is at best an understatement, but he was a strong voice for Egyptian nationalism.  And so it is no surprise that a young man such as Ram might wonder at his place in the world - there is much to admire, and even love, in Europe, but as an Egyptian the European lifestyle is not quite true.  But he is also the kind of man who is expected by his class to play croquet at the club and wile away his days drinking and splashing in the pool, served by countrymen who will never have his money or connections.  So Ram really isn't \"Egyptian,\" either.Ghali's novel is unsparing in its contempt and has been compared favorably to \"Catcher in the Rye.\"  I enjoyed Ghali's book more, but I can't say that I'm eager to dive back into this short novel - the withering humor takes its toll after a while.  I also need to do some reading about Egypt before re-reading this novel, as I owe it to Ghali to understand his world better than I currently do.Accordingly, I freely admit that I may revisit the novel to add a fifth star - I fear that my lack of knowledge caused a fair amount of this book to go over my head.  I strongly recommend it as an eye-opening read and an introduction to a part of the world that I should understand better.  That's pretty high praise for a novel."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "While there is some attempt by this book\u2019s publisher to compare its protagonist Ram, to Holden Caulifield. While Ram does have a few character traits as Holden, such as a certain aimlessness, high intelligence, and a smart mouth, it seems like a poor comparison at best. Set it in the 1950\u2019s, its certainly far removed from contemporary Egypt when a Coptic man can have a relationship with a Jewish woman, even if they can never get married. Ram, an educated, but unemployed middle/upper middle class Coptic Christian man is at a standstill. He can\u2019t marry the woman he loves. He isn\u2019t interested in working (or at least not very hard). His mother nags him for not having a job or a wife. We get some insight into what led him here and ay least a hint at the end that he may settle/settle down into a kind of respectable life.While I know a little about the time, I felt like if I knew much more, it would have helped. My review copy lacked the introduction, which might have helped. I\u2019m glad this book is back in print and hope more new and old translations of other Egyptian writing will make it in the U.S. market, a place sorely lacking in translated work."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Did you know that there\u2019s an entire literary genre of the over-educated-under-ambitious characters? Ram Bey, the main character in Beer in the Snooker Club is one.  The story was written in 1964, and takes place right around the 50s when Britain had released its grip on Egypt from exploitation. King Farouk was dethroned and a democratically elected president Nasser would take over. Egypt clearly hadn\u2019t rid of itself form the Turkish influence, let alone the British. Words like \u2018Bey\u2019 or  \u2018Effendi\u2019 are all words used in the book, and they are all superficial titles of respect. Well, superficial now, to me. Back then people took this stuff seriously. We\u2019re all Americans now: first name only regardless of who you are.  Ram Bey should have come to America. The greatest capitalist system in the World with no real class hierarchy\u2014a dream of socialism, which is what Ram Bey\u2019s Jewish amore, Edna, tries to convert him to.

It's semi-autobiographical, following along Ghali's life timeline, and Ram, the main character, has a background very similar to Ghali. He's a Copt (a Christian religion), born into a wealthy family (whose gains Ram considers to be ill-gotten), and educated in an English school. It's a juxaposition of many things: Egypt was (and remains) a primarily Muslim country, Ram never seemed to be able to get and hold a good job, and Egypt was undergoing a national pride revival and considered English-educated to be Anglophiles and viewed them somewhat suspiciously.It was an interesting read to me because the of http://www.amazon.com/The-Map-Love-A-Novel/dp/0385720114, one of my favorite books, also set in Egypt, but in the early 1900s and 1970s, from colonial rule to independence. Beer in the Snooker Club connects some of the timeframe and events between the two time periods.Ram's conflicts are quite clearly clearly delineated - and Ghali also uses some very sharp wit, excoriating some of the practices of the time. \"When an Englishman wants a new market for his adulterated goods, he sends a missionary to teach the natives the gospel of peace.\"Knowing that the author committed suicide not long after the book was released, Beer in the Snooker Club ends up being a somewhat tragic memorial to him."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "\"Beer in the Snooker Club\" by Waguih Ghali is a wonderful trip back to 1950's Cairo in this fabulous reissue.
