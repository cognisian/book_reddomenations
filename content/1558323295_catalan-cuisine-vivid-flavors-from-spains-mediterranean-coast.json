I first became aware of this book from reading about it in one of my mom's old Gourmet magazines, IIRC.  They described the \"recipe\" for Pa amb Tomaquet, a solid slice of country bread, toasted over a fire and rubbed with garlic, I think, and an almost overripe tomato.  Finished off with a drizzle of fruity olive oil and a sprinkling of salt, it sounded like heaven to me.  Food like this is now to be found everywhere, but back then, it was a revelation.  I was young enough that a cookbook was a big investment, but I had to have it. It introduced me to a whole new way of looking at ingredients.  I grew up with homemade raviolis, garlic bread, great salads and so on.  While these recipes used many of the same ingredients, it was fresh and different, and I loved it.Coleman Andrews does his research, spending time in the locations he writes about, meeting the cooks, learning about the culture.  When you've bought one of his books, you can't help but feel like you've been there and met those people, that you understand the basis of their cuisine.  The book is a learning tool as well as a great cookbook. That original volume is packed away now, but I missed it enough to be delighted to find the Kindle version.  If you like this book, you might also enjoy his, The Country Cooking of Ireland, also available in Kindle format, as well as print.  I tried to insert the link, but for some reason, this review app is sending me to a German book of some sort.  I tested the link in my browser, and it went to the right book, but...sigh.  You'll have to do the search yourself, but it will be worth it."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "We have been to Catalonya numerous times and what we find in this book is not what we have experienced in the culinary arts in the area.

I got a little history of food and Catalan culture."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Many people associate Catalan cuisine with Spain (and indeed, the author writes extensively about the Catalan culture in Spain within this cookbook). but I was introduced to Catalan Cuisine on a weekend trip to Andorra (that tiny country nestled between France and Spain) a few years ago. It was love at first sight and I knew I wanted a Catalan cookbook to add to my collection. Spanish tortilla, shrimp in garlic butter, creme Catalan - all the classics are here in one volume plus so much more.  I love to put together dinner parties featuring an assortment of small plates drawn from this cookbook and there hasn't been a recipe I've tried yet from Colman's book that hasn't turned out well."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Many of the recipes are purportedly tested by Mr. Andrews's recipe tester, Zimmerman.  But a significant number of recipes have badly mistaken ingredient measurements, such as for the Catalan cheesecake pastry dough which is completely wrong.  Even if correct, it is a lousy recipe.  Use Paula Wolfert's recipe for pate sucree' instead."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I have prepared many of the recipes in Andrews's revised edition of Catalan cooking.  Unfortunately, despite his occasional reference to his alleged recipe tester named Zimmerman, it is apparent that Andrews is in the great British tradition of a collector, not an actor in the kitchen.  Many of his recipes are just wrong, some of them incredibly wrong, especially in proportions and in cooking times.  For example, he has a Majorcan recipe for a flan or torte with a risen crust using (here in the USA) ricotta, eggs, cream, sugar, lemon juice and peel, et al.  However, the crust recipe is WAY off, and I know because I have baked thousands of loaves of bread over the past 45 years, and so I know a cockamamie recipe for any kind of bread dough when I see one.  Make the crust dough according to Andrews' specs and not only will you have enough dough for TWO large flans/tortes, but it will be a sort of thick griddle cake batter instead of a dough.  Similarly, the filling uses way too much liquid and too little ricotta, so that you don't get a filling with his proportions but rather a viscous mess that will never set up firmly enough.  Finally, the cooking time for a 4-egg recipe is insane -- you can't set a 4 egg recipe even with a radical pruning of the cream by a third unless you bake the flan for nearly an hour at 350F.Many other recipes in the book are similarly wrong-headed so that the inventive and experienced cook must use the conceptual template of each recipe without succumbing to the quantities and proportions, which are sometimes so wrong that the result is a disaster."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A terrific presentation of a delightful and in depth dive into a culture through it's interesting food."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a wonderful collection of some of my favorite dishes growing up in Andorra.
