For months, I'd passed it by in favor of more \"serious\" reading. But being chair-bound for several weeks with an injury, I found myself burrowing deeper into my multiple stacks of unread books and dusted off (what proved to be) this delightful volume.Its light, fast-moving story line and diverse characters have been tonic to my broken body and discouraged outlook. No heavy mental lifting required, but nonetheless well-written, thoroughly engaging, and just plain fun. (I laughed out loud more than once.) Throughout, I eagerly raced from one chapter to the next to see what surprises awaited among the many plot gyrations and unexpected layers of character interface.The book was well worth my time, a welcome lift to sagging spirits. I was sorry to reach the last page."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A glorious romp through the world of writing workshops, guided by an expert con man we can't help but like.  In \"Famous Writers I Have Known,\" James Magnuson has created a wonderfully entertaining page-turner, made all the more scintillating by the obvious parallels to real-world authors and a real-world MFA program at a well-known university.  Magnuson lets us all feel like insiders as he pokes fun at all the players in a writing community, allowing us to laugh at ourselves and our pretenses in the process."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A likeable narrator and the inner workings of 2 easily recognizable famous author archetypes.

I really didn't care about anyone, particularly the protagonist/antagonist.  He was a colorless zero and I found it difficult to find anything to like or hate about him.  Also, his attempts at humor generally fell flat and were more annoying than funny. I finished the book primarily because I wanted to see how Mr. Magnuson mechanized the end of the story.  It's tidy but unrewarding."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "What a marvelous academic read. Faculty lounges will never be the same again.

S. Mohle\u2014a famously reclusive writer\u2014and teaching in a prestigious writing program somewhere in Texas. Streetwise and semiliterate, Frankie finds that being treated as a genius agrees with him.\r\n\r\nThe program has been funded by Rex Schoeninger, the world\u2019s richest novelist, who is dying. Buzzards are circling, angling for the remains of Rex\u2019s fortune, and Frankie quickly realizes that he has been presented with the opportunity of a lifetime. Complicating matters is the fact that Rex is haunted by a twenty-five-year feud with the shadowy Mohle. What rankles Rex is that, while he has written fifty bestsellers and never gotten an ounce of literary respect, Mohle wrote one slender novel, disappeared into the woods, and become an icon. Determined to come to terms with his past, Rex has arranged to bring his rival to Texas, only to find himself facing off against an imposter.\r\n\r\nFamous Writers I Have Known is not just an unforgettable literary romp but also a surprisingly tender take on two men\u2014one a scam artist frantic to be believed, the other an old lion desperate to be ", "asin": "0393240886", "rank": "1553709", "city": "Austin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ALn6PeDcL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
