I'm only sorry that the borders of Peter Mayle's Provence are so limited. I've always viewed Provence from the Italian border to the mouth of the Rhone. He's left out a good part of the Provence that I know best. Nevertheless the part that he covers is filled with interesting places, foods and people.Enjoyable and really worth reading!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I am excited about my trip to the Provence Region in April of this year!

Almost new, and far better than most used books we've examined. We're looking forward to spending some time in Provence as part of a trip to France in a couple of weeks. Since my wife previously enjoyed reading Peter Mayle's anecdotal tales of life as an Englishman trying to adapt to Proven\u00e7al culture, weather, and food, this humorous, vivid and useful cataloging of what makes Provence special was a fantastic follow-up! My wife loves it; she says it reads like a novel, not an encyclopedia. Enjoy!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book is delightful, charming, and witty!
