It corresponds temporally to the first volume of Nin's published diaries, written between October 1931 and October 1932, yet is radically different, in that that book begins with a description of the landscape of and around her home and never mentions her husband, whereas \"Henry and June\" begins with discussion of Nin's sex life and is full of her struggles and passionate relationship with husband Hugo, and then, as the novel/memoir progresses, other lovers.\r\n\r\nThis, the first of currently five volumes of unexpurgated diaries, concentrates on her passionate involvement with the writer Henry Miller and his wife June Miller.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that Nin's source material \u2014her diaries \u2014was able to spawn two dramatically different narratives about the same time period, both widely read and praised. The expurgated diary reveals Nin the philosopher and amateur but astute psychologist. The unexpurgated diary reveals a woman breaking out into wild sexual discovery. It is introduced by her second\u2014coterminous\u2014husband.\r\n\r\nA film based on the book was released in 1990.\r\n\r\nWikipedia", "asin": "2253052736", "rank": "10150248", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Cc6EIIQ7L.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
