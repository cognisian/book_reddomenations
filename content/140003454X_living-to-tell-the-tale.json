Stories involving his family, specially his mother, are the most interesting, but you will learn about his siblings and papa also. Chapters about his student days are also interesting but his life as a reporter and editorial writer lack the intimate details much of the time. He moves back and forth between Bogata and several other Colombian towns and is sometimes confusing. The ongoing civil wars make up much of the background. My feeling is that the biography of Marquez by another author will provide a more organized account of his life. He says very little about his future wife and it is not explained when they married. The story ends somewhat abruptly when he leaves Columbia for Switzerland."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "okay"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I once had a friend, a Cuban/American professor of governance at Georgetown. We would meet occasionally for lunch in the elegant faculty lounge to discuss the affairs of the day in Latin America; what the future of his imprisoned birth island would be; how the changes of the 21st century would sweep across the continent after the \u2018pink tide\u2019 was spent.\u201cThe problem with Americans,\u201d he would often tell me, as we talked about the waves of communism and dictatorship that never cease to buffet the continent\u2019s shores, \u201cis that they don\u2019t understand Latin American culture is not \u2018western\u2019, at least not in the way you think.\u201d It\u2019s a hard concept \u2013 we have so much of Latin America running through our veins; through our history and our imagination. The Spanish Mission of San Xavier sitting like a shining pearl in the desert south of Tucson; signs in Miami declaring proudly \u201cEnglish Also Spoken Here\u201d \u2013 didn\u2019t American soldiers also fight beside Simon Bolivar? Isn\u2019t the United States the world\u2019s 5th largest Spanish speaking country?North America \u2013 at least the northern part (excluding the American South, which was partially the cause of our great war) \u2013 has never been feudal. Great families controlling land and with it the destinies of their \u2018peasants\u2019. Latin America, on the contrary and up until recently, has been a feudal place. In Venezuela they were called the \u2018Amos del Valle\u2019 \u2013 the Lords of the Valley (of Caracas) \u2013 thick and rich, and white: they are still there, despite Venezuela\u2019s own modern \u2018Violencia\u2019. In Venezuela it was the pitiless dictatorship of Juan Vicente Gomez that transformed the country from its feudal agrarianism to the makings of a modern nation. That, and the discovery of oil, kept Venezuela from descending into a confrontation between the landed aristocracy and the peasants \u2013 between the rich and the poor \u2013 between the white and the afro-indigenous \u2013 between the past, and the future. At least till Hugo Chavez.For Colombia, this reckoning came earlier; and it was bloodier because there was nothing to smooth over the carnage. It came in the form of a 1000 days war at the center of five decades of simmering conflict \u2013 lasting even through today. It pitted Colombia\u2019s ruling families \u2013 Restrepos and Santos and Pastranas and others \u2013 against a restive peasantry itching for opportunity.Gabriel Garcia Marquez was part of this peasantry. And \u201cLiving to Tell the Tale\u201d, the autobiography of the first half of his life (I think he planned a 2nd part \u2013 one that never came), is the story of a young man, journalist and writer who was straddling this tumultuous period in Colombian history. He was trying to cover it as a journalist; he was trying to understand it and write about it; and he was trying to survive it. The assassination of Jorge Eli\u00e9cer Gait\u00e1n; \u201cLa Violencia\u201d, a decade of violence following this event. Coups and counter-coups. The beginnings of Colombian communism \u2013 which spawned the FARC when the war between the Conservatives and the Liberals was not conclusively won; a communism like that of the Soviet Union, not the proletariat against the bourgeois but a peasant uprising against the nobles.Gabo lived all of it \u2013 and that\u2019s what makes this story incredible. It\u2019s the story of the coming of age of a great writer born of poverty in the course of the coming of age of his country.Gabo had communist sympathies \u2013 because he was from peasant stock and revolution seemed the only way out. Not that he was a revolutionary himself (he was not quick to pick up a gun after witnessing the murder of Gaitan); he was, first and foremost, a writer. And anything that got in the way of that calling was discarded. He probably had bad ideas \u2013 certainly communism was not the answer to Colombia\u2019s nasty oligarchy (as it hasn\u2019t been the answer in Venezuela). But I can see how a poor boy would have a soft place for those who tormented his oppressors.\u201cLiving to Tell the Tale\u201d did give me a better understanding of Gabo\u2019s writing. He is, above all, extremely provincial. He is a village boy from pre-modern Colombia; and even as he traveled \u2013 Paris and Mexico and farther \u2013 he could not shake his roots: they were everything he was. Which I suppose makes his success that much more astounding just as it makes his writing that much more genuine.I\u2019m still not a fan of \u201c100 Years\u201d \u2013 and Gabo isn\u2019t my favorite novelist \u2013 but I\u2019m immensely glad I read his auto-biography. It is the story of a writer, told by a writer, and has given me tremendous encouragement for my own writing. For that, I thank him."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "It is certainly not as riveting as One Hundred Years of Solitude but offers many hours of engaging pleasure-reading."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great book!!!!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The most engaging portions fo Marquez autobiography are those parallel to the village tales of A Hundred Years of Solitude, that is, his childhood memories, interactions with his mother, and the settings for both.
