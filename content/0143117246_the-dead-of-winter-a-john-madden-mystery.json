The story starts with Louis arriving into small Michigan town to take a new job as policemen. Authors did a great job in describing the atmosphere of the region. The constant cold, the snow, the vast uninhabited areas, the frozen lake and the isolation of people living there made me almost shiver. The plot was a little bit predictable, it was easy to guess who the villain was and why but the details were still interesting. What I did not like about this book was that almost everybody was pissed off at everybody else for not always obvious reason. So much anger and aggression and only some of it justified. It left me depressed and tired rather than entertained or even just involved."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "What a page turner.

I found the characters to be engaging, although Louis Kincaid himself is a little on the bland side in my opinion, especially as the lead character in a book series. But the plot made up for a lot. It wasn't predictable or hard to follow, and I appreciated that it wasn't too neatly tied up in the end."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Slow to start with, and although I enjoy development of main characters, this was overwhelming and overdone.

John takes a special interest in seeing the case resolved as he feels a sense of responsibility for the dead girl, but as usual a dark twisty criminal is at the heart of the novel.  Somehow the book taking 3 books to get 20 years ahead doesn't lose reader attention even though you read it for the characters missing huge swathes of life is not a problem.
