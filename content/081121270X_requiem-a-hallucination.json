I greatly admire his 1994 novel \"Periera Declares\" won the Aristeion European Literature Prize.Tabucchi wrote the novella \"Requiem,\" subtitled \"A Hallucination,\" in Portuguese. It involves a reverie-filled day by an aging writer not unlike Tabucchi that involves visiting a graveyard, a bordello, a crumbling mansion on the Caiscais coast, and culminates in a meal with the ghost of a poet who can only be Fernando Pessoa, the towering figure of 20th-century literature whom Tabucchi has translated and written about (with his Portuguese wife).The text of \"Requiem\" occupies only 90 pages (plus three pages providing detail on the many Portuguese dishes mentioned in the text). I don't regret the small amount of time I spent reading the book, though \"Periera Declares,\" which I can heartily recommend for characterization, plotting, and subject matter."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "\"Requiem\" is Antonio Tabucchi's praise for Lisbon. It describes the journey of one man through the Portugalise city, where he meets some people, dead and alive, in the otherwise deserted city.The peculiarity of the character is the fact that he has lost his superego, with the consequences of his id, the subconscious fludding his contious mind, hence makim him live in a sort of dreamworld. And from that world come the dead of his past.The book is slightly semi-artistic, and it's message is left to be speculated about. And even if the basic premise of the story is intriquing, it fails to measure up to the potential it contains.A short, nice read, wich doesn't offer anything to think about."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The lightness of Tabucchi's Requiem makes it a very easy book to like. It helps to be at least a little bit familiar with the Portugese poet and author Fernando Pessoa who is the figure Tabucchi is to meet. The novella is very short (107 pages but lots of chapters so lots of white space and big print) and really more on the amusing than philosophical side. The little conversations read like little asides but soon one realizes that is what the book is, a little aside. There are some amusing references made about modern literature that could very well apply to the book we are reading and also a very interesting reference to a story written that later came true(a kind of mini meditation on how fact and fiction mimic each other or follow the same laws, the same could be said for life and dreams) but the book purposely stays on the surface of things. Food is the real center of the book. That is the most substantial and sustaining ritual at the heart of life, at least that apsect of life that is most real it seems to Tabucchi. So the books pages pass, each meeting a chance for conversations and most of the conversations are just small talk. Kind of like life. It is clear the events are all dreamed and so Tabucchi is free to talk to both friends and relations living and dead. But they say the same kinds of things to each other in the dream world that they did in real life. And the dream world is little different than the real world. That is the charm of the book. Life is a dream, so eat."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The lightness of Tabucchi's Requiem makes it a very easy book to like.

The action takes place within a single day - the  action being a dream, an hallucination of the narrator.  The narrator is  introduced as he is annoyed that the person he is to meet has missed their  appointment at 12 noon - only to realize that 12 to a ghost is more likely  midnight.  The person he is to meet is not explicitly identified but is  most likely the poet Pessoa.The narrative then covers the time until the  midnight meeting.  In this time the narrator meets a drug addict in the  park, a seller of lottery tickets, a gypsy who reads his fortune, a dead  friend, a madame of an unsavory hotel, his deceased father, a barkeeper, a  painter of details from the Temptation of St. Anthony, a lighthouse  keeper's wife who is caretaker for a house in which he once lived, a former  lover, a seller of stories, and finally the intended guest.

He spent many years there as director of the Italian Cultural Institute in Lisbon. He even wrote Requiem in Portuguese; it had to be translated into Italian for publication in his native Italy.\r\n\r\nRequiem's narrator has an appointment to meet someone on a quay by the Tagus at twelve. But, it turns out, not twelve noon, twelve midnight, so he has a long time to while away. As the day unfolds, he has many encounters\u2015a young junky, a taxi driver who is not familiar with the streets, several waiters, a gypsy, a cemetery keeper, the mysterious Isabel, an accordionist, in all almost two dozen people both real and illusionary. Finally he meets The Guest, the ghost of the long dead great poet Fernando Pessoa. Part travelog, part autobiography, part fiction, and even a bit of a cookbook, Requiem becomes an homage to a country and its people, and a farewell to the past as the narrator lays claim to a literary forebear who, like himself, is an evasive and many-sided personality.", "asin": "081121270X", "rank": "2497444", "city": "Lisbon", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/418XPEWN18L.jpg", "country": "Portugal", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
