I usually never thought about reading about anything like this until I read Billy Idol's autobiography and thought that this book would be pretty interesting, talking about an awesome generation that I would've loved to have been a part of, but of course I wasn't born until the 90s so I'm sad I missed out. When I saw how old the book was I figured I would have a hard time trying to find a copy and when I found mine, it said it was an ex-library copy so I was worried it would be pretty beat up but it was actually in pretty good condition. I'm planning on using this to help write papers for my sociology and psychology classes for my senior year!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Highly recommended"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of my favorite books ever. If you're generation x and remember Reagan and the looming possibility on nuclear war you might like the background themes, where the main characters are dealing with finding meaning in the modern world and doing it partial by telling each other melancholy but beautiful stories. The chapters are somewhat discrete as separate sub stories. It makes reading feel light and digestible."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I had heard about this book for several years as the defining book of Generation-X, so my expectations were high going into it. I suppose Coupland coined the term and sometimes that's all that matters. For me, I found the characters uninteresting and very difficult to relate to, despite being Gen-X myself. While the angst and apathy that defined our generation exists in these characters, I struggled to find the reason why these characters became what they were. It might've been more interesting to me if the author had provided more background on why the characters were so cynical and unhappy. But maybe that's what Coupland wanted to do, explain a generation to that generation from the perspective of someone outside it. If generation-x interests you, you'll enjoy bits and pieces from the book, at a minimum. Maybe more."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A nice trip down memory lane."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Not what I was expecting, but still is well written."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Ground Zero for books on the subject.

In search of the drastic changes that will lend meaning to their lives, they've mired themselves in the detritus of American cultural memory. Refugees from history, the three develop an ascetic regime of story-telling, boozing, and working McJobs--\"low-pay, low-prestige, low-benefit, no-future jobs in the service industry.\" They create modern fables of love and death among the cosmetic surgery parlors and cocktail bars of Palm Springs, disturbingly funny tales of nuclear waste, historical overdosing, and mall culture.\r\n\r\nA dark snapshot of the trio's highly fortressed inner world quickly emerges--landscapes peopled with dead TV shows, \"Elvis moments,\" and semi-disposable Swedish furniture. And from these landscapes, deeper portraits emerge, those of fanatically independent individuals, pathologically ambivalent about the future and brimming with unsatisfied longings for permanence, for love, and for their own home. Andy, Dag, and Claire are underemployed, overeducated, intensely private, and unpredictable. Like the group they mirror, they have nowhere to assuage their fears, and no culture to replace their anomie.", "asin": "031205436X", "rank": "114992", "city": "Los Angeles", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51FZ-Jz8yQL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
