The fact that I'm on book 7 should tell the thinking people out there that clearly, L.J. Sellers knows how to write a good mystery. Lots of details, love, and loss. I can kind of tell the writer might be a republican...there are a couple comments she wrote in that are probably a definition of Detective Jackson's narrow-minded side, but I like him so far."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Author L.J. Sellers would have been hard pressed to come up with a more provocative title than \u201cThe Sex Club\u201d for the first book in her mystery series involving Detective Wade Jackson of the Eugene, OR, police department. however, despite the title and some equally provocative subject matter, the book is a solid, compelling procedural very reminiscent of the TV series \u201cLaw and Order,\u201d on which sensational crimes were solved every week by the tried-and-true methods of solid police work.The titular club is a former Bible study group for middle-school students from strong religious backgrounds that somehow morphed into a convenient method of arranging illicit get togethers. When a 13-year-old girl\u2019s nude body is found in a dumpster, Jackson winds up investigating the murder, and uncovers a number of suspects, including the mayor of Eugene, who kept a secret apartment close to the location where the body was discovered. In the meantime, other members of Jackson\u2019s department investigate a related crime, a bombing at an abortion clinic that resulted in a patient\u2019s death. The bomber is an anti-abortion zealot whose daughter happens to be a member of the club.Sellers does an excellent job of keeping several storylines going at once and alternating chapters between the points of view of several different characters. The book is never difficult to follow and by revealing the identity of one killer early while keeping the other one a mystery, the author combines the elements of the traditional whodunit with a well-written suspense tale, as the bomber plots some additional violence against some of the book\u2019s other main characters. Jackson and his fellow detectives investigate the cases the old fashioned way, by interviewing possible suspects and gathering evidence, and, in Sellers\u2019 hands, their work never gets boring for the reader.I especially enjoyed the setting of \u201cThe Sex Club.\u201d Most mysteries seem to be set either in big cities with dozens of cops and lots of technical and forensic support or, on the other hand, small towns or rural settings where the main character is practically a one-man (or woman) show. Eugene (population about 150,000) is large enough to have a detective squad (and a sizable suspect pool), but small enough that Jackson can interact with the rest of the detectives. I especially enjoyed the description of the difficulties Jackson encountered in getting DNA testing, something that seems to get done in minutes on TV but, in this book, required him to drive to Portland and deliver the samples and other evidence personally.Because \u201cThe Sex Club\u201d is the first book in the Jackson series, readers don\u2019t know as much about him as they learn later, but he and a couple of the other characters who become series regulars are fairly well developed, with credible personal lives and problems. Jackson\u2019s daughter is a classmate of the dead girl and some of the other members of the club and had herself been a part of the original Bible study class. After Jackson finds out, the relationship between father and daughter becomes very believably strained at times.Author Sellers does fall back on a couple of clich\u00e9d plot devices in \u201cThe Sex Club,\u201d however. Most notably, since the investigation seems to implicate the mayor, Jackson has to wade his way through political roadblocks and his rather cartoonish superior who keeps insisting Jackson is wrong and threatens to fire him. This plot device has been beaten to death in far too many similar stories and gets rather tiresome here. In addition, Sellers makes her political views fairly obvious in this book, and \u201cThe Sex Club\u201d comes close at times to annoying proselytizing, but she never lets the story get too bogged down in political chest thumping.\u201cThe Sex Club\u201d isn\u2019t quite at the same level as some of the later Jackson books I\u2019ve read, which I think is more to the credit of Sellers\u2019 development as a writer than an indictment of the current book. In any event, the novel is topical (even though written about five years ago) and a page turning mystery. Some readers may well find the subject matter distasteful, although the material is not graphic. For other mystery fans, however, \u201cThe Sex Club\u201d is a good introduction to an enjoyable series."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This was my first book by the Author!
