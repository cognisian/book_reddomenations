Really enjoyed a fast paced story."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I would recomend this book if you are looking for a quick read that is hard to put down. It was an interesting story but there were some editing mistakes that made the story seem weak. For example some plot revelations were revealed twice as if it was the first time learning about them and the ending was a bit of a let-down."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "very good great price"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very engrossing story about female to male harassment in the corporate world.

Crichton is a Dickens, of sorts though, in that there is always a Secret Message of Significance hidden by the day-to-day Gossip of his Stories.  So I skimmed past the Offensive and sought out that Secret Subplot - and FOUND IT!  Did you????
