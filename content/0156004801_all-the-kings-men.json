Warren's stark (sorry) portrayal of America's obsession with scandal that swims in the clouds of politics is wholly, unsympathetically, and brutally honest in this huge novel. And it is a huge novel, with interpersonal, interpolitical, financial, and scandalous connections between many characters, all of whom seem to support and promote the candidates that seem to have their own best interests at heart. When Stark comes along, there is no question that he is the people's, and corporation's best demagogue to put into office. He came from nothing and certainly lived the American political dream with all of its terrible consequences and choices along the way.The question for me became, do I care?That answer didn't come for me until about four-hundred pages in, for chapters seven and eight specifically, and straight through to the end of the novel. I enjoyed the opening, but the true heart of the plot begins to pay off as our narrator begins to uncover much of what the entirety of the novel's setup is built for. The writing in the book is excellent, and some paragraphs of description took my breath away (although I will say that there was a strange disconnectedness of some of the longer metaphors).  The narrator's story - one of a writer whose love and devotion, examination, persistence, obsession, investigative curiosity, and that of a man trying to find his place in the world - was much more beautiful to me than Willie Stark's. Unsurprisingly, in the final pages of the book, we meet him as someone resigned to the fact that it is just as much his story (even though he didn't know it at the time).Did I enjoy it? You know, I am not sure. I would say that the book has tremendous merits as an accurate document of American political operations. The book has some amazingly beautiful, funny, violent, and surprising passages, and Warren's prose handles them with an adept swiftness. But I felt like the book was a bit too long, and with a very Gatsby-esque central figure, I wonder if the book needed to be as big as Stark's ego. It was a great book, but one I will likely not pick up again \u2013 the Goodreads quotations section might suit my needs for revisiting what beautiful language I will miss when I put it down. The characters are three-dimensional, though, and it is a mirror to the political mess we find America in at times... But the story of the writer was what kept me reading. I do look forward to passing along my BookCrossing \u2013 marked copy to friends and hearing what they have to say!I read this book as a selection from two lists I am slowly getting through, the Esquire 75 and The Modern Library 100."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "great"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Rich characters with beautifully scripted language.

I learned more about the realities of government and politics from reading this fictional story set in the 1930\u2019s than from any government calls in high school or college. If you want to understand how our government really works \u2013 this is a must read. As the saying goes \u2013 sausage and laws \u2013 two things that we all enjoy but do not want to see made. True words! The egoism, greed, lust, vanity, deception and back-room deals displayed in All the Kings Men help you understand that government is a very corrupt, complicated and messy business.The main character, Willie Stark, is a charismatic man of the people, who appeals to the little man with promises of taking his business to the halls of power and seeing that the working people get a fare shake in government. As you may guess, all his best intentions are soon abandoned as his taste for power and position take hold. To retain his status he must play the game laid out by the powers-that-be \u2013 the moneyed establishment who control the true levers of power. At which point, his words do not change, but his conviction and effort on behalf of the people who believe in him diminish greatly.Lest on believe that this is a story of days gone by one need only reflect for a moment on our current government (local, state and federal). Most people hate the government, hate congress \u2013 but like their own representative. Year after year we elect candidates who promise reform, change, to end corruption, to shrink government, or solve all our problems or whatever it takes to get elected. I believe that many of these individuals believe that they can actually do some of these things if given the opportunity.Then they into the black hole of capital politics and their visions of serving the people and cleaning up the government get flushed down the toilet. No representative can solve our governmental crisis for us \u2013 it requires deliberate involvement by every citizen to do so \u2013 but we are way too busy trying to get through our own days to do such work \u2013 so we abandon it to our elected officials (can you say vicious circle?). And here we are!All the Kings Men is an education in individual responsibility. Looking behind the curtain to see the motivation and machination of government is a great reminder that each of us must take responsibility for maintaining the integrity of our political system. We must hold our elected officials accountable, know our history, understand the foundations of our system, recognize its importance and not allow the cult of personality to degrade it value or legitimacy. Don\u2019t fall in love with the smile \u2013 listen to their words and \u00a0hold them accountable for what they say and do \u2013 failure to do so is to surrender your autonomy and independence.It is not uncommon to believe that our elected officials are off at the capital fighting on our behalf against all odds. We cannot accept they may be a part of the problem \u2013 active participants in it \u2013 and be profiting from it all the while. Without a lot of digging one can discover the number of congressman who leave office much richer than when they entered (Nancy Pelosi) and transition quickly into very high-paying private sector businesses who benefit greatly from their governmental connections and influence. The struggle for the independent in government is great and I have tremendous respect for anyone who gives it a go (Ron Paul & Rand Paul). Their plight makes me think of Jimmy Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, a great Frank Capra film about an innocent, honest man who becomes a senator \u2013 is dismayed by the corruption and stands up for truth and integrity \u2013 and becomes a target of all who profit from business as usual. Great movie \u2013 give it a tumble."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The descriptions of people, time, and place are phenomenal.  Many readers don't care for this book because it is written in a style evocative of the time and place of the 1930's south, which is slow and wordy.  However that is part of the genius of the writer.  There are so many levels to this novel and they creep up on you as the book progresses.  It's a great piece of literature and I thoroughly enjoyed it."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The story line was interesting and compelling.

It describes the career of Willie Stark, a back-country lawyer whose idealism is overcome by his lust for power. New Foreword by Joseph Blotner for this fiftieth anniversary edition.\r\n\r\nThe central character of Willie Stark (often simply referred to as \"the Boss\") undergoes a radical transformation from an idealistic lawyer and weak gubernatorial candidate into a charismatic and extraordinarily powerful governor. In achieving this office Stark comes to embrace various forms of corruption and builds an enormous political machine based on patronage and intimidation. His approach to politics earns him many enemies in the state legislature, but does not detract from his popular appeal among many of his constituents, who respond with enthusiasm to his fiery populist manner.\r\n\r\nStark's character is often thought to be inspired by the life of Huey P. Long, former governor of Louisiana and that state's U.S. senator in the mid-1930s. Huey Long was at the zenith of his career when he was assassinated in 1935; just a year earlier, Robert Penn Warren had begun teaching at Louisiana State University.[10] Stark, like Long, is shot to death in the state capitol building by a physician. The title of the book possibly came from Long's motto, \"Every Man a King.\"", "asin": "0156004801", "rank": "160744", "city": "New Orleans", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51UIm5irUhL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
