His name is Stefan Zweig (1881-double suicide with his second wife in South America in 1942). Zweig was the second son of a millionaire Jewish businessman and lived in luxury in old Vienna. He attended school in the city and matriculated at the University of Vienna where he earned a doctorate in philosophy)In this memoir the famous playwright, novelist, journalist and social commentary returns us the halcyon days of the Hapsburg Empire (quiet at least on the surface!) Zweig served for a time in the Austrian military during World War II but spent most of his time as a librarian and war correspondent. He hated war and was a pacifist. He traveled widely in Europe to many nations including Great Britain, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany and his native Austria. He also visited the USA and India.  This vivid memoir gives first hand account of his friendship with such luminaries as Sigmund Freud; Richard Strauss the composer with whom he collaborated; Hugo Irish author James Joyce,. French author Romain Roland and many others in the literary and cultural forefront of European culture. He had to flee Vienna one step of the Nazis; in 1942 he and his wife committed suicide unable to live in the vanished world of old Europe.This is a well observed memoir which deserves to be read and cherished. Zweig was a great writer and a good man."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Wonderful"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I was swindled by the title of this book. I believed, as the title suggests, that the book would paint a nostalgic verbal picture of a colorful turn of the century Vienna and the final days of the Habsburg empire. I was thinking of waltzes, white-tie balls in baroque palaces, mustachioed literati sipping coffee in grand caf\u00e9s, mutton chopped old Emperor Franz Josef and his mistress visiting the Prater in their carriage, that sort of thing. Sad to say, this book contains nothing of the sort. What I got instead was an extraordinarily tiresome, rambling, and repetitive autobiographical memoir. Stefan Zweig became an Austrian literary figure at a relatively young age. He was a successful and prolific novelist, poet and playwright. He wrote the libretto for one Richard Strauss opera and contributed to another. This memoir, written toward the end of his life, recalls in boastful and overly abundant detail his friendships with authors and artists prominent at the time (i.e. in the first three decades of the twentieth century) most of them now all but forgotten. Though known and active in the world of literature, Zweig remained a political innocent, a pacifist and so-called \u201cone-worlder\u201d, incapable of fully grasping the harsh realities of Nazism. In 1942, shortly after the publication of this memoir, he and his wife jointly committed suicide. Some 50 million civilians are believed to have been victims of World War II. Although Zweig and his wife died in Brazil, it would be fair to include them in the number."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Amazing memoir!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It amazes the clarity of thought to describe the two major conflicts in Europe which ended in horrendous wars. Notable too that in the late thirties and being apolitical he describes the events that put Hitler in position and the mechanisms he used to dominate. Through the reading one cannot stop to compare the Nazi movement with the political turmoil our country, Amerikka, is suffering under Trump. Eerie!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The book portrays an interesting take on the time. However, I found it to be dry."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is the pre-suicide autobiography of accomplished Viennese writer Stefan Zweig, who lived through the final dissolution of the old Austrian Hapsburg dynasty and ended his life in 1943 before the end of WWII. The original was written in German, which must have been exceedingly difficult to translate adequately, given its complex thought-streams and complicated sentence structure. So first off, an admiring nod to the translator, Anthea Bell, who did a masterful job of conveying the heart and soul of this book to readers of the English language and supplying excellent background in her translator's note which opens the book.Zweig was a man of many faces -- brilliant, yes! and also exceptionally self-aware. The book opens with a fascinating account of his Jewish boyhood in Vienna, his early training in the rigorous and pedantic German schools, and builds to a climax as he reflects on his experiences as a disenfranchised member of the Jewish artistic community during and after the Nazi take-over in Germany and Austria.He was conscious of the deep changes that were undermining the old regime in his native Austria and in Europe, particularly the rise of fascist sympathizers in many places in Europe during his lifetime. The tension was palpable in his haunting descriptions of life on the edge of communal insanity as the Hitler machinery marched through Europe in the late 1930\u2019s and struck down one basic human freedom after another. It was  an insidious and covert operation that became obvious to most only after-the-fact. All his books were ultimately banned by the Nazis and he fled the country and lived in exile for several years. He seems to have largely discounted his ultimate success as a major contributor to the historical record of his day while he was living through the process, chagrined that he could do nothing about it except to experience it deeply and shoulder his burden as a super-sensitive soul.In many ways, as I read through this rich and elegant exploration of his life and times in Vienna, Paris, Italy and America, I quietly sympathized with him at the loss of his beloved country to war and hate. I can almost hear his stark voice commenting here that he was much more rooted in literature and philosophy than he was in routine daily life, and that he expected his artistic and scholarly efforts, small as he may have viewed them, to affect or change the course of world history for the better. He had maximum refinement but lacked the common touch at a time when common people were rising and trying to upend the old regime in Austria and in so doing, opening themselves to the Nazi take-over. In light of his imminent suicide shortly after completing this book, it is fair to assume that he felt adrift on this  planet as a writer who could no longer grasp what went so terribly wrong all at once -- or how to amend it with all his worldly knowledge and massive literary skills.The realization that his past conditioning was no longer sufficient to sustain him must have been personally wrenching. In his mind, a new day was coming unbidden, and with it a profound shift in mores. In my own life, with the ascent of  Trumpism and its blatant disregard for human rights, it felt like deja vu to absorb this book, which is not only a shout-out to our collective past as scholars and thinkers, writers, musicians and artists of the sort who were at home in  pre- WWI Vienna, but also a potent reminder that a shift in culture can be ruthless and insane before the \u201cnew normal\u201d becomes apparent. It is both a swan song and a warning \u2013 and that is primarily why our book club chose to experience this book together. As a sympathetic portrait of a man and a world in acute distress, it is helpful to read it while trying to live through the crude and unconscious political agendas of our own times. It sparked intense debates and fruitful discussion among our group. Take some time to read through it slowly and let it sink in -- it is a complex book of many layers and uncannily prescient."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I thought the book, despite Zweig's self-pity (understandable in this case) was magnificent, magnificent in its details and in its ability to successfully convey the atmosphere before World War I and between the wars. The book includes marvelous portraits of famous and not-so-famous people, such as Rodin, Rilke, and Freud. His elitism is a bit cloying, but again, understandable -- and the descriptions and the wise observations make up for its flaws."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A well-told, tragic story."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "An articulate, urbane, and insightful overview of Europe before and after World War I, and the  disintegration of the Belle Epoque society.
