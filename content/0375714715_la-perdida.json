The characters are hardly developed and the entire novel is a big downer.. the main character makes poor decisions one after another as she continues to make it clear to everyone around her, unknowingly to the reader, hates her home country of America. Due to this disdain she leaves to live in Mexico with literally no plan other than to freeload on a dude she hardly knows and his friends until opportunities are handed to her.

Carla, an American estranged from her Mexican father, heads to Mexico City to \u201cfind herself.\u201d She crashes with a former fling, Harry, who has been drinking his way through the capital in the great tradition of his heroes, William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac. Harry is good\u2014humored about Carla\u2019s reappearance on his doorstep\u2014until he realizes that Carla, who spends her days soaking in the city, exploring Frida Kahlo\u2019s house, and learning Spanish, has no intention of leaving.\r\n\r\nWhen Harry and Carla\u2019s relationship of mutual tolerance reaches its inevitable end, she rejects his world of Anglo expats for her own set of friends: pretty-boy Oscar, who sells pot and dreams of being a DJ, and charismatic Memo, a left-wing, pseudo\u2013intellectual ladies\u2019 man. Determined to experience the real Mexico, Carla turns a blind eye to her new friends\u2019 inconsistencies. But then she catches the eye of a drug don, el Gordo, and from that moment on her life gets a lot more complicated, and she is forced to confront the irreparable consequences of her willful innocence.\r\n\r\nJessica Abel\u2019s evocative black\u2013and\u2013white drawings and creative mix of English and Spanish bring Mexico City\u2019s past and present to life, unfurling Carla\u2019s dark history against the legacies of Burroughs and Kahlo. A story about the youthful desire to live an authentic life and the consequences of trusting easy answers, La Perdida\u2013at once grounded in the particulars of life in Mexico and resonantly universal\u2013is a story about finding oneself by getting lost.", "asin": "0375714715", "rank": "296349", "city": "Mexico City", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QeWKqntUL.jpg", "country": "Mexico", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
