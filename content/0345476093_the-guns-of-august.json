While somewhat dense at times the revelatory nature of the narrative makes the difficult sections well worth the effort as Tuchman build a chronology of false assumptions, petty grievances, and missed opportunities that lead to 4 years of unimaginable suffering and the devastation of the old order in Europe."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Somehow I made it through four years of HS \"honors\" English and history, then...ahem...quite a few years more of college, with a minor in history.  Yet I'd never heard of Barbara Tuchman, nor heard the remarkable (and terrible) story of this book's genesis, and eventual Pulitzer Prize.Hopefully you're not as ignorant as I was, and you simply haven't read The Guns of August because you're \"more of a WWII guy\".  I understand, I mean, the SS had skulls on their hats for gods sakes.  WWII makes for such a satisfying, archetypical story, and WWI does not have that.  In fact, quite the opposite:  its much more confused and morally ambiguous, but that's exactly what makes it more fascinating than 10 Hitlers and half-dozen Stalins; and Tuchman puts the reader into the minds of the leaders in the war's opening days with incredibly deftness, insight, and humanity.Besides, w/o understanding the thoughts and actions of the men who caused and ensured the first world war, you simply cannot grasp what was going on with the next generation in the second one.  I mean, you probably think Chamberlain was a weak-willed peacenik appeaser, willing to do anything to avoid having to fight the Germans again, don't you..."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I was expecting more of a broad stroke analysis.

Thank you."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Barbara Tuchman's breakout best seller depicts the events leading up to and the first month of World War I. There are a lot of ways to view this period of time-the birth of disillusion and the end of innocence, perhaps the major tragedy of the 20th century, the necessary pain and suffering needed to convince Europe that some form of political/economic union was preferable to generations lost in warfare, or perhaps just the birth of the modern world.  However you care to see it knowledge of this era leads to a more mature understanding of the roots of the world we live in. When I finish one of Tuchman's works I have a much improved sense of the events,personalities and locations that weave the background that leads to an overall understanding of just what happened. More importantly and difficult to put into words I get a feeling, the flavor of the age(Zeitgeist). Do not think of this book as homework, it bears little resemblance to those dry,excruitiatingly boring history texts I had to read in school.  Tuchman brings a passion to her work.  She augments that with hard work. Research on this book took a major chunk of her life and from a reader's viewpoint it was time well spent. She caps it off with polished prose that sets a standard for popular history. Dare I use the over worked cliche\"more exciting than a fiction thriller.\"Note: Tuchman's next work published four years later in 1966,the excellent The Proud Tower acts as a prequel to The Guns of August depicting the two decades leading up to WW I done with an end of era flavor."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Difficult read since it is over mired in detail. Worth the read though."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Scholars still argue about the significance of the weeks in between the Archduke assassination and the outbreak of general hostilities we now call World War One, but the fact remains this is one of Barbara Tuchman's outstanding works:  accessible to the public, and indispensable in understanding the role of strategy and firepower in the war's early days.  Great to read: I recommend it highly."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The meager lecture I heard on this topic back in high school turned out to be wholly inadequate. The killing of the Archduke wasn't the cause of the First War. That was only the excuse to do something the Great Powers had been gleefully planning for decades. And then, when the war didn't end in a few weeks, as anyone who knew anything was sure it it must, this book introduces you to the men who then proceeded to kill millions out of sheer obtuseness. This book is highly engaging, and neither flippant nor shallow."}]}, "authors": ["Barbara W.
