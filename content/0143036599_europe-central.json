Growing up in the Sixties, born a decade after the war's end, it seemed ages ago and impossible to imagine as real.  Now it seems only yesterday.  The tragicomic election of Trump, marking the unmistakable decline of the U.S., and the rise of China, make a new world war all too imaginable.Vollmann's 750-page novel moves back and forth between the two central antagonists in the war, Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia, presenting fictionalized accounts of real historical individuals and events.  I initially found the style difficult, and it took me months to finally finish, setting it down periodically before returning.  There were two things that compelled me to pick it up and to persevere -- first, my annual trips to Berlin for the past several years, which have led to a fascination with German history, and second, my love for the Russian composer Dmitri Shostakovich, who is the central fictionalized character in the novel.Most of the characters are closely based on real life, and Vollmann did impressively extensive research -- the sources are presented at the back of the book.  But he created an imaginary lover for Shostakovich, and a love triangle also featuring a Soviet filmmaker is the most developed set of characters in the novel.  Other than the composer, I found the accounts of two generals, General Vlasov, who was captured by the Germans, and General Paulus, who was captured by the Russians after his defeat at Stalingrad, to be the most gripping and impressive, with Vollmann demonstrating his ability to inhabit the thinking of his characters.Europe Central won the National Book Award.  I recommend it to anyone interested in modern literary insight into the most brutal, consequential event of the 20th Century."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It joins V.

Europe Central is very different.- colder?"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "G-R-E-A-T"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Vollmann\u2019s language is rich and strawberry cream creamy, language that, without too much ado, could be transcribed into T.S. Elliot-style poetry, since his themes hit on damaged humanity, the power of history and fragmentation, and that\u2019s fragmentation as in Dada, as in Hannah H\u00f6ch and John Heartfield photomontage, a form of art Adolf Hitler especially despised. And with this quote from Mein Kampf \u201cI go the way that Providence dictates, with the assurance of a sleepwalker.\" the novel repeatedly refers to Hitler as the sleepwalker.I particularly enjoy the author\u2019s vivid image of those old black rotary telephones having ten eyes, \u201cthat octopus whose ten round eyes, each inscribed with a number, glare through you at the world.\u201d and then linking the telephone with sleepwalker Hitler: \u201cThe sleepwalker in the Reich Chancellery could tell you (not that he would) they\u2019re his eyes, lidless, oval, which imparts to them a monotonously idiotic or hysterical appearance . . . \u201c. It\u2019s that fluid yet deadly interplay of objects with the human, as if Hitler is so omnipresent he is looking at all Nazis under his command as well as the entire population of Europe through the ten eyes of each and every black telephone, 1930s-1940s ubiquitous device par excellence. \u201cThe sleepwalker\u2019s all eyes\u201d And in terms of using his eyes, let's not forget Hitler spent many years dedicated to the visual arts, drawing and painting as a near-starving artist in Vienna.Reading the first section \u2018Steel in Motion\u2019 I catch initial glimpses of the novel\u2019s stunning historical references, for example: \u201cBarrage balloons swim in the air, finned and fat like children\u2019s renderings\u201d Bulls-eye, WTV! Perfect simile; that\u2019s exactly what those barrage balloons looked like, balloon used by the British to defend against air attacks \u2013 the cables holding up the balloon would damage enemy aircraft.\u201cSteel imbued with the sleepwalker\u2019s magic sight, illuminates itself as it comes murdering.\" Again, 'Europe Central' shares much with the photomontage of artists like Hannah H\u00f6ch and John Heartfield, a steely emphasis on the intertwining of humans with technologies, for example, another image of the octopus-telephone: \u201cFrom the anus-mouth behind the dial.\u201d Vollmann soaks the black gadget for all its worth, telephone as the eyes and anus of Hitler.  Yet again, another striking quote: \u201cDon\u2019t trust any technicians who assure you that this brain is \u201cneutral\u201d \u2013 soon you\u2019ll hear how angrily the receiver jitters in its cradle.\u201d The author picks up on Marshall McLuhan -- the media is the message. It\u2019s as if in Europe Central the gadgets and all that steel exude a life of their own and are manipulating humans as their flesh-and-blood pawns. \u201cBehind the wall, rubberized black tentacles spread across Europe.\u201d Ominous, ominous \u2013 20th century technology as the strangling octopus, throttling, choking and crushing humans as if they are a school of helpless little fish in an ocean of steely, unforgiving tentacles.Then, in the section entitled \u201cThe Saviors: A Kabbalistic Tale\u201d  The author uses Aristotelian compare and contrast in presenting Fanya Kaplan with N.K.Krupskaya,, two women who saw themselves as good Marxist comrades marching shoulder to shoulder with other likeminded comrades toward the land of final synthesis as in Hegel-turned-on-his-head thesis-antithesis-synthesis. And age 28 special for both Ks, Kaplan and Krupskaya, since Krupskaya at age 28 married Lenin and Kaplan at age 28 shot him. And each woman, as per vintage photos, were stunning as a 20-year-old, but, oh my goodness, did women age quickly back then, especially when sent to prison or Siberia for years of hard labor.Anyway, Vollmann packs in historical facts and lyrical images as if he were stuffing 25 pounds of potatoes into a 10 pound sack, for example, we read the following of the last 4 days in Fanya Kaplan\u2019s life after she shot Lenin: \u201ca huddle of twenty-four grey subterranean hours like orphaned mice; and in the flesh of every hour a swarm of useless moments like ants whose queen has perished; and within each moment an uncountable multitude of instants resembling starpointed syllables shaken out of words . . . \u201c  If you were counting, that\u2019s three similes tightly packed in.  I read a Paris Review interview where Vollmann relates how at one time in his life he was writing 16 hours a day.  Now that\u2019s a writer on fire! . . . and perhaps on cocaine, speed, or, at least, caffeine.For the narrator of Europe Central, people stand tall like a certain letter of the alphabet, ideas glow like a letter, words hum like a letter, which reminds me of that Georges Perec quote: \u201cIs the aleph that place in Borges from which the entire world is visible simultaneously, anything other than an alphabet?\u201d And these Europe Central times are times for men and women of action, as in the action-packed words of Comrade N. V. Krylenko \u201cWe must execute not only the guilty. Execution of the innocent will impress the masses even more.\u201d Ironically, Comrade Krylenko would himself be shot \u2013 I wonder if the masses were impressed.However, nobody could ever doubt Comrade Krylenko was a revolutionary who took his revolution seriously.  And equally ironic, through all the revolutionary slaughter, one of N. K. Krepskaya\u2019s very favorite books was Louisa May Alcott\u2019s \u2018Little Women.\u2019 And there\u2019s a scene of N. K. Krepskaya meeting Fanya Kaplan in a prison cell that provides a stroke of Latin American-style magical realism: \"Then the letters disappeared into the woman's mouth. Krupskaya was speechless. The woman began to glow more and more, until the light from her was as white and pure as a page of the Torah.\"One of my favorite parts of the novel was all the references to Dimitri Shostakovich and his music. For example: \u201cBest listened to in a windowless room, better than best an airless room \u2013 correctly speaking a bunker sealed forever and enwrapped in tree-roots \u2013 the Eighth String Quartet of Shostakovich (Opus 110) is the living corpse of music, perfect in its horror.  Call it the simultaneous asphyxiation and bleeding of melody.\u201d  To gain a keener insight and feeling for this novel, I listened to this and other Shostakovich string quartets repeatedly during my reading.  All in all, I great novel, but I must say not a novel exactly to my taste since I found, for one thing, the shifting first-person narrator at a distance from the other characters.  I contrast this with another 800 page novel set in Europe and Russia during WWII: \u201cThe Kindly Ones\u201d by Jonathan Littell, a novel where the first-person narrator was a member of the Nazi SS.  The evil of Littell's novel was so real, so immediate, so powerful, I had to listen to the audiobook while taking my walks and let the evil run down my legs and out the bottom of my feet.  Europe Central is an encyclopedic literary monument to an incredible time in 20th century European history but, for me, Vollmann\u2019s novel lacks the power of Littell\u2019s."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It is very rare that I come across a book that grabs me emotionally as strongly as Europe Central did.  An overwhelming evocation of the death and destruction that was Europe and Germany in the 20th century, particularly during World War II, Vollman also the moral dilemmas and ambiguity that people are forced to face especially when living in a state of war and totalitarism.As many have said here, the story is told through pairs of \"stories\" about people, mostly historical, beginning just before and after World War I and continuing essentially up until the mid 70's.  Most of these \"pincer movements\" are in some way \"opposites,\"  often Germany v. the Soviet Union.  Thus two of the longest stories are about Russian General Andrey Vlasov and German General Friedrich Paulus.  Both were captured after their armies were surrounded and both essentially were turned to the other side.  On the other hand, early in the book, we get stories about Lenin's wife on one hand and the woman who attempted to assassinate Lenin.  These stories are connected in various ways and are essentially chronological but do not add up to a \"plot\" as such.  Rather this is a look at what life and culture were like in Europe Central.  The backbone of the book is a fictionalized life of Dmitri Shostakovich in terms of his reception by Stalin and his Communist cronies and his presence in Leningrad during much of the siege by the Nazis.I've read criticism that as \"historical fiction,\"  Europe Central is hard to read for someone not well versed in the history of WW II and the Soviet Union under Stalin.  Because these subjects are of general interest to me, I did not have this problem but I also don't feel that it has to be a problem in this age of the internet.  Wikipedia contains more than sufficient background for Vollmann's subjects.  A quick read of the entries about Kathe Kollwitz or the Battle of Stalingrad, or Kurt Gerstein or any of the other subjects will tell a reader of Europe Central all they need to know to understand Vollmann's book.  I knew nothing about Vlasov's Army but when I got to that part of Europe Central, it was a 10 minute side trip to learn how conventional historians viewed the general.  Even Shostakovich's music is readily available online, particularly Op. 40 and 110 which are so central to Europe CentralThe book is long and has been criticized as such.  I disgree with the criticism.  I found nothing that I though should have been edited out.  My only problem with it is that the death, destruction and moral ambiguity I mentioned above are relentless and made Europe Central hard for me to read emotionally.  It was rare when I could tolerate much more than 25 pages or so in a sitting and it therefore took me a while to get through its 750 pages of text (not including another 70 or so pages of source notes).  Still I did not find the book particularly hard to read, unlike some new literature.  Vollmann's structure and style are very original but not anywhere near as dense and incomprehensible as I feared.  On the contrary, his syntax and grammar should be easily accessible to any moderately educated reader.I'm not sure how I managed to miss this when it was first published and awarded the National Book Award, nor am I sure how I got this far into my life without having even heard of William Vollmann but I'm awful glad I did.  I am looking forward to Seven Dreams.  In the meantime, I recommend Europe Central highly as one of the best works I've read in a very long time."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Not my kind of book.
