A Reader's Digest version would be much better.However, you do feel for and with Maisie. She is a little girl that no one wants except one wizened old woman. No one wants her because, to a greater or lesser extent, she interferes with the various and divers sexual dalliances.Sad, but sadly, her plight is unremarkable."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Henry James' story of a little girl who is shunted around, used by her parents as a bludgeoning tool, denied what's right for her years (academic and art education), and schooled instead in her adult friends' sexual soap operas, vile attitudes and standards of conduct, moved me greatly. It's been a long time since I felt so emotionally connected to my own extreme youth. The book caused me to reflect that perhaps this is at bottom how most children are reared - perhaps why the world is full of so many terrible people.Maisie's knowing plays out in several ways. I won't spoil it for you.I read a couple of James's novels in grad school; they did nothing for me. I think I wasn't mature enough for them. What Maisie Knew has made me a James fan, eager to re-read those two and more. By pure luck I've fallen into a Wings of the Dove reading group. It comes to me exactly at the right time. (less)"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "James's middle-period style is less complex than the prose of his 'major phase,' but still may be off-putting to those who want a crisply told tale.  But it is his style that makes for the richness of this narrative.  Imagine: he uses language appropriate to a mature, well educated, cultivated  adult, but limits his perceptions to those of which a girl of ten would be capable.  We see what she sees, and infer what she misses, as she is shunted back and forth as the result of an increasingly messy divorce.  Tender and heartbreaking, it is also artistically exhilarating."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "One of Henry James\u2019s major themes in his novels is the foolishness of European and American aristocratic society of his time, circa 1900. His novel What Maisie Knew points up this theme almost without trying. Maisie is a precocious young child. When we meet her, very young, she is at the center of a court battle for custody. Each of her parents wants custody\u2014not because they love their daughter, but, as in so many battles of this nature, they want supremacy. As a result, each is given six consecutive months a year with the child. Maisie grows, and as she does, she is introduced to her mother\u2019s new husband and her father\u2019s new wife. They, too, struggle for Maisie\u2019s attention, but this time because they seem to care for her. Enter the mix is Maisie\u2019s governess Mrs. Wix, who, too, cares for the girl. But the struggle for supremacy continues, and all of the adults are foolish indeed. The edition I read was created for the release of the 2013 film of the novel, a film whose setting has been updated to \u201ctoday.\u201d And that\u2019s the beauty of this story: whether ancient times, the early 1900s, or the early twenty-first century, adults are going to be foolish and custody battles can get ugly. My only complaint is that I often got bogged down in the pronouns. When James said \u201cshe,\u201d I often got confused as to which \u201cshe.\u201d Was he referring to Maisie, the governess, the blood-mother, the step-mother? I found myself re-reading whole passages. Some will say that James strikes them as that way in all his novels: confusing and antiquated in his prose. But I\u2019ve read nine or ten of his novels, and this is the only one I\u2019ve gotten lost in. I love his writing. Yes, it is a style of another era, but his characters are rich and flawed and totally believable and his plots are engrossing and relatable."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Although Henry James was a talented writer of classic literature, the plot advanced excruciating slowly."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "In \u201cWhat Maisie Knew,\u201d Henry James explores the dynamics of a very modern family from the point of view of young Maisie Farange, whose parents divorce amid accusations of infidelity and neglect. To survive in this environment, Maisie must negotiate new alliances and, at the same time, avoid taking sides as her parents, their respective lovers and even the nanny battle for supremacy.The novel \u2013 with its convoluted plot, profound psychological depth, and sentences that seem to run on for paragraphs -- sees James at his most \u201cJamesian,\u201d for lack of a better word. This can be both good and bad. Readers who see this through, though, will be rewarded with an insightful and, ultimately, heartbreaking portrayal of how divorce affects one child in particular.
