Each chapter a distinctive stretch of one melodious babbling brook. It sketches a little dystopian world in the reader\u2019s imagination. The main character a wise fool. Not sharing in the commonsense of his fellow citizens, his foolish wisdom seems more human and humane by comparison, as he readily excuses others\u2019 their inhumanity on the basis that there is no place for being humane in the framework of their commonsense: \u201cit\u2019s not that men don\u2019t wish to be humane, it just goes against common sense\u201d (p. 3). A cog in a repressive system, his uncommon sense seems to allow him to preserve and exercise his humanity, albeit contorted under these conditions. But times and society are changing\u2014with new technology\u2014and, consequently, humans are changing, too\u2014into technicians\u2014such that room for the sort of oddly imaginative logic that has kept his inner world and humanity intact and alive thus far is being squeezed out.Too Loud of Solitude (1976) by Bohumil Hrabal, translated from the Czech by Michael Henry Heim, published by Harcourt (1990)."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great Condition"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "this book underscores the greatness that is inherent in every individual. great book not mention the intricate details that come alive through beautiful choice of words carefully chosen by the author"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of the best books I have ever read.

I think this is because it has virtually no narrative flow leaving the reader minimal background story against which to make sense of Hrabal's quirky, irreverent existential angst.  That said, the thoughts and memories of the book's hero / anti hero traverse widely from the sewers of Prague to the heavens in an unbroken monologue inspired by the books and paintings he has rescued from the waste packaging plant he operates.  Hanta builds meaning, incongruously making his bales of waste paper beautiful, while storing thousands of liberated books at home at increasing risk of being crushed under their weight.  Hrabal's sardonic style challenges his reader to look beyond the immediate to recognise how love, spirit, hope, friendship and sacrifice make Hanta into the unlikely Everyman."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The book is fantastic.Though, the kindle version needs extensive proof-reading, editing, and formatting.

Hrabal, whom Milan Kundera calls \u201cour very best writer today,\u201d celebrates the power and the indestructibility of the written word. \r\n\r\nOne of Czechoslovakia's most popular authors, Hrabal ( I Served the King of England ) was never a dissident, nor are his books polemics; he is noted for his visceral, fabulistic prose and bizarre sense of humor. Hanta, the narrator of this absorbing novella, is a gentle alcoholic who has spent 35 years compacting wastepaper. \r\n\r\nIn his messy, subterranean world, the refuse of human life accumulates: bloody butcher paper, office correspondence, yellowed newspapers and, most importantly, books. Able to quote Kant, Goethe and Seneca, he is both \"artist and audience\" as he destroys or selects for his own enjoyment the printed matter others have discarded. \r\n\r\nHanta's unusual occupation--in a country which until recently suffered severe literary censorship--is an ironic backdrop as he reflects on the women he has loved or imaginary encounters between historical figures such as Jesus Christ and Lao-tze. \r\n\r\nThis fable about the modern-day equivalent of book-burning, although a showcase for Hrabal's dazzling writing talent, often slides into parody, under the weight of its obtrusive morality.
