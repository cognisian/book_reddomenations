Historical fiction based on fact is my most favorite genre. Although I liked this book, I did not love it. There was something missing from what I would consider a great HF novel. Maybe because it was wrapped up in the legal issues, or maybe because the characters as described by the author just didn\u2019t grab me, but there was something off in my estimation. When I think of great historical fiction, something I would rate five stars would be on the order of Robert Harris\u2019s Cicero trilogy. Cicero certainly would have been a boring subject, but somehow Robert Harris turned it into the most fascinating story one could imagine. This novel was somewhat interesting but not just not engrossing. I always hate to be too critical when I know the author has done extensive research but I just could not rate this novel any higher."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "After reading this I passed it on to my husband - we both enjoyed the story and the setting.

Gas lamps still flicker in the city streets, but the miracle of electric light is in its infancy. The person who controls the means to turn night into day will make history\u2014and a vast fortune. A young untested lawyer named Paul Cravath, fresh out of Columbia Law School, takes a case that seems impossible to win. Paul\u2019s client, George Westinghouse, has been sued by Thomas Edison over a billion-dollar question: Who invented the light bulb and holds the right to power the country?\r\n \r\nThe case affords Paul entry to the heady world of high society\u2014the glittering parties in Gramercy Park mansions, and the more insidious dealings done behind closed doors. The task facing him is beyond daunting. Edison is a wily, dangerous opponent with vast resources at his disposal\u2014private spies, newspapers in his pocket, and the backing of J. P. Morgan himself. Yet this unknown lawyer shares with his famous adversary a compulsion to win at all costs. How will he do it?\r\n \r\nIn obsessive pursuit of victory, Paul crosses paths with Nikola Tesla, an eccentric, brilliant inventor who may hold the key to defeating Edison, and with Agnes Huntington, a beautiful opera singer who proves to be a flawless performer on stage and off. As Paul takes greater and greater risks, he\u2019ll find that everyone in his path is playing their own game, and no one is quite who they seem.\r\n \r\n\u201cIn The Last Days of Night, Graham Moore takes us back to the dawn of light\u2014electric light\u2014into a world of invention and skulduggery, populated by the likes of Edison, Westinghouse, Tesla, and the novel\u2019s hero, a young lawyer named Paul Cravath (a name that will resonate with ambitious law students everywhere).
