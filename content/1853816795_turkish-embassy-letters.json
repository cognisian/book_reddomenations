Her fifty-two Turkish letters were published to wide acclaim in 1763, one year after her death.1717 | AdrianopleThe Corset StaysI was here convinced of the truth of a reflection I had often made\u2014that if it was the fashion to go naked, the face would be hardly observed. I perceived that the ladies with the finest skins and most delicate shapes had the greatest share of my admiration, though their faces were sometimes less beautiful than those of their companions.In short, it is the women\u2019s coffee house, where all the news of the town is told, scandal invented, etc. They generally take this diversion once a week and stay there at least four or five hours, without getting cold by immediately coming out of the hot bath into the cold room, which was very surprising to me.The lady that seemed the most considerable among them entreated me to sit by her and would fain have undressed me for the bath. I excused myself with some difficulty. They being all so earnest in persuading me, I was at last forced to open my shirt and show them my stays, which satisfied them very well\u2014for they believed I was so locked up in that machine, that it was not in my own power to open it, which contrivance they attributed to my husband. I was charmed with their civility and beauty and should have been very glad to pass more time with them.Robert C.

Lady Mary was an English aristocrat who travelled to Constantinople in 1716 with her husband, Edward, who had been appointed Ambassador to the Turkish court in order to try to broker a peace deal between it and the Viennese court of the Habsburgs.  He failed in this mission but, as a result of it, later generations of readers were treated to his wife\u2019s observations of a culture that was so foreign to her own. In her letters to her friends and family back home, she enlightened them on subjects such as the treatment of Jews in the Turkish empire (they were a very powerful element in it); the brutal attitude shown by the Turkish army to the common people, who were often left destitute after soldiers had been through their lands; the position of women in Turkish society; and the wonders of Turkish architecture, so utterly different from that in her own country. She chose her topics according to whom she was writing to.  When communicating with the poet, Alexander Pope, she regaled him with lengthy quotes from Arabian poetry.  When writing to a clergyman, she explained to him the religious beliefs and rituals practiced in Turkey.  And, when writing to her female friends, she took great pains to describe the clothes and hair styles of the local women.  In fact, one of the subjects she dwells on the most in the Letters is the women she met.  She gives lengthy descriptions of the public baths that women used as meeting places, of her visits to various harems, and her attendance at an all-women pre-marriage ceremony conducted in a public bath.  She describes her meetings with the wives of sultans and other great Turkish leaders, and is positively glowing with praise for their great beauty and poise.  The male readers\u2019 imaginations will be set alight by her narratives!  What makes the book so interesting, though, is that Lady Mary also gives her thoughtful opinions on what it is she is observing, whether it is the wearing of the veil, or her view of the practice of war, regularly indulged in by the Turks.  In places, the lengthy sentences indulged in by eighteenth century writers can seem grossly overstated to our modern eye, but that is the only jarring note in what was, after all, penned three hundred years ago.It is obvious, reading the book, that Lady Mary was, at heart, an ardent romanticist.  It is no wonder, then, that some years after her return to stuffy old England, she left again and spent most of the rest of her life in Italy and France. Just under two years spent under the Turkish sun had a profound effect on her.  I would venture to say she was never the same woman again, and it\u2019s a great pleasure to read about the influences which shaped that process."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Thank you for your prompt service and well represented product."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Smooth transaction, on-time delivery, nice book.

Per contra, Lady MWM is common-sensical, less needlessly poetic, but with the sharp, discerning eye of a spy. That is, she is a real writer. I only wish I could read her letters that were burnt, thrown away, locked up, and otherwise held away from us, because they were too much of a muchness. Were they explicit? Or were they merely telling 300 y/old secrets? No one knows, and those who do, aren't telling. But even the letters that survived are a dilly. You feel you are almost there.
