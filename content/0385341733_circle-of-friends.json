This is the first Maeve Binchy book that I have ever read, and in all likelihood, it will be the last.  I found the book too juvenile for my tastes.  This is the kind of book that I would have read as a teenager in middle school, not as a 54-year woman.  The story was just dragging on and on, and I found myself becoming increasingly exasperated.  The characters were both unrealistic and shallow.  I tried to force myself to finish this book, but I simply could not.  This is middle school reading at best."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I think this is my favorite Maeve Binchey book.
