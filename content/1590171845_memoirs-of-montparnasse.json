His semi-fictionalized memoir of 1920s Paris and environs is interesting primarily for the celebrities he allegedly met during his short stay as a layabout student - Hemingway, Bricktop, Richard Le Gallienne, Djuna Barnes, Frank Harris, and a host of others. Fascinating as are some of his adventures, he composed this work from memory, decades after the fact, so one has to wonder how much actually happened or how much he much is elaborated. What's missing here, according to the introduction, are the more sordid details of Glassco's money-making schemes, including work as a 'boy for hire.' Still, anyone looking for a bit of amusement will enjoy Glassco's memoir."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Awesome biography, filled with gossip and revealing stories of 1920's Paris."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A great read"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "JG definitely belonged to the lay-about category so despised by Hemingway. Unlike Hemingway, he seemed to aspire to an illusion of existentialism that was no more than low life; from sexual depradation to prostitution in the wider sense whilst pretending to be an aspiring writer. The memoirs probably capture the excesses of the belle epoque and in that respect are of interest even if fictitious in many instances."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Surprisingly good, interesting,well paced and surprising.

It is also the best and liveliest of the many chronicles of 1920s Paris and the exploits of the lost generation. \r\n\r\nIn 1928, nineteen-year-old John Glassco escaped Montreal and his overbearing father for the wilder shores of Montparnasse. He remained there until his money ran out and his health collapsed, and he enjoyed every minute of his stay. \r\n\r\nRemarkable for their candor and humor, Glassco\u2019s memoirs have the daft logic of a wild but utterly absorbing adventure, a tale of desire set free that is only faintly shadowed by sadness at the inevitable passage of time.", "asin": "1590171845", "rank": "560358", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41nhzZEh0tL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
