Left wing, fairly openly homosexual (when it was illegal) intellectual, finely crafted poets, playwrights and or novelists. And sometimes moving between more than one genre, and even collaborating as writers.Cambridge educated \u2013 though he never finished his degree, Isherwood was drawn to the decadent, artistically modern, politically volatile city of Berlin at the tail end of the twenties and early thirties.In this book, - and in his more well-known one, Goodbye to Berlin \u2013 mainly because it was later turned into the movie, Cabaret \u2013 he recounts his experiences in that city, as political instability intensified, and lines of allegiance became sharply drawn, and the Nazi party, initially regarded as a kind of loony fringe, not to be taken seriously, began its terrifying rise.Isherwood casts himself as William Bradshaw, a young man, eager for the experience of living in another country, earning his living by teaching English to private students. Bradshaw meets the eponymous Mr Norris, striking up a conversation with him as a way to pass time on a long train journey.\u201cAs he spoke he touched his left temple delicately with his finger-tips, coughed, and suddenly smiled. His smile had great charm. It disclosed the ugliest teeth I had ever seen. They were like broken rocks\u201dNorris is another Englishman, middle-aged, dissolute, clearly a not-to-be trusted wheeler-dealer of some kind, but his distinctly eccentric physical persona, and a strangely appealing charm, despite the obvious dishonesty, amuse Bradshaw, and the two form an unlikely friendship. Norris\u2019s fastidious oddness - the wearing of bizarre wigs and an obsessive attention to prinkings and powderings not usually found at that time openly engaged in by English men, certainly not in England, is typical of the Berlin experience \u2013 decadent, sophisticated and utterly unprovincial, which proved alluring about to those seeking a more colourful, even dangerous, European experience. Norris, it later transpires, has predilections for a kind of wholesome sexual deviancy \u2013 he is open about his relations with a dominatrix and her \u2018minder\u2019 a young man who is a member of the Communist Party. It fact Anni, the whore, AND her minder Otto, are regarded as friends by Norris.Political affiliations are centre stage everywhere. Isherwood, and Norris choose the Left, even though Norris is not necessarily, ever, quite what he seems, and may have fingers in many pies, as he also has some friends whose political allegiance seem to belong more naturally to the right.What is marvellous about Isherwood\u2019s writing, a kind of story telling journalism, an exploration of what it was like to be in Berlin, is that although he is undoubtedly writing about a period which became very dark and very dreadful, the second of his Berlin books, particularly, this is the undercurrent, flowing underneath a brilliant, light-touch observation. A sense of frenetic life, liveliness, wit and urbanity drive the book along, there is certainly more than a touch of fiddling whilst Rome burns about the Weimar republic.Norris himself is a quite extraordinary creation, and, just as Bradshaw is Isherwood\u2019s novelising himself, Norris has a real origin \u2013 a friend of Isherwood\u2019s, Gerald Hamilton, also a writer, and once known as \u2018the wickedest man in Europe\u2019. Hamilton was served time in prison for bankruptcy, theft, being a threat to national security, and, interestingly, numbered amongst his friends not only Isherwood himself, but the unlikely combination of Winston Churchill and Aleister Crowley!The reader quite falls, as Bradshaw does, under his dubious charm, and it is a strange experience to find oneself appreciating the strange moral ambiguity of someone who would undoubtedly sell his own grannie to the highest bidder, yet, somehow, even whilst grannie might even know that herself, he comes across as naughty, rather than vicious. Or, as Isherwood/Bradshaw puts it, so much more elegantly at the start of the novel:\u201cMy first impression was that the stranger\u2019s eyes were of an unusually light blue. They met mine for several blank seconds, vacant, unmistakably scared. Startled and innocently naughty, they half reminded me of an incident I couldn\u2019t quite place; something which had happened a long time ago, to do with the upper fourth classroom. They were the eyes of a schoolboy surprised in the act of breaking one of the rules. Not that I had caught him, apparently, at anything except his own thoughts; perhaps he imagined I could read them\u201d"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This novel -- almost a novella -- was originally published in the US edition of \"The Berlin Stories\" with \"Goodbye to Berlin\" so if you own that original volume, you're set.

How cruel youth is, was too delicate to go to school, had a house full of bronzed boys who played practical jokes on him, beautiful things-the flesh cannot give us happiness, only the spirit, `So particular..more like a lady than a gentleman', thinning eyebrows, not plucking, never shaves himself, potions and lotions, a suit for every day, nine years' money spent in two and silk underclothes.Baron (Kuno) von Pregnitz wears a monocle, `tortured himself daily on an electric horse', has `taken a great fancy to you', his `foot pressed on mine under the table, his `hand took mine under the fur rug' in car, invites him in, he devoted himself entirely to the shy boy PietThen there's the politics of the period: election posters being written over with different candidates, \"Are you of true Aryan descent?\", \"Had they no national pride to be mixing with Jews who were ruining their countries?\" \"There's lots of old scores being paid off nowadays.\"Many are in exile: the vagrant and exiled status. `I couldn't change into a different character; therefore I must change my domicile' - Davidson. The pursuit of lifestyle requires a journey away from British class system - the world at large is their finishing school. Is the tourist more a parasite than a pioneer? `The type of tourist who takes in the whole of Rome in one day.' There is aloneness and separation, the search for a homeland, the sexual rebel. Isherwood later contrasts his sinful European self with his redeemed American Vedanta self.Social Class: British fiction is invariably considered from a middle/upper class male point of view. The working class male may be an object of desire but is rarely the protagonist. `Christopher's kind are able to adventure outside their own class and society.' The new kind of homosexual is accepting, proud and defiant.Regarding older men, there is a fascination with eccentricities in portraying individuals whom respectable society would shun, especially comic pathos of older men. In later novels they are portrayed more fully as individuals, not just as pawns in the game against `the others'. Narrators are often weak characters fascinated by strength of character - the popular image of the homosexual male"}]}, "authors": ["Christopher Isherwood"], "isbn": "0811220265", "longitude":

eyes with Arthur Norris, an irresistibly comical fellow Englishman wearing a rather obvious wig and nervous about producing his passport at the frontier. So begins a friendship conducted in the seedier quarters of the city, where Norris runs a dubious import-export business and lives in excited fear of his bullying secretary, his creditors, and his dominatrix girlfriend, Anni. \r\n\r\nAs the worldwide economic Depression strangles the masses and the Communists make a desperate stand against Fascism and war, Norris sells himself as political orator, spy, and double agent.
