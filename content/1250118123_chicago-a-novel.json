Brian puts the reader into his world, where you feel you are a resident of the apartment complex.

Doyle is an amazing writer.  He is very detail oriented, so at the end of the description you know exactly what he is talking about - it is like you are there.  I kept forgetting that Edward is a dog as he writes as if he is a person.  My first introduction to B Doyle was Mink River - another amazing book.  Thanks again to my wonderful cousin for introducing me to Doyle.I highly recommend Chicago to readers who like:  very descriptive writing, well written and well researched stories, Chicago, great fiction, and amazing use of words."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I was enthralled while reading this book and keep it by my bed so I can re-read portions of it for inspiration. Brian Doyle created a fictional world where miraculous and ordinary things are coexist seamlessly, and he nails the goodness that is at the core of Chicagoans. It's the first work of Brain Doyle's I've run across and has so much heart. I lived in Chicago as a very young child and again as a young adult, and it was a wonder for me to read a novel that recaptures so much of the inner life of the city as it was in the 1970s."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Wonderfully evocative novel about Chicago. Plot-wise it's just an account of five years living here, but in terms of nuance, fabulous vignettes and the overall feel of this book, it is a must for every Chicagoan, former Chicagoan and would-be Chicagoan.
