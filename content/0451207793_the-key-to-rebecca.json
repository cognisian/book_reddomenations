As with this book, I thoroughly enjoyed his character development and interplay. His plot line and actions are believable and, as a result, the story moves very quickly. He also sprinkles a few quirky character traits that lighten the story so as to avoid the potential monotony of non-stop action. So, you might ask, what was it that I didn't like so much about this particular novel? In a nutshell, it was his heavy use of sex. I just didn't appreciate the detail into which he went. I felt that it distracted from what would, for me, have been an even better story without it. Would I recommend \"The Key to Rebecca\" to anyone interested in a WW2 spy thriller? Absolutely, but with a caution."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "good book love ken follet"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Well written interesting story that covers that time period beautifully.

Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, September 1942\r\n\r\nHe is known to the Germans as 'Sphinx', to others as Alex Wolff, a European businessman. He arrives suddenly in Cairo from out of the desert, armed with a radio set, a lethal blade and a copy of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca - a ruthless man with a burning, relentless conviction that he will win at all costs.\r\n\r\nThe stakes are high, for the survival of the British campaign in North Africa is in the balance. Only Major William Vandam, an intelligence officer, and the beautiful courtesan Elene can put an end to Wolff's brilliant clandestine reports of British troop movements and strategic plans.\r\n\r\nAs Rommel's troops come closer to victory, Vandam edges nearer to Wolff and the crucial key. Follett builds tension and suspense to a nerve-tearing pitch as he follows the adversaries across the infernal desert to a confrontation which will determine who wins - and loses - in this deathly struggle.\r\n\r\n\"From the opening sentence to the gripping climax...Ken Follett delivers the surefire suspense readers have come to expect.\" Los Angeles Times\r\n", "asin": "0451207793", "rank": "52600", "city": "Cairo", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PjZw9EsaL.jpg", "country": "Egypt", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
