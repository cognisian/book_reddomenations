Not just anything... this particular book.I ATE the pages with my eyes !I PRAYED it would never end !!I LOVED every single chapter and metaphor !!!Something tells me the circumstances in which I read it were crucial to this perception.

This wise and rapturous book is the story of how she left behind all these outward marks of success, and set out to explore three different aspects of her nature, against the backdrop of three different cultures: pleasure in Italy, devotion in India, and on the Indonesian island of Bali, a balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence.", "asin": "0143038419", "rank": "6383", "city": "Rome", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jxVQo-S8L.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
