Turns out the man had a long and productive life before Hollywood came calling.  I read a long section of Billy The Kid and did not understand what I had. Ondaatje has captured the rough and raw life of the Wild West in a collection of fragments of short stories, poems, interviews, and memories. We crash from here to there in a whimsical search for more words and paper.Billy the Kid and Pat Garrett were long-time friends and collaborators. Eventually Pat became a law man and put an end to Billy's short mad life of crime. A lot of others got in the way also without good results.  The book has Billy reflecting on Pat and their relationship, Billy listing the men he killed, and Billy describing how members of the gang met their end.  Usually I am not a fan of the Western genre but this collection really resonates.  Unfortunately it is as short and colorful as Billy."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Another imaginative exploration into the prose/poetry of this author. This time he has taken the reader up and into excerpts, narratives, poems, and  voices of all those who shared the short, tense life of this hero/villain of the 1880s.There no sequential framework but rather, points of view, emotions, intentions of Billy\u2019s friends-gang and Garrett\u2019s friends-posse-gang; as well as various women Billy knew. There are descriptions of horses and dogs. And of course, Billy himself. There is an interview, newspaper articles, a play, songs, reminiscences after his death. This book pushes and pulls the reader into the compelling, short life of the romantic hero/vicious killer, William Bonney.The imagination, the  freedom of writing styles, the magical use of language of Michael Ondaatje is amazing."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A mongrel work, as Ondaatje calls it and that is the perfect form with which to resuscitate the simplistic vision of the American west and to bring it alive with all its heat, it's drunkenness, it's rawness and it's madness."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Interesting, short read.

This revolutionary collage of poetry and prose, layered with photos, illustrations and \u201cclippings,\u201d astounded Canada and the world when it was first published in 1969. It earned then-little-known Ondaatje his first of several Governor General\u2019s Awards and brazenly challenged the world\u2019s notions of history and literature. \r\n\r\nOndaatje\u2019s Billy the Kid (aka William H. Bonney / Henry McCarty / Henry Antrim) is not the clich\u00e9d dimestore comicbook gunslinger later parodied within the pages of this book. Instead, he is a beautiful and dangerous chimera with a voice: driven and kinetic, he also yearns for blankness and rest. A poet and lover, possessing intelligence and sensory discernment far beyond his life\u2019s 21 year allotment, he is also a resolute killer. His friend and nemesis is Sheriff Pat Garrett, who will go on to his own fame (or infamy) for Billy\u2019s execution. Himself a web of contradictions, Ondaatje\u2019s Garrett is \u201ca sane assassin sane assassin sane assassin sane assassin sane assassin sane\u201d (p. 29) who has taught himself a language he\u2019ll never use and has trained himself to be immune to intoxication. As the hero and anti-hero engage in the counterpoint that will lead to Billy\u2019s predetermined death, they are joined by figures both real and imagined, including the homesteaders John and Sallie Chisum, Billy\u2019s lover Angela D, and a passel of outlaws and lawmakers. The voices and images meld, joined by Ondaatje\u2019s own, in a magnificent polyphonic dream of what it means to feel and think and freely act, knowing this breath is your last and you are about to be trapped by history.\r\n", "asin": "067976786X", "rank": "474314", "city": "New Mexico", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZuS2hA4yL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
