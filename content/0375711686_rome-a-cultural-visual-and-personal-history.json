From there, he goes back more than two thousand years to the city\u2019s foundation, one mired in mythologies and superstitions that would inform Rome\u2019s development for centuries. He explores in rich detail the formation of empire, the rise of early Christianity, the Crusades, the Renaissance, and takes us up to the present, through the rise and fall of Mussolini\u2019s fascism. Equal parts idolizing, blasphemous, outraged, and awestruck, Rome is a portrait of the Eternal City as only Robert Hughes could paint it.", "asin": "0375711686", "rank": "112875", "city": "Rome", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51X32RygzVL.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
