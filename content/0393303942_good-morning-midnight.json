There is a definitive gloomy, fatalistic, disillusioned approach to Sasha\u2019s narrative, as she tries to not only drink herself to death, but meditates on the failed experiences of love and hope. To say that Rhys\u2019 novel is a tad depressing is a bit of an understatement, but amongst the bleakness and gloom, there is a definite introspective look into the character of Sasha, and I think Rhys certainly captures the overall sense of nihilism that encapsulates the entire narrative.Jean Rhys captures the alienation and lack of identity of Sasha with such lyrical accuracy. Here is one such example: \u201cI am empty of everything. I am empty of everything but the thin, frail trunks of the trees and the thin, frail ghosts in my room.\u201dAs our narrator sheds more light on her past\u2014and present\u2014condition, we learn all the failings of her personal life she had to endure. We get bits and pieces of her life in a fragmentary, stream-of-consciousness type of narration, and we get a sense that her downward spiral has contributed to her drinking habits and over all bleak frame of mind.I think this quite possibly (next to Ethan Frome) might be the single most depressing book I\u2019ve ever read. I do think Rhys captures what she intends to capture, and there certainly is a lyrical almost poetic, style to her writing that is impressive. But, wow, I had to set this book down every now and then just to be able to endure it for the long haul. If you read, you might want to read another book alongside, something opposite this one; you know, something happy and cheery."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Good Morning, Midnight is a book that will stay with me for a while.

So it took a bit for me to get into the book, plus it\u2019s about a woman who is spiraling into madness. And I think I\u2019m overly emphatic because the book just added to my own depression. And spoiler! the book doesn\u2019t have a happy ending. I know that I\u2019m not painting a positive review of the book, but I liked it. I would just say if you are someone who is an empathetic reader, you may want to read this in the summer when the sun is shinning, and it\u2019s maybe easier to find a happy place while reading it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I wanted a hardcover copy of this book, and this 1969 printing of it was the only one I could find."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Fascinating that the best portraits of despairing women in 1930s France were written by Scott Fitzgerald (\u201cTender Is the Night\u201d) and Jean Rhys (\u201cGood Morning, Midnight\u201d).  Both were self-exiled English-speakers drawn to France, where they found the perfect setting for female characters who struggled on, hopelessly.  Fitzgerald\u2019s novels may have had a broader canvas, but for deep penetration into the soul of sadness, Rhys is superior.  \u201cGood Morning, Midnight\u201d is a brief stream of the consciousness of Sasha Jensen, who has run out of options in London and returned to the scene of earlier downfalls, Paris.  She is profoundly disappointed by men, close to penniless, well aware that she is turning into a raddled old drunk.  She lurches from one bound-to-fail relationship to another.  However, the conclusion is not death in a gutter, as you might imagine.  Why read page after page anatomizing self-destructiveness?  Where a random search yields lines like: \u201cWhat is she (Sasha herself) doing here?  I have seen that in people\u2019s eyes all my life.\u201d  You read on because you can\u2019t take your eyes off this train wreck, it\u2019s so damned well written.  \u201cI often want to cry,\u201d Sasha says.  \u201cThat is the only advantage women have over men\u2014at least they can cry.\u201d  Rhys wrote several other books in this existentialist vein, and should be regarded as one of the finest writers of the 20th century."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I enjoyed the reading."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Ok book at best"}]}, "authors": ["Jean Rhys"], "isbn": "0393303942", "longitude": 2.3514992, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "Good Morning, Midnight", "word_cloud": "fact think get entirely different name excellent character fully develop seem totally infuse self follow wandering perspective back definitive gloomy fatalistic disillusion approach narrative try drink death meditates fail experience hope tad depress bit understatement among st bleakness gloom definite introspective look character think certainly capture overall sense nihilism encapsulate entire capture alienation lack identity lyrical accuracy here example empty everything empty everything thin frail trunk tree thin frail ghost narrator shed light learn failing personal life endure get bit piece life fragmentary type narration get sense downward spiral contribute drink habit bleak frame think quite possibly next single depressing ever think capture intend capture certainly lyrical almost poetic style write impressive wow set able endure long haul alongside something opposite know something happy cheery stream consciousness first person narrative sad lonely main character page want know want understand reason choose drink life away disappoint love copy want share experience much like modernist writer tend write stream consciousness style bit difficult take bit get woman spiral madness think overly emphatic add depression spoiler happy end know paint positive review like someone empathetic summer sun shin maybe easier find happy place reading want hardcover copy print fascinate best portrait despair woman write draw find perfect set female character struggle hopelessly novel canvas deep penetration soul sadness superior brief stream consciousness option return scene earlier downfall profoundly disappoint men close penniless well aware turn raddled old drunk lurch relationship however conclusion death gutter page page anatomize random search yield line see people eye eye wreck damn well write often want cry say advantage woman least write several existentialist vein regard finest writer century enjoy read ok best", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Women's Fiction"], "summary": "Sasha Jensen has returned to Paris, the city of both her happiest moments and her most desperate.
