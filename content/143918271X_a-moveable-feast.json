This is contained in the ending section entitled \u201cfragments,\u201d Hemingway\u2019s various drafts for an introduction.Here are some of the sentences that Mary Hemingway did not want to see published:\u201cI have left out much and changed and eliminated and I hope Hadley understands. She is the heroine and the only person who had a life that turned out well and as it should except certain of the rich.\u201d \u201cShe deserves everything good in life including accurate reporting.\u201d\u201cThere is never any end to Paris but maybe this will give you some true part of the people and places and the country when Hadley and I believed that we were invulnerable and that was the end of the first part of Paris.\u201dIt is in the \u201cPilot and the Rich\u201d chapter near the book\u2019s end, that Hemingway admits he fell for the wealthy charms of his second wife Pauline, ruining the innocence of his true love for Hadley. While the Great Depression prices of the 1920s, when the dollar had enormous value against the weak French Franc, made it possible for Hemingway and Hadley and their son Bumby to survive and even live part of the year in Swiss hotels, Pauline\u2019s wealth allowed him the financial security to write fiction full-time, a situation he had not enjoyed with Hadley, when he had to make frequent trips away from her to cover post World War I diplomatic conferences as a journalist, because they needed the money. When I began reading Hemingway in the 1970s he was being dismissed as a male chauvinist whose female characters were inhumanly shallow and whose real talent was as a pretentious food critic, so replete were his novels filled with descriptions of good food and fine wine.Yet by the 1980s I was reading Simone de Beauvoir, the greatest feminist of them all, a writer who not only admired Hemingway but did so to a degree that she modeled her own literary style after his. Female readers today, the beneficiary of an unintended feminist revival, single-handedly achieved by the boorish degrading of women by Donald Trump, can now reevaluate \u201cA Moveable Feast\u201d through the prism of time.The prism of time reveals a Hemingway in these pages apologizing for his own, at times, overbearing, boorish, selfish behavior, and makes clear he understood that Hadley had sacrificed her own career as a pianist to his as a writer. In this startling admission of his desertion of Hadley, he writes, \u201cHe had the irreplaceable early training of a bastard and a latent and long denied love of money.\u201dHemingway portrays the rich Pauline as a stalker of talent, not uncommon in the arts world. He\u2019s not accusing her of being a \u201ctraditional home wrecker,\u201d but rather a rich woman buying the innocent happiness of the na\u00efve, the na\u00efve being he and Hadley.\u201cWhen you have two people who love each other, are happy and gay and really good work is being done by one or both of them, people are drawn to them as surely as migrating birds at night to a powerful beacon.\u201d Of course, this is more than a comment on the rich buying what they want. It is a universal observation that the unhappy will destroy the happiness of others, or try to acquire it, in a kind of corporate takeover, as it were.In one of the most remorseful confessions in world literature, Hemingway owns up to his abandonment of Hadley, his one true love:\u201cWhen the husband is a writer and doing difficult work on a book so that he is occupied much of the time and is not a good companion or partner to his wife for a big part of the day, the arrangement has advantages until you know how it works out. The husband has two attractive girls around when he has finished work. One is new and strange and if he has bad luck he gets to love them both. Then the one who is relentless wins.\u201cThe wife does not know about it and trusts the husband. The new one says you cannot really love her if you love your wife too. She does not say that at the start. That comes later when the murder\u2019s done.\u201dYou might say that Hemingway got what he deserved for leaving Hadley for the new and exciting and variety and wealth of Pauline, and many have. And you and they may be right.Yet to call leaving your first wife for your second wife \u201cmurder\u201d is a metaphor that shows a level of contrition that is extraordinary and brutally honest to a degree that few men could own up to. And demonstrates the extreme sensitivity that made Hemingway, good and bad, what he was as a writer and man.These updates and observations about the \u201crestored\u201d \u201cA Moveable Feast\u201d do not, of course, explain the unique charm of the stories and why you may have read the original edition and now will read this one.Despite grumblings over the years of how rude certain Parisians or Parisian waiters may have been, I have NEVER, EVER, heard anybody say Paris is not a beautiful, haunting, inviting city.That is the advantage Hemingway works from in his delightful descriptions of the city which is the core of this classic book. You, the reader, may now begin:\u201cThen there was the bad weather. It would come in one day when the fall was over. You would have to shut the windows in the night against the rain and the cold wind would strip the leaves from the trees in the Place Contrescarpe.\u201d[Hansen Alexander\u2019s new work of creative nonfiction is HOW THE LIONS ATE TIM TEBOW.]"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This memoir of Hemingway\u2019s time in Paris in the early 1920s contains observations on writing and writers, comments on members of the \u201clost generation,\u201d snippets of life in Paris, and reflections on the impact these years in Paris had on Hemingway\u2019s later life.  This is the \u201crestored edition,\u201d which includes additional material not in the original edition edited by Hemingway\u2019s fourth (and final) wife Mary.  Editor and Hemingway grandson Se\u00e1n Hemingway provides a nice introduction describing the differences between this edition and the original one, and the reasons for his editorial decisions.  He also captures nicely what writing is all about when he notes Hemingway\u2019s \u201cability to discern the gold from the dross and turn his observations into prose,\u201d an ability which Hemingway first developed during the time remembered in this book.Ernest and his wife Hadley were poor, but Hemingway mentions more than once how happy they were.  He also notes how being hungry \u201csharpens all of your perceptions,\u201d so that even paintings are viewed differently.  Apparently there is nothing quite like going to a museum on an empty stomach, though Hemingway also emphasizes the importance of finding routes through the city that do not take one past restaurants or bakeries that would simply intensify the hunger pangs.Of course, many of Hemingway\u2019s friends and associates (and rivals) in Paris were other writers, artists, or people associated with writing (like Sylvia Beach, who ran the famous Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris but was so much more than a bookshop owner).  His observations on these writers are scattered throughout the book and regularly ground the narrative in the expatriate literary life of Paris during the interwar years.  The poet Ezra Pound is described in completely positive term: generous, loyal, a good friend.  Hemingway\u2019s contempt for Ford Madox Ford, on the other hand, is undisguised, though consciously and admittedly so.  Though Gertrude Stein comes across as pompous, Hemingway\u2019s view of her is generally positive early on, somewhat less so later.  His portrait of F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda is fascinating and more extensive than any others.  Hemingway and Fitzgerald were friends, but while Hemingway clearly admires his best writing, he also thinks he could have done much more.  He is distressed about his friend\u2019s heavy drinking, and is not favorably disposed toward Zelda, whom he describes as envious of Scott\u2019s writing.As one might expect, there are numerous observations about writing, including perhaps most famously Hemingway\u2019s description of the reminder he would deliver to himself when he got stuck in his writing: \u201c\u2019Do not worry.  You have always written before and you will write now.  All you have to do is write one true sentence.  Write the truest sentence you know.\u2019  So finally I would write one true sentence and then go on from there.\u201d  But this is not primarily a book about writing, and many of Hemingway\u2019s other observations are small gems.  About Ezra Pound he notes that \u201che liked the works of his friends, which is beautiful as loyalty but can be disastrous as judgment.\u201d  And there is this brief portrait of the Paris years, which contains volumes in a few words: \u201cBut Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right and wrong nor the breathing of someone who lay in the moonlight beside you.\u201dThere\u2019s a poignancy to some of the writing, with hints of the heartbreak and betrayal that were also part of the Paris years.  Hemingway has the perspective of decades as he writes, but with this hindsight comes a degree of cynicism about younger days and their innocence.  This emerges most noticeably as he casts backward glances (made most obvious in one of the sketches added to this edition) at a simpler time before his first marriage ended as a result of his romance with Pauline, who became his second wife (and was the grandmother of S\u00e9an, editor of this volume).  The final paragraph in the chapter titled \u201cWinters in Schruns\u201d is a remarkable description.  It starts: \u201cThe last year in the mountains new people came deep into our lives and nothing was ever the same again.  The winter of the avalanches was like a happy and innocent winter in childhood compared to that winter and the murderous summer that was to follow.  Hadley and I had become too confident in each other and careless in our confidence and pride.\u201d  Though Hemingway offers no details on \u201cthe bulldozing of three people\u2019s hearts to destroy one happiness and build another,\u201d details are not needed.  The episode is more powerfully described as an almost entirely interior event.I have read only a couple of Hemingway\u2019s novels, but the same straight-ahead writing style that characterized them is found in this memoir.  It serves the purpose well, offering a largely unadorned portrait of a time and a place that were formative for the craft and the sensibilities of the man who, in 1954, became one of the handful of Americans to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "As described.

the 1920s, now available in a restored edition, includes the original manuscript along with insightful recollections and unfinished sketches.\r\n\r\nPublished posthumously in 1964, A Moveable Feast remains one of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s most enduring works. Since Hemingway\u2019s personal papers were released in 1979, scholars have examined the changes made to the text before publication. Now, this special restored edition presents the original manuscript as the author prepared it to be published.\r\n\r\nFeaturing a personal Foreword by Patrick Hemingway, Ernest\u2019s sole surviving son, and an Introduction by grandson of the author, Se\u00e1n Hemingway, editor of this edition, the book also includes a number of unfinished, never-before-published Paris sketches revealing experiences that Hemingway had with his son, Jack, and his first wife Hadley. Also included are irreverent portraits of literary luminaries, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ford Maddox Ford, and insightful recollections of Hemingway\u2019s own early experiments with his craft.\r\n\r\nWidely celebrated and debated by critics and readers everywhere, the restored edition of A Moveable Feast brilliantly evokes the exuberant mood of Paris after World War I and the unbridled creativity and unquenchable enthusiasm that Hemingway himself epitomized.", "asin": "143918271X", "rank": "10353", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lVoALt-2L.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
