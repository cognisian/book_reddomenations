Baldwin's narrative masterfully weaves together a tale that seamlessly moves from events in the past to the present and from characters' back stories in such a way that the reader never gets lost.  The narrative captures the imagination and yet, manages to examine the nature of relationships and money and race in a philosophical manner that never gets preachy or that takes away from or feels misplaced in the story."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Another Country is a very powerful read, both gut wrenching and heart warming.
