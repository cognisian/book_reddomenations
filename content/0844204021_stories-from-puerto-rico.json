Often the translation doesn't correspond to the Spanish. Words are added in, adjectives and whole phrases are left out, things are listed in a different order than they are in the Spanish, etc.Here is one good example of this. I'll keep it to just one, but this sort of thing arises on every page and eventually gets tedious and annoying.Toward the top of page 13 it says, \"Lo sentaron en la orilla.\"  This means, \"They set him/sat him up on the embankment.\"  But the translation on page 12 is, \"They propped him up.\"  That just isn't helpful.So this book could be useful as a study on how to translate smoothly, but it doesn't live up to the promise of a dual language book."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "not what i ordered or wanted"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I have enjoyed the stories and purchased the others in the series and enjoyed them equally as well ... if you purchase one and like it you'll probably like the others (there's also Spain, Mexico, South America/Latin Countries)"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It was on my son's wish list.

These are great teaching tools to use in the English classroom.  This also could be said for those trying to learn or teach Spanish in the States (or PR).  These stories are commmon legends here on the island. Anyone you meet has a different tale or twist to it.  It was nice to read, easy too, and there is an insight to island lore and culture that for outsiders you can get just anywhere.  Enjoy!"}]}, "authors": ["Robert L.
