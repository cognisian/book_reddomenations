That said, it was fun to read the actual facts and events.  Of course, J.G. Ballard went on to write some interesting novels, but, as a young English boy in Shanghai, 1940, he lived the experiences of this book.  Of course, I pictured a young Christian Bale as Jim, and John Malkovich as Basie.  Now, I'm going to watch the movie again to see how Spielberg adapted the book."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Read this while traveling in Japan.

This could have been an interesting book -- Shanghai during the war -- but it never went anyplace.  You know, today this happened;  the next day this happened; and so on and so on.  So, it's the story of a kid \"coming of age\" in a Japanese prison camp.  Big deal.  I've read more than a few \"coming of age\" books as well as prison camp books and this doesn't rate very high.  And the main character, Jim, strikes me as a real pain-in-the-ass kid.  His \"coming of age\" takes him from about eleven to, oh, let's say 12...I kept getting the feeling I was missing something but by the time I got to the end of the book (and the movie)  I realized I wasn't missing anything.  I'm sure the book was authentic, but at no time did it spike my emotions or provide me with any real suspense.  After reading the other reviews, I simply have to say that this book is overrated."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Empire du Soleil c'est une aventure formidable, cette histoire-nouvelle de JG Ballard, bas\u00e9e sur ses memoires de Shanghai comme un jeune homme imprisonn\u00e9 pour les japonais au cours de la deuxi\u00e8me guerre mondiale.Actually I ordered Empire of the Sun in English, but was shipped the French version by mistake (although the image for the English version still shows Empire du Soleil), and the book seller promptly refunded my payment."}]}, "authors": ["J.
