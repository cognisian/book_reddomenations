Time has forgotten this book.The quality of the book itself was questionable. But the quality of what the book contained however is not. The story is immeasurable. However the story itself is timeless. As days go by and Presidents come and go. Each day we see \"Big Brother\" take a little big more \"thought control\" and that is something that Orwell so masterfully broadcast in this novel of his. Amazing piece of literature to be sure. Do not look for a happy ending. There is not one.

He goes on to write his own book to oppose the party through his own thoughts and ideas, these are my favorite parts of the book:1. Even idiocy is seen as intelligence2. The poor would learn to become literate, think for themselves and would eventually take over thus, creating a hierarchical society3. \u201cI hate purity, I hate goodness, I wish everyone were corrupt to the bones as we are!\u201d4.
