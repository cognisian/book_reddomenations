Nor should it have to try to be--if Gatsbys were a dime a dozen, the literary sphere would be a much different place. This novel does indeed suffer from occasional prosiness, an attitude that is perhaps too bleak, and a cast of characters you probably wouldn't want to speak to even if you were paid for your time. But it also contains moments of brilliant lyricism almost on par with some of the writing in Gatsby, and although you wouldn't necessarily want to befriend its cast of characters, their struggles and situations are universal to all of us.This is a novel about rich white people in the years around WW1 suffering from ennui, and if you can't handle that sort of thing as a matter of principle, you should probably look for a different book. The characters are not likeable in any conventional or meaningful sense: they make terrible decisions, say terrible things, and spend much of the novel destroying themselves and one another. That's why it's important that, before you read this, you dispense with the idea that characters need to be likeable to be empathetic. Although we may not relate to the extraordinary amounts of privilege these people possess, we can relate to their habits and attitudes--all of us have gone into slumps, deferred on our responsibilities, spat at the world, and done things that we regret. These are the things that constitute the lives of the characters of this novel. If we find these things to be unlikeable in our characters, maybe that's just because we don't like them in ourselves."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Enjoyed the book as I think he was agteat"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It is the perfect way to show case one of my favorite authors !"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great book!"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "this version read more like a binder than a novel"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "the print is to small!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Anthony Patch is a spoiled alcoholic anti-hero, and no character is admirable.

Scott Fitzgerald's second novel, which brilliantly satirizes a doomed and glamorous marriage, anticipated the master stroke\u2014The Great Gatsby\u2014that would follow, and marks a key moment in the writer\u2019s career. \r\n\r\nWould-be Jazz Age aristocrats Anthony and Gloria Patch embody the corrupt high society of 1920s New York: they are beautiful, shallow, pleasure-seeking, and vain. As presumptive heirs to a large fortune, they begin their married life by living well beyond their means. Their days are marked by endless drinking, dancing, luxury, and play. \r\n\r\nBut when the expected inheritance is withheld, their lives become consumed with the pursuit of wealth, and their alliance begins to fall apart. Inspired in part by Fitzgerald's own tumultuous union with his wife Zelda, hauntingly rendered and keenly observed, these characters evoke a vivid portrait of a lost world: a city steeped in vice, a society without direction, and the rootless and decadent generation that inhabited it.", "asin": "1503295354", "rank": "25090", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51FCTCXaUCL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
