I'm giving this two stars instead of one, because I was interested in the psychological aspect of the children feeling the need to  protect the mother.  If the book had stuck to character development, instead of trailing off into endless and totally confusing ruminations by the narrator, it might have been worthwhile. ( I do admit, however, that she made a good stab at Nugent).The narrator at times just seems very weird.  When she meets her sibling's three year old son for the first time, it is understandable that she might wish to hug the child.  But she wonders:  \"How I will steal or filch permission to rub my cheek along the skin of his back, and PLAY THE BONES OF HIS SPINE (what ????).  The book is chock full of strange sentences like this and that  is not good writing, sorry.The book might have been better if about a hundred pages were lopped off it."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Anne Enright\u2019s The Gathering won the 2007 Mann Booker prize, for the best original novel written in English and published in the UK. The story concerns a large Irish family that gathers to mourn the death of Liam, one of nine children in the Hagerty family. The story is told by one of them, Veronica, who is now an adult with children of her own. The novel consists of a series of short chapters in which Veronica reminisces about her family and relationships, interspersed with her trip to London to recover the body of Liam who committed suicide by drowning himself in the ocean. She starts with grandma Ada who meets one man, Nugent, but in the end marries another, Charlie. Her memory goes back and forth between Ada, Charlie and Nugent, her now dysfunctional marriage with her husband, Tom, her children, her parents, the other siblings, her college boyfriend, Michael Weiss and, of course, Liam. It is a sad story and Veronica is a sad person. The key event that she relates is that Liam was sexually abused when he was eight and she was seven. She witnessed the act but kept it a secret from the rest of the family.I think this novel will especially appeal to Irish people and married women who can identify with Veronica. However I am neither and thus found it hard to relate to what is really a depressing story. It is well written and Ms. Enright clearly deserved her award."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "She flings arrows to your heart. Blasphemy to your soul. Truth over lies over nightmares.

More so, because I happen to have lived in Broadstone and played on the CIE buses and climbed the big oak tree over the wall where I could see who was coming and going in my grandmother's house across the road.  I don't know or remember the type of people/scenes Enright writes about.  I have read halfway through the book, and have to give up on the rest of it.  It's just too awful.

Now she delivers The Gathering, a moving, evocative portrait of a large Irish family and a shot of fresh blood into the Irish literary tradition, combining the lyricism of the old with the shock of the new. \r\n\r\nThe nine surviving children of the Hegarty clan are gathering in Dublin for the wake of their wayward brother, Liam, drowned in the sea. His sister, Veronica, collects the body and keeps the dead man company, guarding the secret she shares with him\u2014something that happened in their grandmother\u2019s house in the winter of 1968. \r\n\r\nAs Enright traces the line of betrayal and redemption through three generations her distinctive intelligence twists the world a fraction and gives it back to us in a new and unforgettable light. \r\n\r\nThe Gathering is a daring, witty, and insightful family epic, clarified through Anne Enright\u2019s unblinking eye. It is a novel about love and disappointment, about how memories warp and secrets fester, and how fate is written in the body, not in the stars.", "asin": "0802170390", "rank": "122634", "city": "Dublin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ago-KR06L.jpg", "country": "Ireland", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
