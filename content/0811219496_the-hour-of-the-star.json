Living in the slums of Rio and eking out a poor living as a typist, Macab\u00e9a loves movies, Coca-Colas, and her rat of a boyfriend; she would like to be like Marilyn Monroe, but she is ugly, underfed, sickly and unloved. Rodrigo recoils from her wretchedness, and yet he cannot avoid the realization that for all her outward misery, Macab\u00e9a is inwardly free/She doesn't seem to know how unhappy she should be. \r\n\r\nLispector employs her pathetic heroine against her urbane, empty narrator\u2015edge of despair to edge of despair\u2015and, working them like a pair of scissors, she cuts away the reader's preconceived notions about poverty, identity, love and the art of fiction. \r\n\r\nIn her last book she takes readers close to the true mystery of life and leave us deep in Lispector territory indeed.", "asin": "0811219496", "rank": "33679", "city": "Rio de Janeiro", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xTGisRwiL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
