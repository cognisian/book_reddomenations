Whether you'll enjoy this or not depends on if you like a firm 1990's setting and are captivated by the authors writing style along with his slant on things- eye for satire his own particular brand of humor- the critics love him and alot of readers that enjoy something not exactly predictable or standard in style also pick him up."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of my absolute favorite books. The jumps between NY and the Southwest + the way memory, landscape, art and the distance between years and human relationships are captured is just outstanding. Highly recommended."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The opening sentence is a doozy: \"He speaks in your voice, American, and there's a shine in his eye that's halfway hopeful.\"This is an epic poem of a novel that opens with an account of a 1951 baseball game (which coincides with the Soviets' atomic bomb test) and ends many decades later in the ashes of the Cold War. That opening chapter is spectacular, and the ball from the game-ending home run becomes a talisman, an symbol-laden beacon guiding us forward and back in time. Along the way we spend time with bookies, conceptual artists, nuns, street hoods, celebrities, heroin-addicted pool sharks, math teachers, homeless gay graffiti artists, serial killers, Lenny Bruce and J. Edgar Hoover (among many others).The themes are enormous and the artistry of the writing made me take my time absorbing its nearly 900 pages. Many times I re-read a paragraph to deconstruct how the hell DeLillo did it. The elliptical dialogue is brilliant and made me wish he also wrote plays.I guess Pynchon and Wallace (Infinite Jest) are the obvious comparisons, but DeLillo has a humanity and grace those two lack. Though often brilliantly funny, there\u2019s an elegiac, mournful pedal tone running beneath it; as the relative innocence and simple (though existential) fears of the early Cold War are swapped, at a slow drip, for the complex, cynical ironies of today.To me, Underworld was like a great love affair; it wasn\u2019t always easy, its heightened joys matched by the depths of sadness, its beauty interrupted by flashes of ugliness. I\u2019ll never read it again but I\u2019ll look back on it with a smile on my face and a lump in my throat.It\u2019s about baseball, the atom bomb and the Bronx. And the many ways we\u2019ve tried through the years, successfully or not, to dispose of the detritus of our collective and private past."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "nd then I read this book and now I'm afraid to read more. I will definitely be taking a break. This book starts with an absolutely brilliantly told baseball game. If you read no other part of this book (and I don't recommend you do) I definitely recommend the prologue.After that, the book takes a lot of turns all of them reminding me of the little bit I read of [book:Infinite Jest|6759]. Instead of tennis there was baseball, instead of insurance there was trash collection, and there was a movie whose relevance I don't really understand but which was described in detail. Don't write a book to describe a movie within the book. (Pretty sure there was a thing about a movie in IJ.)It was a SLOG to get through. NOTHING happened, I listened to it and spaced out more times than I care to mention and when I got back into it I just didn't care to go back and listen to what I missed. 800 pages of nothingness led us to an understanding of what happened to the main character when he was a kid, and it was just sad and disappointing. Also, HATED HIM and everybody else in the book (that may be partially attributable to the narrator.)Starting to think I should give this one star.I can see WHY this was nominated for an award, and can see why it won. Award people like blather. Nicole does not."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "What to make of \u2018Underworld\u201d. That is a question that followed me in the week it took for me to read the book. Reading it, I thought of both John Dos Passos and William Faulkner for the style and the breadth of the vision contained in the book. Faulkner captured the essence of the American south or the late 19th and early 20th centuries in his novels. Dos Passos with the USA trilogy and the Mid-Century novel traced the evolution of the American culture in the first half of the 20th century. Both used an elliptical non-linear style to illuminate their themes.  Underworld does the same in its goal of tracing the path of the American culture in the second half of the 20th century.This is a wonderful novel. I had read reviews here that it is difficult to read and that there is no plot to follow. I did not find this in my reading and I would urge people to give the novel a chance."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Incredible prose.
