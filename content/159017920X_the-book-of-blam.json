The consequent racial suspicions, which leave no one untouched, are real: Hungarians, Jews, Serbians, all are caught in the ideological swirl which, as we know, had devastating consequences for the people of the region: pogroms, the invasion  by Arrow Cross Hungarians, the murder of communists (Blam's sister)...The novel also delves into the unconscious of violent retribution, something which, as we have learned in recent years, only leads to the perpetuation of violence.  Mr. Tisma must have had the wars that raged throughout the 90s in mind (i.e., Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina) while he was writing his novel. (The precariousness of the region, of which we are all aware, is in part the result of a failure to put the past behind, to let go, to forgive.) The dream-like scenes, where long-dead friends of Blam's pay their executioners in kind, are harrowing.A short novel about a region of the world whose history we unfortunately know too little about, and but one tiny chapter in the book of horrors that were visited upon the European Jewish community."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The Book of Blam is a wonderful book and an important book. It recounts the events during the Holocaust period in what is now Serbia. After reading this and Tisma's Kapo, he has a style of writing that is unlike most  writers that I have read from Eastern Europe; concise, flowing storylines  and easy to read. His story has been told many times before but there is  something to Tisma's writing that makes Genocide appear as normal to these  killers as washing their hands or going for a walk.  His is a voice of  reason in Novi Sad, a city with little tolerance then and now. After the  events in the Balkans during the recent past, sad to say, not much has  changed."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is the literary equivalent and then some of the photographic essay \"A Vanished World\" and Anne Frank's diary in 1950, had she survived.

This excellent novel, written by a man who experienced the human or inhuman tragedies of Novi Sad in the  1930's and 1940's helped me get a feeling for this city.
