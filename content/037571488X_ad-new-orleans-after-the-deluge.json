(Note -- the flap says \"seven stories\", but it seemed to me that the couple's viewpoint was mostly that of the guy, and the two friends' was mostly that of Abbas.) Point of view aside, this book creates a powerful impression of \"what it was like\". The most dramatic stories are those of the people who suffered most -- Denise, and Abbas and Darnell -- but the others add to the strength of the overall impression. The graphics are particularly gripping early on, when the storm and the flooding are happening, but they work on many levels throughout the book. Someone criticized this book as being politically slanted -- how could it not be, considering what happened? I don't think it was slanted at all, I think it tells what happened."}]}, "authors": ["Josh Neufeld"], "isbn": "037571488X", "longitude": -90.0701156, "periods": ["2000s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "A.D.: New Orleans After the Deluge", "word_cloud": "someone make money go museum see blank canvas artist revere same thing involve big city people want survival stress elsewhere money clump people produce feckless desire rescue produce collective experience agitated haggish produce slime apartment drench destruction huge collection comic flood rat tree car park front store begin never see water rise roof shed building people die terrible phone service quality great son collage love amaze graphic journalism sort finest hundred panel superb job conjure chaos event midst focus true story handful survivor find rivet start finish contemporary relevant graphic gift story unique presentation graphic look aftermath different viewpoint note flap say story seem couple viewpoint mostly guy friend mostly view aside create powerful impression dramatic story people suffer others add strength overall impression graphic particularly grip early storm flood happen work many level criticize politically slant consider happen think slant think tell happen", "genres": ["Biography", "Comics & Graphic Novels", "Politics"], "summary": "Now in paperback, The New York Times best-selling graphic nonfiction masterpiece depicting the lives of seven New Orleanians before, during, and just after Hurricane Katrina.\r\n\r\nA.D.: New Orleans After the Deluge is a masterful portrait of a city under siege.
