A slim volume, but full of insights and surprises.\r\n\r\nBoth intelligent and accessible, this collection pulls readers into the heart of Turkish culture, politics, and history through multifarious narrative frameworks. The testimonials, memories, and confessions that weave through the pages not only birth a new concept of Turkish life from previously unsung voices, but also tell universal truths about living to which anyone can relate\u2014regardless of background, language, or creed. Providing an enriched experience and taste of modern urban Turkey, these short stories paint Istanbul with many colors, shades, and tones with a luxury that cannot always be afforded by the novel.", "asin": "1905583311", "rank": "2268074", "city": "Istanbul", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GYhzv79nL.jpg", "country": "Turkey", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
