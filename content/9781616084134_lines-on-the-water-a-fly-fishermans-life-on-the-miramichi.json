With the same insight and emotion that have won him praise for his fiction, Richards brings to life a community centred on fly-fishing -- a sport that has become, for many, a way of life. Weaving together tales of the guides and poachers, the \"sports\" and the city slickers, Richards pays tribute to all who have shared in the joy of fishing the Miramichi.\r\n\r\nThis is a book about our relationship with nature, about hunters and fishermen, friendship and family, history and memory. Lines on the Water teems with lore and wisdom, humour, and most of all, passion.", "asin": "1616084138", "rank": "3335322", "city": "New Brunswick", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41OhuTF7a6L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
