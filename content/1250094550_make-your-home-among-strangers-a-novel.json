She struggles in her new \u201cpredominantly white\u201d environment, both academically and socially. She must decide whether she wants to join the upper echelon of college-degree-earning Latinos or get stuck in her old life with her sister, one-year-old nephew, and recently divorced mother. While the novel is technically fiction, I couldn\u2019t help but read it as an autobiography of the author Jennine Capo Crucet. There are some scenes that come off as too real (and sometimes too benign) to be made up. Many scenes are overly descriptive, such as Lizet\u2019s traveling between her college and home, so that the emotional and symbolic narrative gets lost in the noise. Most of the time the story feels long, unwieldy, and a slog to get through. However, there are gems among the rough as Lizet\u2019s struggles to settle in both her old and new life make her an endearing protagonist. It\u2019s easy to sympathize with her yearning to been seen as both a normal college student and someone who understands a Cuban immigrants struggle. Readers who want to learn about the struggle of Latino identity in America, or who can connect to it personally, may find Make Your Home Among Strangers a worthwhile read if they can forgive the slow pace and often overwritten narrative."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "A lot of words that go.... nowhere.

Just weeks before she's set to start school, her parents divorce and her father sells her childhood home, leaving Lizet, her mother, and Leidy-Lizet's older sister, a brand-new single mom-without a steady income and scrambling for a place to live.\r\n\r\nAmidst this turmoil, Lizet begins her first semester at Rawlings College, distracted by both the exciting and difficult moments of freshman year. But the privileged world of the campus feels utterly foreign, as does her new awareness of herself as a minority. Struggling both socially and academically, she returns to Miami for a surprise Thanksgiving visit, only to be overshadowed by the arrival of Ariel Hernandez, a young boy whose mother died fleeing with him from Cuba on a raft. The ensuing immigration battle puts Miami in a glaring spotlight, captivating the nation and entangling Lizet's entire family, especially her mother.\r\n\r\nPulled between life at college and the needs of those she loves, Lizet is faced with difficult decisions that will change her life forever. Urgent and mordantly funny, Make Your Home Among Strangers tells the moving story of a young woman torn between generational, cultural, and political forces; it's the new story of what it means to be American today.", "asin": "1250094550", "rank": "78644", "city": "Miami", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51e4a2wCM4L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
