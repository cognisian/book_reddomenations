This is a gripping, fascinating tale, wonderfully told. It\u2019s more than just a boys' adventure story, as some reviews suggest. It\u2019s moving, funny, and exhilarating. This is nonfiction as it should be written. It\u2019s an escape story full of great characters, each one painted as a real person, set against a dramatic background of super-interesting history. Of course, there's Chan Chak, the one-legged admiral. But there\u2019s also the American woman journalist who keeps a pet gibbon and smokes cigars and opium. There\u2019s the former cavalry officer who tried to shoot a cobra and missed, bringing down a local\u2019s hut instead. There\u2019s \u201cTwo-Gun Cohen,\u201d son of a Polish Jew who was born in London, moved to Canada, became a general in the Chinese Army, and then moved on to arms-dealing, and poker-playing, while wearing a trademark white suit. These characters are made for a big Hollywood blockbuster. George Clooney, buy the rights to this immediately! It has all the makings of a fantastic, old-school buddy movie."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "It was a very interesting book. Good to hear exactly what happened to my father John Jacob Forster, in his last hours.

This group jumped ship at Apleichau, was rescued by five torpedo motor boats, and made its way to Mirs Bay up near the China border. From there, Chinese guerillas--who worshipped one-legged Admiral Chan Chak--helped the group move past Japanese-occupied China into Free China. Most of the British Navy group eventually made it to Burma, thousands of miles from southern China. Tim Luard writes in such a way that the book seems less than a history text and more like a spy thriller.

They travelled on five small motor torpedo boats \u2013 all that remained of the Royal Navy in Hong Kong \u2013 across Mirs Bay, landing at a beach near Nan\u2019ao. Then, guided by guerrillas and villagers, they walked for four days through enemy lines to Huizhou, before flying to Chongqingor travelling by land to Burma.\r\n\r\nThe breakout laid the foundations of an escape trail jointly used by the British Army Aid Group and the East River Column for the rest of the war. Chan Chak, the celebrated \u2018one-legged admiral\u2019, became Mayor of Canton after the war and was knighted by the British for his services to the Allied cause. His comrade in the escape, David MacDougall, became head of the civil administration of Hong Kong in 1945.\r\n\r\nThis gripping account of the escape draws on a wealth of primary sources in both English and Chinese and sheds new light on the role played by the Chinese in the defence of Hong Kong, on the diplomacy behind the escape, and on the guerillas who carried the Admiral in a sedan chair as they led his party over the rivers and mountains of enemy-occupied China.\r\n\r\nEscape from Hong Kong will appeal not just to military and other historians and those with a special interest in Hong Kong and China but also to anyone who appreciates a good old-fashioned adventure story.\r\n\r\nTim Luard is a former Beijing correspondent for the BBC World Service.", "asin": "9888083767", "rank": "3579900", "city": "", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GioCOR4xL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
