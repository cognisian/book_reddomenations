Fascinating, honest, at times titillating and at times disgusting. Having had the WASP experience I found the exploration of being Jewish confusing and interesting. I think most of what he deals with is not limited to anything to do with a Jewish upbringing, perhaps more about being male or American male, than any religious or even ethnic. He does poignantly describe the anxieties of negotiating life's seemingly contrary motivations. This book will rattle in my head for some time to come!"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "An embarrassment to anyone with a Jewish background.

[after Alexander Portnoy (1933- )] A disorder in which strongly-felt ethical and altruistic impulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual longings, often of a perverse nature. Spielvogel says: 'Acts of exhibitionism, voyeurism, fetishism, auto-eroticism and oral coitus are plentiful; as a consequence of the patient's \"morality,\" however, neither fantasy nor act issues in genuine sexual gratification, but rather in overriding feelings of shame and the dread of retribution, particularly in the form of castration.' (Spielvogel, O. \"The Puzzled Penis,\" Internationale Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Psychoanalyse, Vol. XXIV, p. 909.) It is believed by Spielvogel that many of the symptoms can be traced to the bonds obtaining in the mother-child relationship.\r\n\r\nWith a new Afterword by the author for the 25th Anniversary edition.\r\n\r\n\"Touching as well as hilariously lewd....
