Is it true that in the Arctic a drowned body will never come to the surface because there is no microbial activity to release oxygen to make the body float?  Is it true that there is an intestinal worm related to the guinea worm that lives only in sea mammals? Is it true that the ice from congealed fog is more dangerous to a ship than the ice from snow or rain?  Here is a whole universe of knowledge which comes handed to the reader on a platter, the understanding of which becomes the difference between death and survival.Smilla, of course, being half Inuit and half Danish polymath, understands this universe.  In fact, she understands it much better than she understands the world of Western civilization represented in this book by metallurgy, medical research, and money.  She is drawn into this world by another element she barely understands \u2013 love.  She has learned to love a child, and the child is dead.  Was it an accident?  Because of what Smilla knows about the boy, and about snow, she is pretty sure it was not.Smilla\u2019s  exploration into what really happened leads her to danger, anger, passion, revenge, greed, torture, several icy plunges into freezing water, and lots of explanations about ice.  This is a good book to read next to a crackling fire with a cozy afghan around your knees.  Not so good if you are on a cruise to Greenland.As I was thawing out mentally from the vast empty ice floes of northern Greenland where the novel played out its last pages, I began to see a few areas in the plot where Hoeg was skating on pretty thin ice.  But while I was reading, they didn\u2019t show, and even after, they didn\u2019t matter much.  Smilla\u2019s cold universe was amazingly real, whether it was true or not."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I donated this book to Goodwill as soon as I read it because this novel is just trash.
