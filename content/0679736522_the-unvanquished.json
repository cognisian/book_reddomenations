By chance discovering a trusted web page that advised a suggested starting point for a guide to his novels, I grabbed a copy of this amazing canon and was immediately astounded by not only the approachability of the work (it is said that this is Faulkner\u2019s most \u201creadable\u201d novel) but his amazing talent for transitioning from the hard-edged, late Civil War, indigenous Mississippi language to a more deep, nuanced and insightful observation, all seemingly in a single paragraph. I literally had to catch myself in my early reading to not miss a single sublime paragraph or exalted summary... indeed I found Faulkner exceedingly adroit at combining the two.The story revolves around the very late stages of the Civil War, beginning just prior to Union General William Tecumseh Sherman\u2019s scorching march throughout the South. Bayard Sartoris, the fifteen year old son of local Confederate regiment leader John Sartoris and John\u2019s fifteen year old slave Ringo make up the main protagonists here, with the book\u2019s POV being strictly that of Bayard. We discover the two boys as they grow from innocent plantation denizens, wary of the \u201cwar\u201d but completely devoid of its circumstances or meaning, into men, suffering tragedy and personal loss at a young age.Always connected, as if on a spiritual level, even as Bayard goes off to college, the two provide the vehicle for Faulkner to describe the harrowing environment facing the victims of Sherman\u2019s wrath. And as they grow, it is Bayard who recognizes in Ringo, a natural intelligence and forlorn motivation for justice.This relationship becomes important for reasons that become apparent at the end of the book. Faulkner eloquently ties together all the disparate ends of this rather complex tome and does so with an amazing grace and literary fortitude that certainly solidifies his reputation. His writing here is said to lead to the more complex \u201cstream of consciousness\u201d style that he is famous for in works like \u201cAbsalom! Absalom!\u201d and \u201cThe Sound and the Fury\u201d but to me it is just amazingly literary:\u201cWhat counted was, what one of us had done or seen that the otherhad not, and ever since that Christmas I had been ahead of Ringobecause I had seen a railroad, a locomotive. Only I know now that itwas more than that with Ringo, though neither of us was to see theproof of my belief for some time yet and we were not to recognise itas such even then. It was as if Ringo felt it too and that the railroad,the rushing locomotive which he hoped to see symbolised it \u2013 themotion, the impulse to move which had already seethed to a headamong his people, darker than themselves, reasonless, followingand seeking a delusion, a dream, a bright shape which they couldnot know since there was nothing in their heritage, nothing in thememory even of the old men to tell the others, \u2018This is what we willfind\u2019; he nor they could not have known what it was yet it was there \u2013one of those impulses inexplicable yet invincible which appear amongraces of people at intervals and drive them to pick up and leave allsecurity and familiarity of earth and home and start out, they don\u2019tknow where, empty handed, blind to everything but a hope and a doom.\u201dYes, admittedly, I\u2019ve not read a lot of him but, already, the one characterization that I cannot stand is that Faulkner has been forever catalogued as a \u201csouthern\u201d novelist. Another of my favorite authors is Richard Price who writes about crime and murder in NYC\u2026this certainly isn\u2019t to suggest that Price is a novelist in Faulkner\u2019s class but the characterizations are pertinent. Price is considered a \u201ccrime/thriller\u201d writer, not a \u201cNYC writer\u201d or \u201cNorthern writer\u201d so it really bugs me that virtually all Faulkner descriptions start out with him having \u201cthe Great Southern Writer\u201d sobriquet tagged to him. I know, I know\u2026Grisham gets the same treatment and Graham Greene is considered a great \u201cEnglish novelist\u201d but these appellations only hide what they really are, and in the case of Faulkner he is in extremis, and that is great literary novelists. I\u2019m certainly looking forward to discovering more of the Faulkner genius as I move through his works."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The Unvanquished is essentially a compilation of stories Faulkner wrote to solve a cash-flow problem during the writing of Absalom, Absalom! The concluding chapter, \"An Odor of Verbena,\" the only story not sold to a magazine and published before the novel's publication, is the finest of the otherwise solid collection and the only one of the seven written wholly in the mature, fully-formed Faulknerian voice and style. These are fine stories all, narrated in chronological order by Bayard Sartoris, scion of \"The Sartoris,\" John, a Confederate Colonel known by Union invaders as a fearsome battlefield foe but a symbol of the old slaveholding South making its way into an uncharted future prepared for by  \"the Lost Cause\" and its train of consequences. But \"An Odor of Verbena\" attains a magnificence its companion stories fall short of - essentially a \"testing of manhood\" story of now 24-year-old law student Bayard and his response to the fatal shooting of his father and the almost Balkan code of revenge his society expects Bayard to extract. (This is Bayard's second \"test of Southern manhood,\" the first coming in his desire to avenge the wartime murder of his grandmother.) As a tale, this final chapter has everything: the juxaposition of order and change, old and new, memory and the present, codes for men as well as for women, elements of moral and sexual tension,  and of Bayard's arc-of-becoming following his father's death: \"my chance to find out if I am what I think I am or if I just hope; if I am going to do what I have taught myself is right or if I am just going to wish I were.'\"I particularly enjoyed The Unvanquished's two dominant women, Rosa Millard, or \"Granny,\" and Druzilla (\"Dru\") Hawk (later, Sartoris), which shows Faulkner a master of writing and characterizing complex, compelling women - a talent that has often evaded otherwise strong storytellers. granny and Dru's respective stories dominate the front and back halves of  the novel.In short, The Unvanquished is a powerful  reflection of William Faulkner on the Civil War and its consequences and the pressures the ensuing decade of Reconstruction exerted on the men and women of his Yoknapatawpha County."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "you can't beat faulkner.  the phrases inform your days forever.  I bought this again since chapter 6 has a haunting scene of the men coming back from the Civil War understanding that they have lost, and why...and the women who have held fast while they ate pigweed and peanuts through all those years refusing to accept it.  This must have been a big part of the end of the Civil War in the South, but Faulkner's the only writer I've ever seen to write about it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great book...great product which was in great shape!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Good cd.

If it feels like the beginning is slow or uninteresting, keep reading! No chapter is boring, but there's a huge plot twist in the middle that changes everything.
