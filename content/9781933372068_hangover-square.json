Priestley in Penguin Modern Classics.\r\n\r\nLondon, 1939, and in the grimy publands of Earls Court, George Harvey Bone is pursuing a helpless infatuation. Netta is cool, contemptuous and hopelessly desirable to George. George is adrift in a drunken hell, except in his 'dead' moments, when something goes click in his head and he realizes, without a doubt, that he must kill her.\r\n\r\nIn the darkly comic Hangover Square Patrick Hamilton brilliantly evokes a seedy, fog-bound world of saloon bars, lodging houses and boozing philosophers, immortalising the slang and conversational tone of a whole generation and capturing the premonitions of doom that pervaded London life in the months before the war.\r\n\r\nPatrick Hamilton (1904-1962) was one of the most gifted and admired writers of his generation.", "asin": "1933372060", "rank": "1246254", "city": "London", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kQa%2BeKteL.jpg", "country": "England", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
