It was so promising!! I expected so much more with regards to the girls seeking asylum in France and the main character's relationship with these girls. That\u2019s what I was really looking forward to.Then the story line about the main character's brother takes over.You get the impression that this is a case of two short stories that have been linked and that the author intended the immigrant story to be the main one but maybe changed her mind along the way, so that the story about her brother takes precedence. I was disappointed.But it's not a bad story.3.5 stars for this one."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "A story of an American women in Paris, a teacher of poetry, who tries to use it help save girls from other countries trying to gain citizenship. The story also includes a love interest, a family illness, and a trip to India for research to write a book.This story had good potential, but I do not feel that the main three parts of the story blended very well. First she's helping the girls for a large portion at the beginning of the book, which then ends suddenly. Then her trip to India comes and goes quickly, along with a miscarriage that is over and moved past before you knew it started, without any mention of it again. I also understand the connection of her and her father's love for maps by having a lot of streets names throughout the story, but it got tiring reading every street she turned down anytime she went anywhere. It became too much.I do like that it came full circle in the end, but feel this book would have been much better if it was blended a little more, and some things just left out."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I feared this might be to oriented to female writers, but not so.
