It continues in this book.  Inner thoughts and motivations told from the narrator's perspective makes up the style here.  All standard James.  But this story could be used as a means to annoy anyone who is even remotely feminist.  It would work to test the patience and tolerance of most everyone I know.  I won't do a spoiler here but the conclusion is unnecessarily dismal.  However, if you want to improve your vocabulary read this book with a dictionary handy.

One of the speakers is Verena Tarrant, and although he disapproves of all she claims to stand for, Basil is immediately captivated by her and sets about \u2018reforming\u2019 her with his traditional views. But Olive has already made Verena her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, and soon a battle is under way for exclusive possession of her heart and mind. The Bostonians is one of James\u2019s most provocative and astute portrayals of a world caught between old values and the lure of progress.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs devastating in its wit as it is sharp in its social critique of sexual politics.
