He does nothing to alleviate that discomfort except \"finish up quickly\", unless he is explicitly asked by some of the more confident women.  Brown, as shown in the book, clearly views the transaction as buying access to a woman's body, and does not feel he has any responsibility to make paid-for sex a mutually pleasant activity.  This is creepy and gross.Even creepier and grosser is his behavior with a woman, Angelina, who is visibly uncomfortable being chosen, and does not respond at all physically to sex.  Brown returns for a second session, finds that she is still unresponsive and does not speak English.  Later, he goes looking for her again, but can't find her.  This is a huge failure of empathy, as detailed above, but it also raises huge red flags about sex trafficking.At the end of the book, after the comic, Brown offers an extremely weak defense of his pursuit of Angelina:  He is pretty sure she was not a sex slave, because it's not very likely, and if he, Brown, were running a sex slave brothel, he would do it differently. It totally didn't seem like a sex slave brothel!  Creepy and gross.This book is skeevy garbage, and I have no respect for the author as a cartoonist or a fellow human."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Pretty interesting book.

It feel very genuine and autobiographical. It is just the story of someone's experience with prostitution.

This was an exception.  Brown desperately needed more editing here.  The stories become repetitive and he fails to understand that him having sex with people just isn't that interesting to anyone else.I think that was supposed to be a huge part of the book - \"OMG, a john talks!\" - and maybe that would have been a big deal in the 1950s.  But is there any aspect of human sexuality that does not have dozens of first-person stories by now?  Prostitution on both sides isn't exactly a new topic.His polemics are not really suited for the comic book genre - panels that are 75% word balloons.  And then suddenly the story stops with several additional pages of pure text defending his relationship with his current prostitute and trying to make it sound like she's really a girlfriend, even though he pays her to have sex with him.The initial few chapters are interesting as he breaks up with his girlfriend, though it's one of those \"everyone in the universe reading this knows you should leave her and you refuse to admit it\" situations, and it quickly becomes \"dude, just move on already\".  Then there's the other 90% of the book where he traipses from sexual encounter to sexual encounter, interspersing his passionate defense of paying for sex.It's just not that good a read.  Just because you're willing to talk about a taboo subject or are willing to open up and reveal your internal journal does not mean that it's good comics."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Paying for It by Chester Brown is an autobiographical graphic novel that relates Mr. Brown's sex life from 1996 to 2010, which consists of his using professional female escorts for his heterosexual encounters. He mentions using masturbation to cool his ardor prior to these encounters, but provides no further details. To protect the women he changes their names and doesn't provide locations or identifying features. For those of us not familiar with sex workers or their customers, this is a chance to get a glimpse into the workings of this trade.Brown is dispassionate but clearly happy with his decision to outsource his sexual needs, feeling that sex and girlfriends do not go together well for him. The text alternates visits to various escorts with discussions with his male friends and ex-girlfriends about the advantages of his chosen sexual lifestyle. He is well-read on the politics of sex workers and takes a Libertarian position condemning the present laws restricting or outlawing sex work.The body of the book is preceded by an Introduction by Robert Crumb who calls it Mr. Brown's best work. At the end of the book there are 50 pages of Appendices and Notes that go into much deeper detail than the narrative of the book permitted. I would say that he makes as good an argument for unregulated prostitution as you will find in the popular literature."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great book by a great artist."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The subject of prostitution is so charged with gender-conflict that I was amazed to read a book that approaches the subject with cool compassion rather than -- take your pick -- moral outrage, salacious interest, pity, bitter hatred of women/men, cold calculation and all the rest of it.It is strangely melancholy; it seems searingly honest; it is unsparing in its presentation of the \"john\", the author himself; it offers many insights into the mundane realities of the trade.
