Teju Cole's other writing can be wonderful, so I had high expectations.  The title is great, and I was initially drawn to the portrait of Manhattan at a particular moment in time (early 2000s).  I began reading this book in print, then switched over to kindle for a bit, and finally read the whole thing as audiobook.  Kevin Mambo reads in an engaging, fluid way that captures the variety of accents embedded in this book.As other reviewers have noted, the main character in Open City comes across as self-involved, even arrogant at times.  Not sure if this quality was intended by the author, but that is how it comes across.  At first I wasn't sure if this was a result of the reader's inflections, or the actual writing, but when I looked back at the book in print, I felt that Mambo had indeed represented the character, as written, accurately.Since the main character's narration dominates the book, it's hard not to notice that his assigned occupation -- medical resident -- doesn't fit very credibly with the book's premise of wandering through NYC and Europe. Graduate students in some fields might well have that kind of unstructured time while writing dissertations, and may even need to do it for their research, but it's hard to believe that an active medical resident at a competitive university hospital, far uptown in NYC, would have so much free time to wander the streets of lower Manhattan, aimlessly ride the subway, or depart on sudden stints of personal travel abroad.  I found this detail of the narrator's occupation increasingly distracting over the course of the book, and almost stopped reading because of it.  But I pressed on to the end since the book contained some other qualities that held my interest -- his vivid conversations with an internet / phone shop manager, and the intriguing bits of family history that seem to promise some kind of revelation (which never really materializes).At many points, the book has a surreal dreamlike effect that evokes Kafka's Amerika.  (So, maybe the irreality of the narrator's occupation was intentional?)  But that effect is continually offset by long stretches of random information that too often feel like half-digested internet searches.  That's a pity, because Open City otherwise contains some beautiful lyrical sentences about looking and seeing, about people in cities, about America, especially near the end - a reminder of Cole's other vocation as an art historian."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is the BEST book I've read in a LONG time.  If you love NYC you need this book!  I love New York and now have experienced it in a whole new way.  Following the character around on a walking adventure is wonderful!"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "my god; no tension, no story...equals no glory.  love 'blind spot,' but never imagined this pointless meandering.....and, in general, i live for the meander."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Beautifully written and creative. Part of the plotless books that seem to interest young writers now. A little bit too self absorbed, too many high culture references (we trust that you are a cultivated man with refined tastes, Mr. Cole, but not even Proust name dropped at that frequency). But what talent for a first book! OK, give the man another half star."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of the most remarkable books I've read in some time!  At first, I was drawn in by the beauty of the style-- the gorgeous sentences alone are worth the read--but once you've made it some pages in to Open City, you begin to realize that you are not reading ABOUT a man walking through a city and a moment in culture and history; you ARE that man.  Cole has the astonishing gift of understanding how to write movement through time and space so that it is not merely described but directly experienced.  The book has many other excellent qualities, but it is this intimate understanding of how to manage cognitive cues in language that makes Cole's work and vision so extraordinary."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A non-plot novel that keeps me interested from start to end. For people who love to come across historical facts, this book is full of them and they are mentioned or introduced in a decent flow. I also love how random and small but implicitly meaningful moments can be told in this novel and the fact that they, indeed, are quite relevant to each other if we look at them not as separate stories, but as parts of an underlined theme. The absence of an overarching plot leads me to stay in the moment with each stories, lets me feel the time shifts in the mind of the narrator, and indulges me in the process of the narrator's mind-wandering. Quite a nice experience."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Not my kind of book. Prose is well done but had a hard time getting into the book. I need more dialog and \"purpose\" to the storyline.  Found it somewhat boring. Detail is great but sometime too much detail bogs down a story."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I was expecting something more than what I got out of this book.

until the end can one know that there is no intended listener for julius, that the story stands as a personal undated journal by a man who spends quite a bit of time by himself, when he isn\u2019t working, reading philosophy, essays, histories and european literature, attending non-mainstream movies, symphonic concerts, and art galleries and photography exhibitions by himself.  an aesthete, a

relationship.  julius doesn\u2019t appear to be looking for a relationship or bothered by sexual desire.  he is comfortable as a solitude.  he has friends in manhattan, but not close friends, and no romantic interests.during his walks, his color and african features attract the attention of black immigrants from africa and island countries, seeking camaraderie with him, from which julius maintains distance, while lending an ear to the stories of the immigrants who escaped violence, poverty, and oppression, and their struggle to succeed in the united states.in brussels, which became an

displeasure for western culture, their experiences as immigrants, and tolerance for forms of islamic rule which would raise eyebrows if openly discussed in many western countries, even in this novel\u2019s pre-911 setting.subtle queasiness pervades cole\u2019s text, giving rise to the disturbing suspicion that julius is using his skills as a psychiatrist to cope for the lack of a fuller emotional and social life and avoidance of his own bi-racial history; that his predilection for the arts, juxtaposed against the social violence he encounters within the world through experience, media, and conversation, functions for him in a manner similar to how personal violence functioned for justin bateman in bret easton ellis\u2019  American Psycho.  credit cole\u2019s control of tension for how Open City becomes counter-story to ellis\u2019 novel, both novels exploring existential freedom within the city, questioning who are the free, and by what act of daring their freedom
