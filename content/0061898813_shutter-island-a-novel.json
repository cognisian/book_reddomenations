I lived this book. Yes, I\u2019ve seen the movie, but I only half-watched it ages ago & had forgotten much of it. Either way, my foreknowledge didn\u2019t effect the emotional impact of the story. I highly recommend it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I don\u2019t read a lot, but this is one of those books that I will continue to read, and will forever make time to read whenever I have the chance. I wish I could count the amount of times I have argued over the ending with my friends. I was enticed from the beginning and found myself reading this book whenever I had the chance, even skipping out on a good nights sleep to read a few more chapters. I had seen the movie before I read the book (DiCaprio makes a good Teddy Daniels) but the movie does not do this book justice. This is one of those books that you will want to (not have to, but actually want to) re-read to see if you missed anything. Overall, a simply terrific book. An easy 5 out of 5 stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "As a huge fan of the movie, staring Leonardo Dicaprio, I was so excited to read the book. I didn\u2019t even realize it was a novel, until this past summer when a cousin of mine was reading it on our beach vacation. As soon as I got home, I ordered my copy from Thriftbooks and waited for it to arrive.The book offers vastly more insight into Teddy\u2019s mind and how his brain operates throughout the story. The reader experiences his thought processes more so than the movie can portray. This allows the reader to delve into Teddy\u2019s mind and formulate opinions and theories based on the information given to them. Since I have seen the movie, I was unable to come up with my own theories as to the ending, which did take some of the suspense and thrill out of the experience. This is the main reason why I gave the book a 4 instead of a 5. I love trying to predict the ending of a story, and because I already knew the ending, I was unable to do that. I was able to see all the clues the author leaves the reader though, and that was a completely different experience.Dennis Lehane uses thought-provoking descriptions in his novel that prompts the reader to question their own psychology. For me, I wanted to research more into pysch institutes and methods from the past to see the progression of treatments and theories. It made me realize that one of the most powerful things a book can do is make you want to learn more for the sake of learning for fun. Books can show a person what interests them and prompt them to read and learn more about a certain topic. No one is forcing it upon them, nor making them learn a concept because it\u2019s required. Learning and reading for fun are two concepts that I think the world is losing, but are two things the world desperately needs."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I saw the following evaluation, everybody says this is a good product and receive it after use, I think they said is right, I am very happy.
