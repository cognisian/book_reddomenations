Dybek is a Chicago poet.  That led me to I SAILED WITH MAGELLAN, a series of loosely collected short stories.Chicago is a city of neighborhoods and when Dybek was growing up those neighborhoods were ethnic.  His, Polish.  Through alter ego Perry Katzek, these eleven stories introduce us to damaged war veterans, the neighborhood bar, the neighborhood hoodlums.  Perry\u2019s father, always on the lookout for a bargain, torments his two sons with an annual trek to find the cheapest Christmas tree.  He bargains over every purchase on Maxwell Street.  He stops in the street to retrieve lumber and scarps that he might find useful.Poets who turn their efforts to prose are usually great stylists.  Dybek is no exception; his prose is remarkable, spare yet full.\u201cBreasts\u201d is novella-length short story that gives off a \u201cGoodfellas\u201d vibe, while \u201cBlue Boy\u201d almost has a thread of magical realism.

His prose is often quite poetic and his descriptions of Chicago and its characters are funny, poignant and sometimes sad. As a longtime Chicago resident, I appreciate how well he captures an era that I just missed but that my father sometimes speaks about and which you can find captured in old photos of the city. His writing also sometimes has an ethereal, surreal or dreamlike mystical quality that is somewhat similar at times to some of the work by Michael Ondaatje or Paul Bowles.  I've read everything Dybek has written and look forward to his new work."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Hasn't just taken my beathe away.

In I Sailed With Magellan, Dybek finds characters of irrepressible vitality amidst the stark urban landscapes of Chicago's south side; there, the daily experiences of the neighborhood are transformed in the lush imaginative adventures of his hero, the restless Perry Katzek.\r\n\r\nThere is remarkable music in each of Dybek's intertwined episodes, the rhythm of street life captured in all its emotional depth and unexpected humor: a man takes his young nephew to a string of taverns where the boy sings for his uncle's bourbon; a small-time thug is distracted from making a hit by the mysterious reappearance of several ex-girlfriends; two unemployed youths hatch a scheme to finance their road trip to Mexico by selling orchids stolen from the rich side of town; a young couple's amorous beach adventure is interrupted when an unexpected visitor washes ashore. \r\n\r\nAs these poignant, often funny chapters unfold, Perry grapples toward the exotic possibilities the world offers him, glimpsing them even beneath the at times brutal surface of the inner-city.\r\n\r\nThroughout I Sailed With Magellan, fans of Dybek will find the captivating storytelling, the sharp, spare prose, the brilliant dramatization of resilient, inventive humanity that they have come to expect from him.", "asin": "0312424116", "rank": "347619", "city": "Chicago", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51mq1wKGLVL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
