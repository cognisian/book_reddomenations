This is classic noir fiction, and is doesn't get more noir that Fascist Germany.Gunther is a great character, and the books are reminiscent of the equally strong The Good German by Joseph Kanon. Rumor has it, HBO are looking to make an adaptation.

The historical context is well-wrought and central to the detective plots. All in all, pretty compelling.  That's the good stuff.  On the down side, some of the 'hardboiled' analogies come off as cheesy. More troubling is the unreconstructed sexism and homophobia. Yeah, I know, it's supposed to take place in the 30s and 40s, so realism, blah blah.  But this stuff, esp. the gay-bashing and stereotyping made me wince. The first two in the trilogy are worse on this score than the third.  That said, these novels are unique."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I am glad I came upon a review of this author's work in a recent New Yorker magazine. It is truly excellent Noir as well as interesting historical fiction that does not require an unrealistic suspension of disbelief. The research is evident and the plotting is excellent. It makes me want to return to my own work and and continue my own hybrid of historical fiction and crime Noir."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Kerr is a good story-teller.
