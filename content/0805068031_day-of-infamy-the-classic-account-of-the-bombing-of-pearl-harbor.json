Although mostly focusing on those in the military, it also highlights some individuals.Lord is an excellent writer and the book will be entertaining and enjoyable to everyone except hard core history readers looking for something \"really new\" about Pearl Harbor.  The only (minor) complaint is the photos and illustrations will be difficult to see in ebook format unless you have a very large screen Kindle Fire or something similar.  The text works well and it has an active index if you wish to go back to a specific chapter."}]}, "authors": ["Walter Lord"], "isbn": "0805068031", "longitude": -157.8556764, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "Day of Infamy: The Classic Account of the Bombing of Pearl Harbor", "word_cloud": "good history lesson unexpected attack training radar equipment everyone believe happen excellent description attack easy comprehend good individual short story think provoke extremely well anyone interested entry war great thing write find final quarter mostly acknowledgments index job place context individual experience informative anyone interested write several work popular history sink passenger ship adapt movie content chapter fact tell activity night japanese knew hope win war fleet destroy begin plan torpedo shallow water carrier radio operator change ship miss oscilloscope attack fleet keep radio silence early morning strange submarine see carrier airplane readied unknown submarine attack radar station detect huge flight airplane ground saw many airplane regular morning then saw airplane red ball show drop bomb think drill first then alarm go sailor begin shoot back water pressure fire hose men trap water line ship inoperable gun ammunition sailor use available shoot enemy attacker shoot airplanes rush create traffic jam explosion cause shell attack end rumor japanese soldier invade parachutist land attack telegram warn ultimatum japanese deliver time japanese airplane return carrier ship return many work rearm ship prepare attack chapter attempt rescue men trap ship proclaim martial law preparation expect invasion volunteer service continue japanese invader reflect people fear fire imagined enemy sometimes hit civilian soldier even airplane come land rumor japanese invader continue ask war politician change position country effect destruction airplanes old obsolete unit latest model lose battleship replace aircraft carrier new fight ship production automobile stop factory turn military production food clothing gasoline begin blackout coast protection submarine electricity win war make premier power world empires begin end nation declare independence number military civilian dead le attack write several work popular history sink passenger ship adapt movie page content chapter fact trade paperback tell activity night japanese knew hope win war fleet destroy begin plan torpedo shallow water carrier radio operator change ship miss oscilloscope attack fleet keep radio silence early morning strange submarine see carrier airplane readied unknown submarine attack radar station detect huge flight airplane ground saw many airplane regular morning then saw airplane red ball show drop bomb think drill first then alarm go sailor begin shoot back water pressure fire hose men trap water line ship inoperable gun ammunition sailor use available shoot enemy attacker shoot airplanes rush create traffic jam explosion cause shell attack end rumor japanese soldier invade parachutist land attack telegram warn ultimatum japanese deliver time japanese airplane return carrier ship return many work rearm ship prepare attack chapter attempt rescue men trap ship proclaim martial law preparation expect invasion volunteer service continue japanese invader reflect people fear fire imagined enemy sometimes hit civilian soldier even airplane come land rumor japanese invader continue ask war politician change position country effect destruction airplanes old obsolete unit latest model lose battleship replace aircraft carrier new fight ship production automobile stop factory turn military production food clothing gasoline begin blackout coast protection submarine electricity win war make premier power world empires begin end nation declare independence number military civilian dead le attack light history tell perspective dozen individual side live battle mostly focus military also highlight excellent writer entertain enjoyable everyone hard core history reader look something really new minor complaint photo illustration difficult see book format large screen something similar text work well active index wish back specific chapter", "genres": ["History", "WWII"], "summary": "A special 60th anniversary edition of the bestselling re-creation of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, by the author of A Night to Remember.\r\n\r\nSunday, December 7, 1941, was, as President Roosevelt said, \"a date which will live in infamy.\" Day of Infamy is a fascinating account of that unforgettable day's events. In brilliant detail Walter Lord traces the human drama of the great attack: the spies behind it; the Japanese pilots; the crews on the stricken warships; the men at the airfields and the bases; the Japanese pilot who captured an island single-handedly when he could not get back to his carrier; the generals, the sailors, the housewives, and the children who responded to the attack with anger, numbness, and magnificent courage.\r\n\r\nIn piecing together the saga of Pearl Harbor, Lord traveled over fourteen thousand miles and spoke or corresponded with over five hundred individuals who were there. He obtained exclusive interviews with members of the Japanese attacking force and spent hundreds of hours with the Americans who received the blow -- not just the admirals and generals, but enlisted men and families as well. \r\n\r\nHe visited each of the Hawaiian bases attacked and pored over maps, charts, letters, diaries, official files, newspapers, and some twenty-five thousand pages of testimony, discovering a wealth of information that had never before been revealed. \r\n\r\nDay of Infamy is an inspiring human document and the best account we have of one of the epic events in American history.", "asin": "0805068031", "rank": "163422", "city": "Honolulu", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512tR-8ucFL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
