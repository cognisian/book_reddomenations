Pop songs were written about him. Women whom he had never met offered to leave their husbands for him. He had an eye for feminine beauty, particularly when it came with great wealth: Barbara Hutton, Doris Duke, Eva Per\u00f3n, and Zsa Zsa Gabor. But he was a man's man as well, polo player and race-car driver, chumming around with the likes of Joe Kennedy, Frank Sinatra, Oleg Cassini, Aly Khan, and King Farouk. \r\n\r\nHe was also a jewel thief, and an intimate of one of the world's most bloodthirsty dictators. And when he died at the age of fifty-six\u2014wrapping his sports car around a tree in the Bois de Boulogne\u2014a glamorous era of white dinner jackets at El Morocco and celebrity for its own sake died along with him.\r\n\r\nHe was one of a kind, the last of his breed. And in The Last Playboy, author Shawn Levy brings the giddy, hedonistic, and utterly remarkable story of Porfirio Rubirosa to glorious Technicolor life.", "asin": "B001PO65KO", "rank": "2879959", "city": "Santo Domingo", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21VuEvOL3pL.jpg", "country": "D.R.", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
