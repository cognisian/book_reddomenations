Conversations ranged from the topics of literature, philosophy, history, psychology, memoir-writing, and more, and all proved to be fascinating and quite well-written.

Sometimes that rambling is engaging like a good pub discussion but mostly it's banal & rather frequently unapologetically chauvinist & racist.Knausgaard is the Jonathan Franzen of Europe. His sexism is so casual. I suppose I shouldn't expect less from a writer whose success is predicated on mansplaining 'not all men' over 3600 pages. Ekelund balances this with a fervent distaste or fetishization of any race/religion outside his own. His is the sad bigotry of the Enlightenment white man.All of this made the tiny gems about football too few to warrant the effort.

He is watching soccer on TV and falls asleep in front of the set. He likes 0-0 draws, cigarettes, coffee, and Argentina.\r\n\r\nFredrik Ekelund is away, in Brazil, where he plays soccer on the beach and watches matches with others. Ekelund loves games that end up 4-3 and teams that play beautiful soccer. He likes caipirinhas and Brazil.\r\n\r\nHome and Away is an unusual soccer book, in which the two authors use soccer and the World Cup in Brazil as the arena for reflections on life and death, art and politics, class and literature. What does it mean to be at home in a globalized world?\r\n\r\nThis exchange of letters opens up new vistas and gives us stories from the lives of two creative writers. We get under their skin and gain insight into their relationships with modern times and soccer\u2019s place in their lives, the significance the game has for people in general, and the question Was this the best soccer championship ever?\r\n\r\n\u201cFascinating and complex insights into the way \u2018modern football\u2019 is manufactured and disseminated, the way it reaches into our lives and what we make of it when it\u2019s there. . . . From the rosy glow of remembered childhood televisions\u2014Knausgaard makes a lovely note about the sound, just the sound, of a World Cup game on television on a summer evening\u2014through to the semi-political assemblies of lower league away days, football means something to almost everybody. For all its tribal allegiances, in a world where culture and politics have splintered into ever more segregated niches, there is undoubtedly something non-denominational about football. . . . What this book does is important because it thinks about football as a part of life, not as some specialist endeavour.\u201d The Irish Times\r\n", "asin": "0374279837", "rank": "94493", "city": "Rio de Janeiro", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511jJHoOWNL.jpg", "country": "Malmo", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
