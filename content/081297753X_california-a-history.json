Reading this book has exhausted me and I'm generally a very good reader of what others consider to be dull materials.  Along with the helpful information I feel that the author includes too many irrelevant details and asides about historical figures that he only mentions once.  All in all though it is a nice over view I would prefer a more in-depth analysis of each topic.  I feel like too much is glossed over so nothing really creates much of a lasting impression.  This book has throughly irritated me if I'm being honest."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Kevin Starr is the go-to on anything about California!

Now the Golden State\u2019s premier historian, Kevin Starr, distills the entire sweep of California\u2019s history into one splendid volume. From the age of exploration to the age of Arnold, this is the story of a place at once quintessentially American and utterly unique.\r\n\r\nArguing that America\u2019s most populous state has always been blessed with both spectacular natural beauty and astonishing human diversity, Starr unfolds a rapid-fire epic of discovery, innovation, catastrophe, and triumph.\r\n\r\nFor generations, California\u2019s native peoples basked in the abundance of a climate and topography eminently suited to human habitation. By the time the Spanish arrived in the early sixteenth century, there were scores of autonomous tribes were thriving in the region. Though conquest was rapid, nearly two centuries passed before Spain exerted control over upper California through the chain of missions that stand to this day.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of gold in January 1848 changed everything. With population increasing exponentially as get-rich-quick dreamers converged from all over the world, California reinvented itself overnight. Starr deftly traces the successive waves of innovation and calamity that have broken over the state since then\u2013the incredible wealth of the Big Four railroad tycoons and the devastating San Francisco earthquake of 1906; the emergence of Hollywood as the world\u2019s entertainment capital and of Silicon Valley as the center of high-tech research and development; the heroic irrigation and transportation projects that have altered the face of the region; the role of labor, both organized and migrant, in key industries from agriculture to aerospace.\r\n\r\nKevin Starr has devoted his career to the history of his beloved state, but he has never lost his sense of wonder over California\u2019s sheer abundance and peerless variety. This one-volume distillation of a lifetime\u2019s work gathers together everything that is most important, most fascinating, and most revealing about our greatest state.", "asin": "081297753X", "rank": "51752", "city": "Los Angeles", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41LIWQkxJ8L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
