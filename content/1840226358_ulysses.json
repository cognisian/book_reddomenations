Some of the footnote stars aren't even hyperlinks, just a character added to the end of the sentence, which seems strange for an edition that aims to preserve the original print run's text.

Filled with experimental forms of prose, stream of consciousness, puns, parodies, and allusions that Joyce himself hoped would \u201ckeep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant\u201d. \r\n\r\nThis expansive work is considered one of the great works of English literature and a must read for fans of the modernist genre.
