Archy and his wife, Gwen, are expecting their first baby; Nat and Aviva have a teenaged son, Julius. Cranky, flawed and loving each other with all the fierceness we\u2019ve come to expect of Chabon characters, Archy and Nat have worked to construct lives and livelihoods that have a groove, looking to connect across barriers of race and class, and clinging to a sense of order and security through their stubbornly old-school ways.\r\n\r\nWhen ex-NFL quarterback Gibson Goode, the fourth-richest black man in America, announces plans to construct his latest Dogpile megastore on a nearby neglected stretch of Telegraph Avenue, Nat and Archy fear it means certain doom for their vulnerable little enterprise. What they don\u2019t know is that Goode\u2019s announcement marks the climax of a decades-old secret history encompassing a forgotten crime of the Black Panther era, the tragedy of Archy\u2019s own deadbeat father\u2014a long faded Blaxploitation star\u2014and the perpetual shining failure of American optimism about race.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn amazingly rich, emotionally detailed story\u2026.[Chabon\u2019s] people become so real to us, their problems so palpably netted in the author\u2019s buoyant, expressionistic prose, that the novel gradually becomes a genuinely immersive experience\u2014something increasingly rare in our ADD age.\u201d New York Times", "asin": "006149335X", "rank": "106465", "city": "Oakland", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61013ifm9qL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
