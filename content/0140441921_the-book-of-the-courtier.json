Much of what was in this book was not what I was expecting; kind of like expecting a class to teach about courtroom procedures and how to best use them, but then being told all about how to present oneself in court. Of course, looking good, having a nice voice, being of good breeding, knowing how to dress, maybe play music, and education are helpful, but not in this book when one knows those traits are helpful wherever you go. If this was the book on what went on in the courts, and knowing how the condottiere ran the battlefields, no wonder every nation could invade the Italian peninsula!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a book I would recommend young people to read.This describes how to form your behavior,thoughts and outfit in the world,Even todayThis is suitable for young men"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Disappointingly, this is a reprint of a very old translation into English.

In a lively series of imaginary conversations between the real-life courtiers to the Duke of Urbino, his speakers discuss qualities of noble behaviour \u2013 chiefly discretion, decorum, nonchalance and gracefulness \u2013 as well as wider questions such as the duties of a good government and the true nature of love. \r\n\r\nCastiglione\u2019s narrative power and psychological perception make this guide both an entertaining comedy of manners and a revealing window onto the ideals and preoccupations of the Italian Renaissance at the moment of its greatest splendour.\r\n\r\nGeorge Bull\u2019s elegant translation captures the variety of tone in Castiglione\u2019s speakers, from comic interjections to elevated rhetoric. This edition includes an introduction examining Castiglione\u2019s career in the courts of Urbino and Mantua, a list of the historical characters he portrays and further reading.", "asin": "0140441921", "rank": "356689", "city": "Rome", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GKz0e6CpL.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
