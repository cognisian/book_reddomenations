Many authors try to tackle the subject of losing a loved one, but often focus in on one emotion that arises and block out everything else. Both stories (especially the eponymous tale) do an amazing job of running through all the emotions that can come into one's mind after losing a loved one. If you're going through tough times, this is THE novel I would recommend reading."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A great little airport read.

I\u2019m not talking about wolfing down garlic mashed potatoes from a pan; I\u2019m talking about a multi-course gourmet meal that you are willing to toss out if it\u2019s not perfect and start all over again. That\u2019s the theme of Kitchen. Our main character is a twentyish-woman who lost her father at an early age and then her mother. She went to live with grandparents but her grandfather died, and then her grandmother, and now she has no living relatives.She turns to her kitchen. But she is also invited to live with the family of a young man she has known since childhood. Now here\u2019s a modern family: just two people, the young man and his mother. But did I tell you his father is his mother? Or, to phrase that more correctly, his mother is his father? It\u2019s a transgender situation. The two young people are drawn to each other but then he is hit by loss. They grapple with trying to help each other, maybe love each other, or maybe just pity each other, and try to stop each other from jumping over the edge.This very short novel has a short story appended at the end: Moonlight Shadow. This story, also about loss, and it could be the same woman, takes us into magical realism. Maybe they do come back, at least to tell you they\u2019re ok.I found the two stories very moving and fascinating to read.

As an orphan being raised by her grandmother, the girl finds comfort in the one place where happy memories were made, which is\u00a0the kitchen. After her grandmother passes, Mikage finds herself scooped up by another not so traditional family, but one filled with all the things she needs, which is light and love.Told with courageous honesty, Yoshimoto holds nothing back when it comes to the painfully confusing process of grief. Although the subject is heavy, the author delivers her story with a surprising mix of humor and lightness. The characters are endearing and believable, their conflicts painfully relatable.I enjoyed this story very much and I recommend it for anybody wanting\u00a0to step into the\u00a0Japanese culture.

Mikage, the heroine, is an orphan raised by her grandmother, who has passed away. Grieving, Mikage is taken in by her friend Yoichi and his mother (who is really his cross-dressing father) Eriko. \r\n\r\nAs the three of them form an improvised family that soon weathers its own tragic losses, Yoshimoto spins a lovely, evocative tale with the kitchen and the comforts of home at its heart.\r\n\r\nIn a whimsical style that recalls the early Marguerite Duras, \"Kitchen\" and its companion story, \"Moonlight Shadow,\" are elegant tales whose seeming simplicity is the ruse of a very special writer whose voice echoes in the mind and the soul.\r\n\r\n\u201cMs. Yoshimoto\u2019s writing is lucid, earnest and disarming . . . [It] seizes hold of the reader\u2019s sympathy and refuses to let go.\u201d The New York Times\r\n", "asin": "0802142443", "rank": "44655", "city": "Tokyo", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41UDtUZnfYL.jpg", "country": "Japan", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
