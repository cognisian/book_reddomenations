It follows the lives of the four Mirabal sisters as they come of age in Trujillo\u2019s Dominican Republic up until their lives begin to intertwine with the dictator\u2019s regime against their will. Their journey begins as young women at school, ignorant of Trujillo\u2019s atrocities. As his actions become more obvious and abhorrent, in time with the sisters reaching adulthood, they feel compelled to join the underground rebellion that seeks to overthrow him. The repercussions are swift and brutal as they face retaliation from Trujillo and his military forces. The novel begins with the only surviving sister in the \u201cpresent\u201d day, Dede, as she recounts to the fictional author the details of her life and the historical sacrifice of her sisters: Minerva, Patria, and Maria Teresa. We witness the Dominican Republic as a microcosm, as the Mirabels and islanders live and suffer under the Trujillo regime. Their ideas of faith, family and communal identity are put under enormous pressure in a society simply trying to survive. Who can you trust when anyone, especially your neighbor, can be a SIM spy?Alvarez manages to weave fiction and history together into a tapestry of emotional nuance and authentic martyrdom. The novel is woven together by the separate points of view of the four sisters. Each voice feels remarkably unique and full of personality. Each sister\u2019s writing reads very true-to-self and at no point did I feel that the voices ran together or overlapped. Alvarez nails down each sister\u2019s unique personality, mannerisms, and thought processes so well that the novel genuinely feels as if it\u2019s written by four different people. It gives the story and the history a sense of depth that I have not encountered before.If you find yourself looking for an engaging, emotionally profound historical novel from a time period you likely haven\u2019t encountered much of before, then In the Time of the Butterflies is just for you."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "It\u2019s an interesting book. A fictional account of the true story of the Mirabal sisters in the Dominican Republic."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I rate this book PG 14 for sensual scenes, sexual innuendos, randy humor, and violence.  Raw and realistic, this book left me feeling unsettled and melancholy.  This fictionalized account is insightful and introspective.  Bright lives lost too soon.  Their lights flickered out leaving only darkness.  Told in a series of flashbacks, Alvarez gives the reader a thoughtful perspective and deeper understanding of a painful event in history.  \u201cHer martyrdom is to be alive without them.\u201d"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "great product , excellent shipping  no problems  seller is AAAAAA+++++++  would recommend to others"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is one of the best books.

The official state newspaper reports their deaths as accidental. It does not mention that a fourth sister lives. Nor does it explain that the sisters were among the leading opponents of Gen. Rafael Leonidas Trujillo\u2019s dictatorship. It doesn\u2019t have to. Everybody knows of Las Mariposas\u2015\u201cThe Butterflies.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn this extraordinary novel, the voices of all four sisters\u2015Minerva, Patria, Mar\u00eda Teresa, and the survivor, Ded\u00e9\u2015speak across the decades to tell their own stories, from hair ribbons and secret crushes to gunrunning and prison torture, and to describe the everyday horrors of life under Trujillo\u2019s rule. Through the art and magic of Julia Alvarez\u2019s imagination, the martyred Butterflies live again in this novel of courage and love, and the human cost of political oppression.
