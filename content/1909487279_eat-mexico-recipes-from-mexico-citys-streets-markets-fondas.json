In this book, journalist Lesley T\u00e9llez\u2014who also runs her own food tour company in Mexico City\u2014takes you through the city's most classic dishes, offering recipes from her favorite haunts on the streets, in city markets, and in small, homestyle fondas. \r\n\r\nMany of these dishes are items Americans may not recognize: the football-shaped, bean-stuffed corn tlacoyo, topped with cactus and salsa; the tortas bulging with turkey confit and a peppery herb called p\u00e1palo; beer-braised rabbit, slow-cooked until tender. The book ends on a personal note, highlighting the creative, Mexican-inspired dishes\u2014like roasted poblano oatmeal\u2014that Lesley cooks at home in New York with ingredients she came to know in Mexico.\r\n\r\nWith more than 100 recipes, on-location photography and text written in a friendly, personal tone, Eat Mexico is a must for anyone who loves Mexico, its food and unique urban culture.", "asin": "1909487279", "rank": "57986", "city": "Mexico City", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MmeJkG5ZL.jpg", "country": "Mexico", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
