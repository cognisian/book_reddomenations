A good read."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "A dispiriting and dreary novel without one admirable character. The book\u2019s first half showed promise, but the author then seemed to lose interest and energy. The result is a dwindling, episodic plot without causality, the characters incapable of taking independent action or surprising the reader in any way. Theroux, a fan of Georges Simenon, seems influenced here by the latter\u2019s spare psychological novels, with their claustrophobic settings and weak, haunted protagonists. However, Theroux fails to deliver the tension, insight and humanity of Simenon\u2019s best. This is the fourth Theroux book I\u2019ve read in the last month, albeit the first novel. Enough for now."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Theroux's Pride and Prejudice of HK. Depressing and stereotypical.

This novel on Hong Kong, from the perspective of British people, that earned their livelihood in HK was very interesting.

Great book."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Paul Theroux is a wonderful travel writer; too bad he did not stick to that genre.  Kowloon Tong is a poor book--poorly written, poorly plotted--poor characters.  The stereotyping of English people living in Hong Kong is almost too much to even talk about.  To have lived in Hong Kong for forty years and have the mother character still refer to Chinese as \"Chinky-Chongs\" is patently absurd.  The main character, \"Bund\" (appropriately named) has the fewest amount of will ever devised in a man/son.  His inability to stand up to his mother in anyway makes the characer seem totally unreal.  No one is really like this character.  He is bullied into selling his property (by his mother); he cannot have any relationship at all without worrying about his mother's feelings; he follows her directions/desires/orders without a whimper.  Her response to his losing the woman he supposedly loves, \"They all look alike; you can always find another\" is just ridiculous.  Perhaps I miss the sarcasm, the irony, or whatever high-sounding literary term is that could be applied to this book, but if I had not paid good money for it, I definitely would have chucked it afte the first thirty pages!"}]}, "authors": ["Paul Theroux"], "isbn": "0395901413", "longitude": 114.1628131, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "Kowloon Tong: A Novel of Hong Kong", "word_cloud": "think nail describe well angry widow shambolic son cultural ignorance swim turn wise thoughtful cowardice family story bring back great memory live handover lot predictable sexual innuendo pleasure straight white men asian chick fetish sure author try mockery story poorly put together prove author totally short sight waste time reading want snapshot life colonist splendid somebody grow good dispiriting dreary admirable character first half show promise author seem lose interest energy result dwindle episodic plot causality character incapable take independent action surprising way fan seem influenced latter spare psychological novel claustrophobic setting weak haunted protagonist however fail tension insight humanity best fourth last month first stereotypical try use stereotype mock stereotype bad fail lit class like kind critically know mostly hit great travel perspective british people earn livelihood interesting someone live recognize many observation locations business practice father son joy wonderful travel writer bad stick genre poor poorly write poorly plot poor character stereotype english people live almost much even forty year mother character still refer chinese patently absurd main character appropriately name fewest amount ever devise inability stand mother anyway make character totally unreal one really like character bully sell property mother relationship worry mother feeling follow response lose woman supposedly love look alike always find ridiculous perhaps miss sarcasm irony literary term pay good money definitely first thirty page", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Mystery & Suspense"], "summary": "Ninety-nine years of colonial rule are ending as the British prepare to hand over Hong Kong to China.
