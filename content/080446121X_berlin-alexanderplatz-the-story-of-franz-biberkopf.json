Alfred Doblin's debts to both modernists is deep, as he tells the tale of ex-con Franz Biberkopf in Weimar Germany's central city. But the city does not come alive as vividly as I anticipated, and the protagonist, unlike Leopold Bloom, lacks the broad appeal that Joyce's everyman does. Less erudite than Joyce, less leftist than Dos Passos, Doblin places Bibi in a less politically charged atmosphere. As he's a pimp and thug, it's harder to care about the fate of this conniving man. His suffering leaves the reader more indifferent.For all the potential of a sexy thriller, the plot is not that engaging either. I perked up most when Bibi debated an elderly worker with anarchic sympathies, but this lasted only a few pages and dribbled out. You do see glimpses of others in this Berlin, but the editorial voice (a device I sometimes like a lot) here only tips the reader off to Bibi's fate, and that intervention distances the reader all the more.Some criticize the dated tough-guy pulp-speak of this novel as rendered by Jolas from a purportedly difficult to translate Berlin working-class dialect. I did not mind that tone, for it fit the gangster image of Capones and bootleggers from this same period in America, with a similar slangy, mocking dialogue. But the lack of suspense made the novel enervating. It's readable, sure, but outside of the passages where Doblin's omniscient narrator channels Job, Jeremiah, Revelation, and Genesis in a charged fashion at odds with the earthy characters and settings, it's not that surprising or engrossing."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The book itself is simply amazing and I could not at all improve on the insightful review of Giordano Bruno below (or above) written in 2009. My big HOWEVER is that I think the Eugene Jolas translation from over seventy years ago is simply not very good. Your best bet is to purchase Anne Thompson's new translation which to my mind captures completely the allegedly \"untranslatable\" argot of Berlin lowlifes from the 1920's.It seems to be pretty much an amazon exclusive, available here. Mr. Bruno did not have this translation available at the time he wrote his piece.http://www.amazon.com/Berlin-Alexanderplatz-Alfred-D%C3%B6blin/dp/1494271451/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1430425784&sr;=1-1&keywords;=berlin+alexanderplatzHaving read both (well, honestly, I could only get through half the Jolas work), Ms. Thompson's is definitely worth the extra $$"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "does not appear to be a good translation."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Yes, this is the German Ulysses.  Alfred Doblin really gets inside the heads of his characters, letting us see at least as much of what goes on inside their heads as outside.The point of his novel is best summed up on page 634: \"We know what we know, the price we paid was not low.\""}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a somewhat challenging but very rewarding book. A long book about a character that I started out hating, began to tolerate, but then finally came to have at least some empathy for. It's a book that surprises you. Most of the way, it seems as nihilistic as Franz and his buddies tend to be, but against all odds it ends up with a \"moral\". I see Franz as a parody of the Superman of Nietzsche--who is referenced once in the book. Franz always believes he can exert his will on life--until life and \"death\" exert their wills on him and show him how weak he always was by comparison. He then learns the hard, cocky man is a blind man because he pays no attention to others. To Doblin, it seems that empathy is strength while egotistic will is for cowards and frauds--like the \"self made man\" from Albania described by the Jews at the beginning. It's also a book which seems to celebrate the redemptive, cleansing power of guilt. The expression \"guilt is a useless emotion\" has no place here. Franz is only saved after his subconscious mind forces him to accept the pitiless hand of personal responsibility and the crushing guilt it can bring.It should be added that with all the poverty, death, and despair in this book, it can be wickedly funny. Doblin has a terrific wacky absurdist, self-referential sense of humor in this book that is pretty great.It's also amazing to read about \"swastika men\" in a book published in 1929 and prophetic predilections of the collapse of Germany through additional warfare."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A true masterpiece of the Weimar era. Doblib's Berlin Alexanderplatz is a profoundly charged-allegorical representation of a nation undergoing pathological convulsions. It is the story of Franz Biberkopf, a man who has been released from jail (for manslaughter) and who is determined to live a moral life. But Franz will quickly find out that such a life is no longer possible in a world where gangsters and fascist hoodlums control everything, a world where the only sense of recognition available is through moral bondage. D\u00f6blin's prose is constantly in flux--by turns, the perspective of Berlin Alexanderplatz shifts from the voice of narrative omniscience, to internal (almost stream-of-consciousness) narration, and freely inserts itself into the consciousness of sustaining characters. Through the combination of rapidly alternating registers and perspectives, D\u00f6blin's prose is able to modulate between the descriptive, the allegorical, as well as the surreal. While officially classified as a work of \"expressionism,\" Berlin Alexanderplatz is nevertheless a remarkably prescient representation of the historical rise of National Socialism. An astonishing masterpiece-one of the major works of the century, beyond any doubt."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Hace alg\u00fan tiempo que le\u00ed la novela y recuerdo que fue un placer hacerlo.
