Although he is best known for In Cold Blood, I prefer these earlier stories.  Breakfast at Tiffany's  was a good movie but the original story by Truman Capote is captivating in another way, delving into a broader range of characters and life in the New York of the late 50s.Also notable in this collection is A Christmas Memory, one of my favorite Christmas stories. It is beautifully written about interesting people.  Capote at his best."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Meh.

Poetry as prose. Three separate stories.

I purchased the audio version of this book because I\u2019m a fan of borh Mr. Hall and Capote.  I\u2019ve seen the movie as well as having read the book (MANY years ago).  However, hearing the book read was a bit of a revelation.  The movie was somewhat different because back in the 60s, when it was made \u201crequired\u201d several changes according to studio heads.  All of the gay references were removed.  If I\u2019m not mistaken, Paul was even gay in the book. In any event, the time period in which the book is set is the 40s so the reader  is.saddled with some racial perjoratives.  Small criticism since those were quite \u201cappropriate\u201d for the time period.  As indicated above, I was most impressed with MCH\u2019s narration.  The voices he used for different characters were excellent.  I honestly thought they had a female narrating Holly\u2019s voice for about the first quarter of the book.  Is there anything MCH can\u2019t do?  I won\u2019t explain here why I gave it four stars instead of five as that might be considered a spoiler.Recommended."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I didn\u2019t even realize the book even ended and continued to read the next short story thinking it had some connection and of course it didn\u2019t. Disappointing. Had to google some descriptions in the book from the lighting of a cigarette part lol that was the first time hearing this \u201csaying\u201d why are there such good reviews on this??"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "In rereading this book it makes me sad to realize he\u2019s gone and no longer producing quiet masterpieces like this."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "With the possible exception of the Herbert Clutter family of IN COLD BLOOD, Miss Holiday Golightly, \"Traveling,\" has to be Truman Capote's best-known figure.  Those who have seen the movie with Audrey Hepburn may be surprised to read Capote's World War II-set novella and learn that \"Holly\" was more of a demimondaine -- and a bit of a racist -- compared to the beguiling movie.  Still, it's captivating reading.  Perhaps better yet, this volume includes Capote's etheral first novel, OTHER VOICES OTHER ROOMS, written in a style of literary symbolism that captures so well the changes a young orphan goes through when he leaves home, connects with distant relatives in a distant location, and realizes his sexuality.  These two stories are so rich and enjoyable that a hardcover is really the way to go for repeat readings."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Breakfast at Tiffany's -  Maybe I'm spoiled by the movie, or maybe I just don't like Capote? Either way I wasn't overly charmed with the book. Truly, I prefer protagonists I like, and Holly isn't terribly likeable...  It's a classic, probably deservedly so, but it's not my cup of tea. 2 stars.House of Flowers -  I actually really enjoyed this one.  The descriptions, the plot, characters, and just the general flow was lovely to read. I didn't like the last sentence one bit but I can overlook that. 5 starsDiamond Guitar - I have no strong opinion on this story. Nice enough, but quite short. 3 starsA Christmas Memory - 4 stars"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Such a beautifully written story!
