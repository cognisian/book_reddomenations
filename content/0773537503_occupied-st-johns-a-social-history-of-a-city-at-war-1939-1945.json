Alexander docked in St John's Harbour, carrying a thousand American soldiers sent to join the thousands of Canadian troops protecting Newfoundland against attack by Germany. \r\n\r\nFrance had fallen, Great Britain was fighting for its survival, and Newfoundland \u2013 then a dominion of Britain \u2013 was North America\u2019s first line of defence. Although the German invasion never came, St John\u2019s found itself occupied by both Allied Canadian and American forces. \r\n\r\nOccupied St John\u2019s reveals the profound impact that the war years had on the city\u2019s inhabitants, thrown into a conflict where the \u201chome front\u201d was also the \u201cwar front.\u201d Weaving together interviews with residents who lived through the upheaval as well as archival material, this collection reconstructs the memories of people coping with extraordinary circumstances. \r\n\r\nLavishly illustrated and engagingly written, Occupied St John\u2019s is a remarkable look at the effects of the Second World War on the city, opening another chapter in Newfoundland\u2019s fascinating history.\r\n", "asin": "0773537503", "rank": "6540729", "city": "New Brunswick", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51LDPIOqxeL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
