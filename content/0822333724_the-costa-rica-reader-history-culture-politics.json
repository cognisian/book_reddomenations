Steven Palmer and Iv\u00e1n Molina, against those odds, have put the ball in the back of the net with just such a book.THE COSTA RICA READER'S three-part subtitle (`History, Culture, Politics') is honored along the way with an even touch. Everyone with an interest in Costa Rica as more than a tourist destination with great beaches will find between the covers of this recent collection the stuff that builds insight and understanding. This reviewer lived for sixteen years in 'tiquicia', together with its four million 'ticos', 'nicas', and assorted hangers-on. The West Virginia-sized patch of mountainous land with its sought-after beaches (I rarely found time to visit them) continues to maintain its grip on my soul. I wish this 2004 Duke University Press publication had been available about 1988. It would have rendered easier learning the lessons of tiquicia that had to come the hard, honest way.No matter, it's here now. The editors guide us through a nuanced qualification of `Costa Rican exceptionalism', finding in the tico experience--whether lived by the indigenous groups who were not quite so few and compliant as the national mythology suggests in the face of conquest and marginalization or by the 19th century coffee lords with their debt to German mercantilism or the 1980s Nicaraguan refugee whose task it is to decide with which of her divergent constituencies to identify herself--deep continuities with the rest of Latin American experience as well as a dollop of the country's celebrated idiosyncrasies.The seventy-odd pieces are brief, illuminating, and usually excerpted from something larger. Individually and as a collection, they leave the reader wanting more.Which is not unlike Costa Rica itself in the experience of many sojourners there, many of whom will never go back but who at the same time never manage entirely to leave.Read by this reviewer on a recent working week back in the land it so effectively describes, THE COSTA RICA READER would be highly recommended at twice the price."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I love sociology.

Arguing that conceptions of Costa Rica as a happy anomaly downplay its rich heritage and diverse population, The Costa Rica Reader brings together texts and artwork that reveal the complexity of the country\u2019s past and present. It characterizes Costa Rica as a site of alternatives and possibilities that undermine stereotypes about the region\u2019s history and challenge the idea that current dilemmas facing Latin America are inevitable or insoluble.\r\n\r\nThis essential introduction to Costa Rica includes more than fifty texts related to the country\u2019s history, culture, politics, and natural environment. Most of these newspaper accounts, histories, petitions, memoirs, poems, and essays are written by Costa Ricans. Many appear here in English for the first time. The authors are men and women, young and old, scholars, farmers, workers, and activists. The Costa Rica Reader presents a panoply of voices: eloquent working-class raconteurs from San Jos\u00e9\u2019s poorest barrios, English-speaking Afro-Antilleans of the Lim\u00f3n province, Nicaraguan immigrants, factory workers, dissident members of the intelligentsia, and indigenous people struggling to preserve their culture. \r\n\r\nWith more than forty images, the collection showcases sculptures, photographs, maps, cartoons, and fliers. From the time before the arrival of the Spanish, through the rise of the coffee plantations and the Civil War of 1948, up to participation in today\u2019s globalized world, Costa Rica\u2019s remarkable history comes alive. The Costa Rica Reader is a necessary resource for scholars, students, and travelers alike.", "asin": "0822333724", "rank": "75150", "city": "Costa Rica", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41xawA4QcVL.jpg", "country": "Mexico", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
