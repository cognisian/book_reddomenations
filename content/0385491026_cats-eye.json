Atwood uses different colors to describe the world of artist Elaine Risley. And the use of flashbacks was very effective in telling the story. The main conflict of the novel deals with the reconciliation of Elaine with Cordelia, her childhood tormentor. There is an Elaine and also a Cordelia in all of us, always fighting for domination. Elaine could also be Atwood's alter ego, since their childhood events sometimes coincide. I enjoyed this book very much (though it could've been shorter) and would recommend it to any man and woman"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Loved the book"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of my favorite books ever!
