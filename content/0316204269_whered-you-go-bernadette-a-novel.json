They are used as voice vehicles; this effect is heightened by the mixed media writing (not a written story, rather a series of emails, faxes, reports, etc.). Author uses every cliche, smart-a** retort, and sly innuendo in her arsenal. It's never resolved why Bernadette goes from genius with a bright future, to an internet-shopping shrew and abysmal community member. (Enough with the vest talk, already!) You mean to tell me she never got a flash of brilliance in 20 years!? Until looking out on icebergs in Antarctica. The biggest disappointment was that failure to grow Bernadette as a person in a sincere way. Bee -daughter- was so spoiled as to be spank-worthy.

To her Microsoft-guru husband, she's a fearlessly opinionated partner; to fellow private-school mothers in Seattle, she's a disgrace; to design mavens, she's a revolutionary architect, and to 15-year-old Bee, she is a best friend and, simply, Mom.\r\n\r\nThen Bernadette disappears. It began when Bee aced her report card and claimed her promised reward: a family trip to Antarctica. But Bernadette's intensifying allergy to Seattle--and people in general--has made her so agoraphobic that a virtual assistant in India now runs her most basic errands. A trip to the end of the earth is problematic.\r\n\r\nTo find her mother, Bee compiles email messages, official documents, secret correspondence--creating a compulsively readable and touching novel about misplaced genius and a mother and daughter's role in an absurd world.\r\n\r\n\"Comedy heaven.... This divinely funny, many-faceted novel...leaves convention behind. Instead, it plays to Ms. Semple's strengths as someone who can practice ventriloquism in many voices, skip over the mundane and utterly refute the notion that mixed-media fiction is bloggy, slack or lazy.... The tightly constructed WHERE'D YOU GO, BERNADETTE is written in many formats-e-mails, letters, F.B.I. documents, correspondence with a psychiatrist and even an emergency-room bill for a run-in between Bernadette and Audrey. Yet these pieces are strung together so wittily that Ms. Semple's storytelling is always front and center, in sharp focus. You could stop and pay attention to how apt each new format is, how rarely she repeats herself and how imaginatively she unveils every bit of information. But you would have to stop laughing first.\" The New York Times", "asin": "0316204269", "rank": "3724", "city": "Seattle", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sn0hyI7pL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
