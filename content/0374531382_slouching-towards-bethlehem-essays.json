She lives with her mother and some other people, just got over the measles, wants a bicycle for Christmas, and particularly likes Coca-cola, ice cream, Marty in the Jefferson Airplane, Bob in the Grateful Dead, and the beach. She remembers going to the beach once a long time ago, and wishes she had taken a bucket. For a year now her mother has given her both acid and peyote. Susan describes it as getting stoned.\u201dEssays \u201cOn Self-Respect\u201d and \u201cOn Morality\u201d are two of my favorite pieces in the collection, not because they are better composed than the others (they are not), but because Didion takes subjects that are nebulous and fluid, and she makes them concrete and visceral. Written in 1965, one cannot help but connect \u201cOn Morality\u201d to the Vietnam war, yet reading it today gives one pause for every moralistic crusade we\u2019ve embarked upon, whether it be personal, or national.
