Darwin, the quintessential observer & collector of all things natural, writes in an easy-to-read, travelogue style, while at the same time casting a dispassionate eye on the planet's geology, flora & fauna. Also, I especially enjoyed the book because many years ago I acquired a very nice original oil painting of the Beagle plying its way through the Straight of Magellan, a work which has given me much pleasure over the years."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Would love to recreate this voyage.

His journal reveals him to be a naturalist making patient observations concerning geology and natural history as well as people, places, and events. \r\n\r\nHe witnessed and visited volcanoes in the Galapagos, saw the Gossamer spider of Patagonia, sailed through the Australasian coral reefs, and recorded the brilliance of the firefly--these recollections are found in these extraordinary writings. The insights made on the five-year voyage set in motion the intellectual currents that led to the most controversial book of the Victorian age: On the Origin of Species. \r\n\r\n", "asin": "1544938934", "rank": "5975774", "city": "Gal\u00e1pagos Islands", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31AfivluQEL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
