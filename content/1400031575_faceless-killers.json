And as if this didn\u2019t present enough problems for the Ystad police Inspector Kurt Wallander, the dying woman\u2019s last word is foreign, leaving the police the one tangible clue they have\u2014and in the process, the match that could inflame Sweden\u2019s already smoldering anti-immigrant sentiments.\r\n\r\nUnlike the situation with his ex-wife, his estranged daughter, or the beautiful but married young prosecutor who has peaked his interest, in this case, Wallander finds a problem he can handle. He quickly becomes obsessed with solving the crime before the already tense situation explodes, but soon comes to realize that it will require all his reserves of energy and dedication to solve.", "asin": "1400031575", "rank": "37797", "city": "Stockholm", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41q%2B73djGRL.jpg", "country": "Sweden", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
