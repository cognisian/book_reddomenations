This guy can spin a story. Not my preferred genre, but if I'm going to read murder mysteries, he's my guy. Griping from first page to the last. Just read this book!!!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I\ufe0f just absolutely love Tana French\u2019s writing.  The character development and intricacies of their relationships draw me in every time.  And she can plot twist like no other.  It\u2019s not just about \u201cwho done it\u201d.  I\ufe0f genuinely enjoy the journey to the big reveal and am always left wanting more."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "It was ok.  Hard to get through.

It is very difficult to discuss the good and the bad without spoiling it for other readers.  I will try to keep my review to the main points that influenced my rating the most.So first off I listened to this book as an unabridged Audible book and it clocks in at over 20 hours. The first problem is at about 60% of the way through the book \u2013 it all clicks on the mystery and you realize \u201cAw Hell\u201d there is still like 40% of the book left.  The story basically starts slowing down to almost actual time and it just drags on and on.The characters of Rob, Cassie and Sam have great chemistry and I did like their interactions and the team dynamic throughout the mystery.  Rob and Cassie have a great ease about their relationship that is genuine and built on a strong past. The story is told from Rob\u2019s point of view but I would have liked to hear the other two\u2019s thoughts and observations. Rob as a main character is very intriguing and you are instantly drawn into his world but he is not that likable of guy.I never really got a sense of geography or layout of spaces from the author but I got a great sense of what people look like and their expressions.  The narrator Stephen Crossley did a fine job with the book and really gave a voice to the characters to match the authors great descriptions."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Honestly I found it hard to get into, the main character unlikable, and the big mystery was never answered. Wouldn't recommend."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "As a fan of John sandford books, this book does a great job of holding interest till, and through, the end."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Tangential stories that really don't contribute to the main plot. Because of all the filler, the story took a while to pick up. Decent read but not an all time great."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Quite readable though writing style was not the best, held the mystery till the end.
