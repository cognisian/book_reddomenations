Hard to believe that Charlotte Bronte wrote this and Shirley after she wrote the immortal Jane Eyre.  She should have quit while she was ahead."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This is a hugely accomplished book in many respects. The characterization is strong and varied, the psychological insight is fine, and the prose masterly. Charlotte Bront\u00eb achieves the impressive feat of creating a proto-feminist work from the unpromising material of a very unassuming and passive heroine and sustaining interest in her throughout a long novel. So why only three stars? The plot, such as it is, proceeds through a whole series of highly improbable coincidences. Even by the standards of the 19th century novel, these are so consistent a narrative device as to become unpardonable. Disbelief simply cannot be suspended so frequently and to such an extent. This is a pity as Villette could otherwise have been the masterpiece it is sometimes proclaimed to be, but sadly is not. Less importantly, the book is marred by Bront\u00e9's childish French nomenclature. Naming the country in which the action takes place 'Labassecour' (French for 'farmyard') might, for example, have been witty in a comic work but is simply discordant in a work as solemn and serious as Villette.  It is also revealing of the cultural chauvinism that is at least semi-explicit throughout the work. Would I recommend that Villette be read? Yes, because its good points are so very good. Is it better than Jane Eyre? Much better and far worse."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I ordered this edition because it was the least expensive, and when it arrived I was taken aback. Although it was not damaged, it was not what I was expecting. The book is roughly the size of a magazine, and is printed with very small text. The standard printing of this novel is just over 500 pages, but this edition is only 207 pages, managed by the minuscule text and massive page size.The outside is aesthetically pleasing but this edition is not meant to be read."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "This read as two books out together to make one.  Also, the book takes a sharp turn at the end, and it is as though the author tired of the story and decided to being the book to an abrupt end."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Classic story"}]}, "authors": ["Charlotte Bront\u00eb"], "isbn": "0140434798", "longitude": 4.351697, "periods": ["1800s"], "title": "Villette", "word_cloud": "find overly long subjected profusion unrealistic improbability course passage brilliant write whole enjoy spite critic consensus superior enjoy character way character strong unending challenge life love edition much buy several bind problem cat also like bind little string mark page day chew corner paperback realize order paper workbook school think hard cover enjoy immensely author affinity detail word adequately express suspense enjoy start sympathetic heroine religious prejudice display also long stretch untranslated french forget much high school believe write write immortal quit ahead hugely accomplished many respect characterization strong varied psychological insight fine prose masterly achieve impressive feat create work unpromising material unassuming passive heroine sustain interest long star plot proceeds whole series highly improbable coincidence even standard century consistent narrative device become unpardonable simply suspend frequently extent pity masterpiece sometimes proclaim sadly importantly mar childish french nomenclature country action take place french example comic work simply discordant work solemn serious also reveal cultural chauvinism least work recommend good point good better better far worse order edition least expensive arrive take aback damage expect roughly size magazine print small standard printing page edition page manage minuscule text massive page aesthetically please edition meant together make also take sharp turn end author tire story decide abrupt end classic story", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature"], "summary": "\"I am only just returned to a sense of real wonder about me, for I have been reading Villette...\" George Eliot\r\n\r\nWith neither friends nor family, Lucy Snowe sets sail from England to find employment in a girls\u2019 boarding school in the small town of Villette.
