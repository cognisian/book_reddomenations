Second, in typical CreateSpace tradition, the digital to print translation is full of typos; only one or two words defy comprehension, but it is quite annoying.  Third, regarding the actual story, this edition contains both books and is a gem for the Verne completionist.  Without revealing anything, this is truly a voyage and a complex, humorous one at that.  The interpersonal dynamics are more developed than usual for Verne, and there are enough twists to hold one's attention from beginning to end."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "The materials this book is made from are substandard.

Not one of Verne's greatest works, but well worth your time."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A good yarn by the master of yarns, and it is good to see it in print again, as it hardly ever is, in English anyway.
