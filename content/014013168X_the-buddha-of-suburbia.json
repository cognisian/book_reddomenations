When his father is taken up by the artistic Eva, and becomes something of a local celebrity with his yoga seminars, our hero, Karim, sees a new and exciting world opening up, even as he pities his mother, left behind. The whole feel of the era is well-drawn - the craze for the new and exotic, the sex, drugs and music, but also the racism and political discontent.There are some great characters here: the strong-minded Jamila, long-suffering immigrant Changez, and many pretentious types whom Karim encounters through the theatre.Enjoyable read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of the best books of its era that I reread recently, grateful to discover that it really does stand the test of time. Funny, original, moving, evocative, plausible, packed full of wry social commentary and tender towards even its most monstrous characters. And such a distinctive voice! A book to relish."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "My purchase was good. It was used, and I may have purposely bought it like that, even though I only try to purchase books that are \"like new\" or \"new.\" It was sent on time and I have no issues, besides the quality of the outside of the book.Okay, this book is probably one of the greatest pieces of contemporary literature that is available today. It follows Karim, born in England as a second generation Indian to parents, both with ties back to that country. The mother wants to remain tied, but the father loves the idea of this new, first-world ideals and freedom. Karim goes through life now knowing where he belongs, because of his obvious skin tone and his surroundings. It takes place over many years and you see various things happen to Karim. This book has drug use, sexuality, sensuality, and more, but it is just one of those coming-of-age novels that is BRILLIANT. It is a must-read for those who like to read, have an identity crisis, or anything. It's that good and it is something that should be read by most adults."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book shocked me, intrigued me, and captivated me.
