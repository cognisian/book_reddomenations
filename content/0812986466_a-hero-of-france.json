Very worthwhile read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I liked A Hero of France very much, but the reader should be aware that Furst has many characters to introduce who run Resistance missions for the central character Matthieu as well as villains who come from Germany and Croatia.  Matthieu's cell saves downed pilots and smuggles in saboteurs along the northern coast of France.  If the reader keeps in mind that the cell contains about 5 or 6 main characters (Joell, de Lyon, Jules, and Chantal), then the reader need not worry so much about the names of characters who run missions or are less important supporting characters.  Furst's scenes are uniformly suspenseful, and he maintains suspense throughout the book. The material lends itself to many twists and turns.  The story's characterization is enhanced by the 3 main villains, a German police inspector, Spider, and Stephen Kusak.  When the cell is exposed and all must escape Paris on short notice, instead of the usual chase after one main character, the reader is treated to a chase of the entire cell.  In addition, the denouement has a surprise and retrospective last line that is perfect.  As in all Furst novels, the atmosphere and you-are-there quality of his writing remains strong.  I felt that this one was particularly strong on atmospherics, both in Paris and along the northern coast.  This book mostly takes place before the German invasion of Russia, which brought the French Communist Party into the Resistance, but Furst does describe the massive German invasion of Russia toward the end of the book.  The good guys are good and two of the bad guys are very bad.

The City of Light is dark and silent at night. But in Paris and in the farmhouses, barns, and churches of the French countryside, small groups of ordinary men and women are determined to take down the occupying forces of Adolf Hitler. Mathieu, a leader of the French Resistance, leads one such cell, helping downed British airmen escape back to England.\r\n\r\nAlan Furst\u2019s suspenseful, fast-paced thriller captures this dangerous time as no one ever has before. He brings Paris and occupied France to life, along with courageous citizens who outmaneuver collaborators, informers, blackmailers, and spies, risking everything to fulfill perilous clandestine missions. Aiding Mathieu as part of his covert network are Lisette, a seventeen-year-old student and courier; Max de Lyon, an arms dealer turned nightclub owner; Chantal, a woman of class and confidence; Daniel, a Jewish teacher fueled by revenge; Jo\u00eblle, who falls in love with Mathieu; and Annemarie, a willful aristocrat with deep roots in France, and a desire to act.\r\n\r\nAs the German military police heighten surveillance, Mathieu and his team face a new threat, dispatched by the Reich to destroy them all.\r\n\r\nShot through with the author\u2019s trademark fine writing, breathtaking suspense, and intense scenes of seduction and passion, Alan Furst\u2019s A Hero of France is at once one of the finest novels written about the French Resistance and the most gripping novel yet by the living master of the spy thriller.\r\n\r\n\u201cSuspenseful and sophisticated . . .
