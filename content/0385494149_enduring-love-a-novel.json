Terrific descriptions of the characters' tipping points and how actions or non-actions, slight or great, can alter feelings or perceptions, slightly or greatly. Bit confused about the title, but the story will hopefully endure. When it comes to writing, Sir McEwan can pound a pint or two."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "\"...but this pinprick is as notional as a point in Euclidian geometry...\"I earmarked the first page of Chapter Two upon encountering this unique simile author McEwan employs to illustrate a defining moment of his story, an instant from which the entire tale springs.  What marvelous creativity in this author's repertoire!  How does one fill a blank sheet of paper with sentences as rich and vivid as this?  How can you not love an author who is able to conjure \"pinprick,\" \"notional,\" and \"Euclidian\" not only in the same brief clause, but in tight proximity to each other?  Craftsmanship at its very best. Of course, the English are the best writers of English.  And McEwan is one of their best.\"Saturday\" and \"On Chesil Beach\" are my favorite McEwan works, but very much enjoyed finding this earlier novel.  Highly recommend."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A very fascinating book that we read for bookclub.
