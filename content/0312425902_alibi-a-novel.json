A little slow for me and somewhat difficult to relate to the characters.

Perhaps it is a failed effort at character development, but none of the characters is sympathetic, especially the \"heroine\" introduced near the beginning of the book, who starts well but then devolves into such hystrionics and obsessive behavior that she (and the book) loses all credibility.  The premise of the book is interesting, but the execution leaves much to be desired.  Kanon seems to specialize in historical fiction, especially the period in the immediate aftermath of WWII, and this book fits in that genre, but I advise you to skip it and read The Good German (much, much better than the movie, despite its talented cast, which changed the story in ways that detracted markedly from the original) and/or Leaving Berlin instead."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Kanon\u2019s fast-paced story of mystery, intrigue and murder, involves a young American soldier, newly resigned from service, on vacation in Venice, Italy, and a young, troubled, Italian woman.

The story is well written and descriptive, with believable dialogue.Details:In 1946, Adam Miller, released from the U.S. Military, leaves his work in the de-Nazification program in Germany, and decides to visit his mother, in Venice.  Adam learns his mother, Grace Miller, plans to marry a well known well respected, Venetian, Dr. Gianni Maglione.  Adam reluctantly attends a party, at the invitation of his mother, and meets Claudia Grassini, a young Jewish woman, to whom he is immediately attracted.

Alibi is set in Venice - which was largely spared the physical impact of the war - but everyone was affected in some way.
