The relationships between mothers and daughters parallel with the setting of Vietnam as the home country and Russian the Communist motherland was an interesting look on how devoted the two could be and how easily that devotion can be used against one another. I enjoyed this novel so much. It's the story of a young girl and her family that had been torn apart during the division of Vietnam during the Communist's reformation of the north and her adaption to the various places she lives. Her life is torn between the traditions that have been in her family for generations and the appeal of Western freedom and indolence."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "BOOK club selection"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I ordered this book because it was one needed for a class. I was surprised though when I like the book as I don't usually waver from my YA romance books so it was nice to read something new.  At times though I was confused as to when this was happening as we kept being pulled from the past only to be still in her past just steadily closer.Throughout the book you start to feel for the main character and if you're like me you will wonder (sort of SPOILERS) why her uncle is such a jerk and treats her and her mother like they are inconvenient.To be honest I didn't actually finish the book but I do plan to(eventually). There was nothing wrong with the book, I only stopped because I completed the class assignments for this book and then had to start a new book."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I love this story. It's wonderful."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Duong Thu Huong\u2019s Paradise of the Blind covers the impact of the Communist regime on a family with an effective portrayal of family strife that doesn\u2019t get didactic.  Hang is the central character, a North Vietnamese woman we see initially as an \u201cexported worker\u201d in the Soviet Union living in a Spartan dormitory.  She receives a communication from an uncle in Moscow, a party official, which leads to her decision to take a rail cross-country to visit him.The novel alternates between that trip and the sundering of her family.  Hang\u2019s story has three centers of gravity; her almost inhumanly self-sacrificing mother, Que; her full-of-himself maternal uncle, Chinh; and her paternal aunt, Tam.  Her family being torn asunder by those centers began when her maternal uncle, a soldier who had returned from the war and became a local political leader, turned on her father on the grounds that the latter came from a landlord family and forced her mother to denounce him.  The uncle is in charge of local political discipline during a disastrous period of land reform after the end of what the Vietnamese called the American War.  When policies are changed and the uncle is disgraced, the village\u2019s enmity focuses on the mother.Chinh\u2019s nature is revealed early on when he complains to his sister about her meeting with Tam, her sister-in-law.  Although ostensibly an issue of political rectitude, he then complains about the impact it could have on his career.  He does this a few times.  Han\u2019s reaction to that is to blame herself for not raising him right (she was the elder sibling); nothing that Chinh does shakes that loyalty.  When he falls on harder times, she devotes herself to his children even above Hang, which causes one of the main conflicts of the plot.  Part of that choice is because of her issue with Hang\u2019s relationship with Tam.The embitterment of Tam against Chinh (and to some extent Que) because of what he did to her brother is balanced out by an attempt to claim the loyalty of Hang.  Tam, despite having been deprived of everything as a class enemy, was able to work her way back up to a measure of prosperity and takes Hang under her wing, supporting her financially and exhorting her to make the most of herself.  Since Tam is childless and Hang her only sibling\u2019s only child, Tam regards Hang as her family\u2019s last gasp.The characterizations are vivid and well-drawn.  Although Que\u2019s self-sacrifice could have seemed unreal in the hands of a less skilled author, the portrayal of the mix of wanting to hold on to her remaining family and her resentment of the influence on Tam makes her tendency to accord a higher priority to Chinh\u2019s children not unrealistic.  Tam\u2019s story shows her indomitable will and one almost gets the sense that her anger at what had been done her family had much to do with keeping her going.Even the minor characters are well-drawn.  For example, the portraits of the people promoted as political commissars in the village who were no-accounts prior to their promotion have back stories that are rich and engaging."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "It is rather slow and the translation seems unusual."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I bought this book for my Contemporary World Fiction class but I didn't hate reading it.
