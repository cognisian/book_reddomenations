Overall I found the characters frustrating.  I am an extremely A type person.  I have read plenty of books with characters who are opposite, different, diverse from me, but this was apparently too much for my taste.  I really can't think of a single redeeming characteristic of the main character. The other characters also failed to make me feel anything for them.  So little drive, so pitiful, and so incredibly selfish.  If I am going to read a book about characters like that I would at least like it to be fun, this was just depressing. Also, a little more homework would have gone a long way as the majority of this novel was not set in Barcelona.  That's, of course, my fault.  The one redeeming part was the bits of history.

Brooding and anxious, his protagonist Katherine Proctor seeks a new future even at the cost of abandoning her husband and child in Ireland. She is motivated to get far away, to remove herself from small town values, from the deeply ingrained \u201ctroubles\u201d in Ireland, and the low expectations for success that prevail like the cold, heavy mists over the sea and fields. She appears in Barcelona and wanders uncertain and listless in a city and country every bit as haunted by its fractious past as Ireland. How she struggles forward and seeks resolution through painting pulls readers into her predicaments to the end.Interiority defines this story as Toibin explores the internal musing, questioning, fantasizing, and circular thinking of his primary character. At times the story feels claustrophobic, other times it induces a kind of dream state like being lost in the mountain fog above Barcelona. A predominant theme here is abandonment, and Toibin presents it from the perspective of those leaving and those left behind. It tears at the soul and leaves yearning and questioning. A mother abandons her daughter who later leaves behind her son. There\u2019s never a full resolution but sometimes an earnest attempt to understand and bridge the rifts of the past.Toibin is one of our greatest English-writing authors, and it\u2019s a pleasure to explore his early writing with this novel of The South.\\Michael Helquist, MARIE EQUI: Radical Politics and Outlaw Passions"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A magnificent account of a woman painter who leaves Ireland, which is haunted by the troubles and by the IRA for Spain which is haunted by the Spanish Civil war and by Franco's repressive regime."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A brilliant story about a woman, told wonderfully by a man.

The sense of quiet desperation that led to Katherine abandoning hearth and home in Ireland for the alienation of early Franco Spain is tangible, and although she remains a rather remote figure in her struggles to belong, one does feel so for her loss.  Betrayal, innocence, revenge and forgiveness run through the narrative, colliding and eliding in alarming and thought provoking ways.

I read it after visiting Barcelona and Ireland which may have enhanced my reading, but I found in it a strong, sometimes seemingly cold yet also passionate female character, who doesn't justify any of her behavior.
