It had a good story, good plot, but it was done to death by word and sentence repetition, like \"I'm seventeen\" and \"wearing a whore's green boots.\" This really dragged down the flow. \"Yes, I know you are seventeen and wearing a whore's green boots\" I kept saying. I don't know if this is the fault of the writer or the lack of taking responsibility from the editor. I haven't read the author's two other books but my guess is the former.Sad, because I really wanted to enjoy this book. I'll give it 3 stars for effort."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "After reading all the fabulous publicity from well-known writers, magazines, reviewers, NPR -- claiming  this book was \"sensuous\" \"luminous\"  a literary and erotic \"masterpiece\" no less. etc.etc., I was expecting something spectacular.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't live up to this marketing hyperbole. Characterization, Plot, Setting are ignored -- the author stakes everything on her minimalist style, on her opening line \"That day I am 17 and I am wearing the boots of a whore\"  -- and the narrator's tough talking voice and her autoerotic obsession with her own body and its effect on Manet.  Granted, such obsessions may have played a realistic part in the  psyche of a modele de profession in the times of Manet --but by making this the core of the book, the author reduces Victorine to a kind of cartoon who thinks exclusively about sex . Victorine Meurent was actually a very interesting woman -- she became an artist herself and even briefly enjoyed a bit of fame and even rivalry with the man for whom she had posed. She also lived to be eighty while he died at 51 of syphilis, (which some scholars suggest might be proof that they did not have a physical relationship, since she never seems to have developed the disease). The author includes some frank details in some of the sex scenes which don't really enhance them and which some of the other readers here found distasteful. I won't comment on that, but I will say that I thought it odd that given the many sex scenes in the book and the narrator's informing us how much she wants it, there doesn't seem to be any pleasure in it - she doesn't seem to be enjoying it much. That may be intentional on the part of the author, to show us a person who is primarily an object and as presented here, the victim of a patronizing system. Another thing that struck me though was that the key to  the real Victorine's personality wasn't sex drive but ambition - that ambition, clothed in her beauty and fired along by her strong instincts, intelligence and independence, are what allowed her to change her destiny, ending up on the other side of the easel.  From Gibbon's book, we don't get much sense of what must have been a complex personality."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "This is a mediocre, stiffly written novel, a fictionalized treatment of the relationship between Edouard Manet and his model, Victorine Meurant. The author seems to think she\u2019s a female Earnest Hemingway; she writes in a flat, affectless, repetitious and overly-simplified style that sounds like an entry in one of those Hemingway caricature contests. I suppose she\u2019s trying to achieve the voice of Victorine, an uneducated but sexually adventurous factory worker in Paris who became Manet\u2019s model and mistress. The text is liberally sprinkled with French, which is often left untranslated. Although the author dutifully mentions many places and street names, she never for a moment conveys anything of the actual feeling of the life in those streets. It takes more than research to bring the past back to life\u2014 it takes a talent this author lacks.I will, however, give her credit for one thing: she frankly discusses the birth control Manet and his mistress use. Most novels that contain as much sexual description as this one does (none of it very attractive) omit that subject entirely."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "choppy narrative and strained sexual content. however, it was very interesting to learn more about Manet, his painting techniques, his group of artistic and intellectual friends \u2026 and Paris"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Historical novels are my favorite genre when I'm looking for a new read, but I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone. The two protagonists are poorly developed & emotionally flat. The only aspect of the novel that truly drew me into the book was the excellent depiction of the artists' creative process. It was fascinating to read about how the artist & his muse (also an artist) communicated their artistic viewpoints. However, I found it very distasteful to read the sections about the couple's sexual relations. I don't think I'm a prude at all, but I don't find references to feces & birth control in any way sensual. I wish I had read more of the readers' reviews before purchasing this book because it was a waste of time & money."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Gibbon's has captured an artist's eye and the internal thinking of a serious artist in her novel!She is able to convey deep feelings and emotions to her reader and also engage all the senses with her words.I admire her writing and how she conveys the senses through it. The love of color is apparent in her characterizations in Paris Red. The relationships become real and very thoughtful in provoking a reaction as I read about them. She used her characters well and also the city of Paris. The touches of French language made me pause and think about the meaning behind them. Culture and time period are weaved into the story about an artist and his model. The model's reflection about his painted canvases and his use of colors made it very authentic in an artistic realm. The last painting of her seems to lead into a serious evolution in the artist's career. There could be another installment of this story and the characters presented here.I am looking forward to reading a new novel from Gibbons."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I purchased this book because I have a particular interest in Victorine Meurent and was hoping to find that she was well portrayed in this novel.I was disappointed. Victorine is not very interesting in this book, and neither is Manet. His vision was not focused on, her independence was not at all in evidence, let alone her own ambition to be a painter and how, as usual, she was not encouraged to pursue her own dream to paint because she was a woman. I hate to put it this way, but, according to Ms. Gibbon, she's just a victim of a self-absorbed artist. And what is this constant reference to her green boots, 'the boots of a whore'. It would probably have been much better as a short story, because the scenes became repetitive, over and over they're having sex, and then he paints. I really do believe that both of these people in their real lives were much more interesting. This book is just a gimmick to appeal to someone like me who took the bait and bought the book, hoping for a good read about Victorine. I'll never pick up another book by Ms. Gibbon. Read Alias Olympia to get a better idea of Victorine Meurent, although there isn't much known about her."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I read it for fun, then I realized, I just read and it wasn't much fun.The plot is weak, the characters not well developed"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "If you are interested in art or Manet in particular, this is likely not a book you will enjoy.
