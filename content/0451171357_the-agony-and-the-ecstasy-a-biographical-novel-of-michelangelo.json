This book speaks from the heart and mind of an artist. Art is not just something pretty but it expresses emotion, feeling, and life. Otherwise it is just decoration. The title of the book is fitting and perfect because it describes the emotions Michelangelo goes through in becoming an artist and a maestro. It is also a great work of history to get an inside perspective of the Medici family and the power and corruption of the papacy. The last 75 pages or so slowed down a bit and were a bit boring but Michelangelo lived to 90 and Irving needed to rap it up after being so detailed in the earlier parts of Michelangelo's life."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Book is in excellent condition. Thank you"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The book came recommended and when the brick arrived (758 pages!), I wondered if I'd get through it. The writing seemed flat and the young Michelangelo just barely arousing curiosity but...something sparked as my reading progressed and, not unlike the mystic white marble that Michelangelo revered, the tremendous work of Irving Stone came to reveal itself after many turning of the pages. This book is similar to a work of art, and while not perfect (like iron stains in good marble), soulfully satisfying in the end. Michelangelo was a lover of beauty, whether it came in male or female form, sculpting and painting them as God had created them. Stone masterfully recreated Michelangelo's imaginative thinking process and \"crusty\" dialogue, absorbing the trials and tribulations of an artist during the tumultuous times of pontificates playing musical chairs, and whose capricious demands challenged Michelangelo's integrity and self-worth. \"Man passes, only works of art are immortal.\" Stone has chiseled a fully realized Michelangelo for me and I look forward to seeing for myself, some the celestial works he left behind when I depart for Rome next week."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Beautiful!"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I tried - I really tried....I made it through the first 300 pages and it just didn't hook me.
