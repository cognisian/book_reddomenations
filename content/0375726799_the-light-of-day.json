The son of an Egyptian mother and British father, Simpson is embittered by the unwillingness of either nation to claim him as one of its own.When caught in the act of burglarizing a hotel room in Athens, Simpson is blackmailed into driving a Lincoln to Istanbul. Of course, the plan does not go well for Simpson, who soon finds himself caught between the schemers who induced him to make the trip and the Turkish police, who want to use him for their own ends. This well-paced thriller is sprinkled with moments of levity, nicely balancing the darkness that enshrouds Simpson as he becomes embroiled in a criminal plot. While the criminal characters are not as fully developed as Simpson, the novel works because Ambler makes the reader see the world through Simpson's eyes and feel his mounting sense of dread as events unfold.Ambler creates an effective atmosphere. Even when there seems to be little action, Ambler keeps the story in motion -- there's always something happening that holds the reader's attention. There are elements of a mystery in the story as Simpson tries to discover the purpose of driving the Lincoln to Istanbul, but that secret is revealed well before the novel's end. At that point, suspense builds as Simpson finds himself caught between the desires of the police and the crooks. The suspense is palpable, and for that reason I recommend The Light of Day as a true thriller. I would give The Light of Day 4 1/2 stars if that option were available."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Ambler's book is very enjoyable book if you enjoy cold war era spy novels.

This is not 007, but their is a degree of suspense that keeps you on edge. You cannot help but feel some sympathy for the main character, Arthur. He is a bumbling thief, caught in his own trap. Only through his clever moves does he avoid being discovered. This is one of those stories were the climax and resolution come at the very end. In some ways it's a let down, but it does not betray the internal logic of the plot and character development."}]}, "authors": ["Eric Ambler"], "isbn": "0375726799", "longitude": 28.9651646, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "The Light of Day", "word_cloud": "clever different style fun duty theatrical story line rather pathetic anti hero protagonist not seek takeaway perfect narrator story morally corrupt yet sympathetic better place visit worse downwards petty thief unemployed journalist occasional tourist finest creation son mother father embitter unwillingness nation claim caught act burglarize hotel room blackmail drive course plan go well soon find caught schemer induce make trip police want use end thriller sprinkle moment levity nicely balance darkness become embroiled criminal plot criminal character fully develop work make see world eye feel mount sense dread event create effective atmosphere even seem little action keep story motion always something happen hold attention element mystery story try discover purpose drive secret reveal well point suspense build find catch desire police crook suspense palpable reason recommend true thriller star option available enjoyable enjoy cold war era spy novel good character plot lot local color recommend enjoyable armchair traveler enjoy story hapless antihero suck scrape dodgy ethic misapplication imagination plain poor timing like eric excellent pacing give star protagonist interest poorly write feel mediocre star rat others classic want movie base friend mine insist glad degree suspense keep edge help sympathy main character bumble thief caught trap only clever move avoid discover stories climax resolution come end way let betray internal logic plot character development", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Mystery & Suspense"], "summary": "The Light of Day was the basis for Jules Dassin\u2019s classic film, Topkapi.\r\n\r\nWhen Arthur Abdel Simpson first spots Harper in the Athens airport, he recognizes him as a tourist unfamiliar with city and in need of a private driver.
