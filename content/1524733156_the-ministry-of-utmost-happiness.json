But at least we could learn and educate ourselves on the issues from both sides..this book is an attempt at that education and very relate able."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Extremely complicated and difficult to follow.

There were moments, however, that I was a bit lost with the characters and had to go back several pages and re-read to get up to speed.If that was bad, than wait until you get to the second part of the story. I was hoping we would get more depth into Anjum\u2019s story, however it essentially started a brand new book with dozens of new characters and tons of political scenes that are hard to follow.I kept reading, hoping to find the \u201caha\u201d moment where both stories collided-but was disappointed.Had the author focused on Anjum\u2019s story I think it would have been a beautiful book, however this was just too messy to read."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The author is great to read, the story is quite rich and beautiful.

Each of its characters is indelibly, tenderly rendered. Its heroes are people who have been broken by the world they live in and then rescued, patched together by acts of love\u2014and by hope.\r\nThe tale begins with Anjum\u2014who used to be Aftab\u2014unrolling a threadbare Persian carpet in a city graveyard she calls home. We encounter the odd, unforgettable Tilo and the men who loved her\u2014including Musa, sweetheart and ex-sweetheart, lover and ex-lover; their fates are as entwined as their arms used to be and always will be. We meet Tilo\u2019s landlord, a former suitor, now an intelligence officer posted to Kabul. And then we meet the two Miss Jebeens: the first a child born in Srinagar and buried in its overcrowded Martyrs\u2019 Graveyard; the second found at midnight, abandoned on a concrete sidewalk in the heart of New Delhi.\r\n\r\nAs this ravishing, deeply humane novel braids these lives together, it reinvents what a novel can do and can be. The Ministry of Utmost Happiness demonstrates on every page the miracle of Arundhati Roy\u2019s storytelling gifts.\r\n\r\n\u201cPropulsive, playful . . . this new book finds Roy the artist prospering with stories, and writing in gorgeous, supple prose. Again and again beautiful images refresh our sense of the world. Sections of the book filled me with awe\u2014not just as a reader, but as a novelist\u2014for the sheer fidelity and beauty of detail\u2014a terrific novelistic noticing. Roy writes with astonishing vividness.\u201d The New York Times", "asin": "1524733156", "rank": "5575", "city": "Delhi", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51W0Yr9vsKL.jpg", "country": "India", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
