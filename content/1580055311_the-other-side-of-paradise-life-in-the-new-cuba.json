Ms. Cooke's curiosity, sensibility, humility and style make her the perfect guide. Her exploration and the discoveries she makes as she tries to understand this fascinating planet that orbits so close to our own, is a pleasure to read. It is a book that attempts to understand a people and their country.  On Planet Cuba Ms. Clarke is a trustworthy guide. Read it before you go or after. You will understand so much more."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book was recommended ahead of a trip to Cuba. Arrived in perfect condition. Can't wait to read it!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I really liked the stories and characters in this book.  It works to convey the psycho-social-political mindsets of young Cubans from different walks of life.  However, I thought the writing was unnecessarily verbose and sometimes cumbersome. Nevertheless,  this was a great read in anticipation of my upcoming trip to Cuba."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Having just visited Havana I have found myself intrigued. The more questions I have answered about Cuba the more and more questions I have. I decided to pick up this book and read more about this country which Cooke referred to as a \"Dollhouse of prestige and poverty.\" Filled with Cubans whose \"lives still seemed like snow globes shaken by someone else.\" This is a fabulous read that follows a variety of Cubans as they navigate all that Cuba is and all they wished it would be. The places mentioned are places I just came back from, the food eaten I can almost still taste, and the observations depicted are memories I will never forget. My own travel accounts were verified on one page only to turn he page and find myself completely shocked. For all who have been to Cuba or those who would choose flip the pages to experience a beautiful country that finds itself both untouched and micromanaged- this is he book for you."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Poorly written.  A struggle to reach half way.  Was it just me?  I looked up other reviews.  Quite a few readers were equally bored.  So I gave up and did not return for the second half."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Inspiring and exceptionally wellWritten.

I read it on my recent trip to Havana, and it was great to have Julia Cooke's insight into the lives of the people of Cuba. It made my trip so much richer."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The writer gets into the minds of regular Cuban folk.  Well written, I recommend you read this before your trip to Cuba.
