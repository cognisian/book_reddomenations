These four short novellas are set in New York society, each giving the reader a glimpse of the conventions and conduct of \u201cpolite society\u201d during the last half of the 19th century (not always polite and frequently unkind). Even in these relatively short works, Whaton\u2019s characters are people we come to know and understand and the writing is nuanced. Each story comes to a very satisfying conclusion.

I am not a big fan of the short story, but these novellas hit just the right length."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I especially liked the cameo appearance of John Ruskin as a young fellow developing his taste in art, whose writings and powerfully expressed radical opinions (at the time) which were to become the Bible and Gospel of Great Art rolled into one, later on in the 19th century - as he influenced the taste and already romantically deviating outlook on the field of art, developing in the mind of our protagonist, young Lewis Raycie.  It struck me that here Wharton was inserting real historical characters into her fiction long before Doctorow was doing it.  Anyway, a masterful tale of the ongoing ignorance of one generation as it tries to fathom the next generation's taste in art; initially rejecting it with howls of rage and derision, and then as both it's aesthetic (and of course, economic) value begins to take hold - that generation is forced to change it's mind, etc,. etc.  Well, Caveat Emptor - but then, Tempus Fugit, and the cycle starts anew.  The small tragedies that accompany this cycle are the backbone of this novella, and will always be worth remembering."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Edith Wharton never leaves her theme of independent women and the costs they pay in life, love and society for being honest.

This book is a wondeful book about social class and the barriers that woman faced in the era in which it was writte.

Included in this remarkable quartet are False Dawn, which concerns the stormy relationship between a domineering father and his son; The Old Maid, the best known of the four, in which a young woman's secret illegitimate child is adopted by her best friend -- with devastating results; The Spark, about a young man's moral rehabilitation, which is \"sparked\" by a chance encounter with Walt Whitman; and New Year's Day, an O. Henryesque tale of a married woman suspected of adultery.
