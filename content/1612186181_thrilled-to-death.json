Great storyline that never falls apart. Enough details of police process without boring me (although I am into details). Only thing that's beginning to stick in my brain is that poor Detective Jackson sure has a lot of troubles in his own family. I'll keep reading cuz I can't stop.  Good read, all of them (so far)."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Wow wow wow \ud83d\ude33I love this series it's never a dull moment! Keeps me on the edge of my seat!

Pressured by the chief of police, Jackson and his team descend into Courtney\u2019s wanton world, uncovering a handful of suspects with disturbing motives.\r\n\r\nAlthough it\u2019s hardly the first time a case has led Jackson into dark territory, the discovery that the two disappearances are connected brings him face-to-face with the last person he expects.
