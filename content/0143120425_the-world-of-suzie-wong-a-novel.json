Anybody know if that ever happened?"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I liked this book so much that was sorry when I finished it.  Liked reading about old times in China; it held my interest.  The ending is typical, nothing dramatic, and this may be the only downside to the novel.  If you like light reading with an interesting plot and likeable characters, then you will enjoy it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Fascinating...and bonus....it ends well; no tragedy.
