Nesbo has a knack of making his reader think one thing is happening.....but is it really? There were many times where I just could not put this book down! Although this can be a stand alone book, I found it to have a lot more of an impact because I felt I knew the characters from previous books."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "It was hard to keep track of all the characters."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Similar to other books in the series I\u2019ve read It takes a while to get going. I was torn as part of me enjoyed it because I couldn\u2019t figure out who the killer was, and feeling like the story was dragging on at some points.  For about the first quarter of the book I nearly gave up but I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t because as always it\u2019s a well thought out plot.

There's a weird scene where a cop is with another investigator, who goes to the trunk of his car and the cop hears a metallic clink that he doesn't quite understand. Cut to some other scene. Nothing ever comes of that clink.
