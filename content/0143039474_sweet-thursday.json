Familiar landmarks also appear in post-war, tattered glory: the Palace Flophouse, Lee Chong\u2019s Grocery store (under new management), the Bear Flag \u201cestablishment\u201d and Doc\u2019s messy but beloved Western Biological Laboratory.  Despite hard times and some painful memories the residents welcome Doc\u2019s return home but gradually realize that something is wrong with their genial friend.  Things begin to pop at the arrival of peppy but down-at-heels Suzy; the sheriff sizes her up right quick, but the new kid in town is lucky to get a job at all\u2014thanks to Fauna, the street-smart Madam.  Once again it is a case of \u201cthe best-laid plans of mice and men\u201d which unfold with characteristic setbacks and misreading of non-verbal clues. Feelings are tromped on while schemes are hatched; mostly with an eye to making Doc feel happy again and helping him write his scientific paper on octopi. But how can he visit the tide pools of La Jolla at the right tide while nursing a broken arm?  Readable and entertaining this study in what friends will do for friends proves vintage Steinbeck\u2014including an explanation for why he bowed to some previous literary criticism; comic relief is also provided by references to local history, which bear no relation to plot advancement. Readers may expect a veritable parade of whack-job characters, as \u201cthe boys\u201d and the Madam finagle to get Doc what they feel he needs most."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Not his best work I don\u2019t think but it was ok"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Steinbeck could almost have called this postwar novel CANNERY ROW REVISITED.
