Really the only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because of the notable lack of photographs. It cried out for them.She was an amazing, adventurous woman. It reminded me of Jane Digby (a great read) before her. Although Gertrude was, perhaps, a more substantial woman. The historical rise of Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Palestine/Israel and Saudi Arabia and the tribal rivalries highlight today's events.

She was at one time the most powerful woman in the British Empire: a nation builder, the driving force behind the creation of modern-day Iraq. Born in 1868 into a world of privilege, Bell turned her back on Victorian society, choosing to read history at Oxford and going on to become an archaeologist, spy, Arabist, linguist, author (of Persian Pictures, The Desert and the Sown, and many other collections), poet, photographer, and legendary mountaineer (she took off her skirt and climbed the Alps in her underclothes).\r\n\r\nShe traveled the globe several times, but her passion was the desert, where she traveled with only her guns and her servants. Her vast knowledge of the region made her indispensable to the Cairo Intelligence Office of the British government during World War I. She advised the Viceroy of India; then, as an army major, she traveled to the front lines in Mesopotamia. There, she supported the creation of an autonomous Arab nation for Iraq, promoting and manipulating the election of King Faisal to the throne and helping to draw the borders of the fledgling state.\r\n\r\nGertrude Bell, vividly told and impeccably researched by Georgina Howell, is a richly compelling portrait of a woman who transcended the restrictions of her class and times, and in so doing, created a remarkable and enduring legacy.\r\n\r\n\" \u2026 there\u2019s never a dull moment in the peerless life of this trailblazing character.\" - Kirkus Reviews", "asin": "0374531358", "rank": "105732", "city": "Cairo", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51WPO7meToL.jpg", "country": "Egypt", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
