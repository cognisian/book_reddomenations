I read it because some call it a classic. I found it to be a classic example of diarrhea of a sick mind. The imagery on almost every page made me want to puke. After months of reading this book to he very end, I still can't tell you what the plot is or even what the book is really about. It seems to be set in Europe near the end of WW2 and everybody in it appears to be insane."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The book is in many ways like Ulysses in that it is encyclopedic. Joyce said he wanted people to be able to recreate Dublin from his book, were the city to be somehow destroyed. Pynchon has allowed us to duplicate America at the beginning of the end of its empire. And just as Ulysses is full of Irish \u2018inside\u2019 jokes, GR is full of American history jokes, and, given Pynchon\u2019s scientific background, full of silly science jokes and puns that only a nerd would get.The main theme revolves around the Puritanical nature of America and Western Europe and the Calvinistic concept of the Puritan \"elect\" or chosen and the \"preterite\". Slothrop is one of the preterite; he had a great, great Aunt who was hung in Salem. His father actually sold the infant Slothrop to one of the chosen, Professor Jampf, a contemporary of Pavlov. The deal was that the child would get a Harvard education in return for Jampf being able to give the baby an erection through stimuli, like the dogs \u2013 but even more so, in that Jampf believed that you could condition people to react to stimuli that aren't there \u2013 the lack of stimuli would cause a reaction \u2013 thus the continuing theme and chapters called \u201cLess than Zero.\u201dSo this less than zero, something more than just on and off, for example, reflects Pynchon\u2019s quantum physics background \u2013 in the same way, the Schrodinger\u2019s cat is both alive and dead until the wave function collapses. Newton\u2019s world was yes and no; Einstein\u2019s was yes, no and maybe.So, since most are the preterite, they are expendable, they are Pavlovian dogs \u2013 their lives are controlled, videotaped, and generally screwed with as the chosen ones decide\u2026 human chess pieces. The chosen have come to be big chemical companies and their scientists (Pynchon argues that with du Pont\u2019s development of plastic, scientists no longer had to limit themselves to what nature allowed \u2013 they could now beat nature and do whatever they wanted).  Constantly Pynchon talks about GE, du Pont, ICI (big English chem Company), Dutch Shell and IG Farben. In fact, these guys are the ones running the war, again as a big experiment\u2026 Pynchon ponders why all of the above companies have contributed to the V-2 \u2013 they share info, parts, data all during the war, and why not? His chapter In the Zone reflects the world of these companies after the war has ended\u2026 the unchosen preterite cannot go back to pre-war life\u2026 they have been programmed by war, to accept war as normal\u2026 so the new Zone is the cold war world into which we were born\u2026 and paranoia is rightly a part of our world \u2013 the ABC unit spies on the CDE unit which tries to gain the upper hand over the EFD people, ad infinitum. Among the chosen, everything is permissible and we the preterite take that as normal.If you recall, Pynchon mentions the one African tribe that was taken over by the Germans in the 1930s (then, they were given an alphabet because you can\u2019t control without the language of Christianity, \u201cin the beginning was the word\u201d). Now in Germany, the tribe refuses to procreate \u2013 members come up with perverse sexual practices, anything with anyone or anything or any animal just to keep from having kids. They want no part of it \u2013 they seek the glorious death that Hemingway says is our only chance at a noble act. And in perfect Pynchon humor, the Germans are crazy \u2013 what will happen if there\u2019s no one to turn into slaves? How will we live?We accept as normal that the OSS is in cahoots with the FBI and fights for power against the Stasi or against the OMB \u2013 a series of ridiculous initials \u2013 bureaucracies that are above country, like big corporations. Most of GR takes place after the war, in the zone when Russians and Americans and Turks and Africans are selling secrets, drugs, women, and civilizations as a way to continue holding power/money now that the war is over. The war allowed everything \u2013 so now everything is still allowed, the war continues as another phase of the experiment. A large part of the book is the list of perversions we preterite can be led into, tempted by the chosen as a Pavlovian experiment, just to feel something real \u2013 we\u2019ll take pain, abuse, torture, eat shit, literally, anything to experience something real because our lives as preterite are not real.Here\u2019s the clever part: early in section 2, Pynchon wonders if the guilt and repression that we Puritans have, the stuff Freud brought to light, don\u2019t actually come to life in the form of people. Our sexual guilt is now alive in a certain part of the population, for example, and thus there are crazy people, doing crazy things everywhere \u2013 including crazy scientists, salesmen, generals, you name it. Then Pynchon asks which came first, crazy people or the Puritan repression that made crazy people. Did the war make the V-2 or did V-2 technology beget the war? Did the war make western cultures crazy or did the innate craziness make the war? Thus the central theme: does the rocket find Slothrop\u2019s conquests or do the women call down the V-2? In a very quantum physics way, Pynchon questions cause and effect. Did Reagan create Ollie North or did North create Reagan? This is a very deep question \u2013 and one that could lead you, like Slothrop, into some very paranoid thoughts.Long before the end of the book, Slothrop simply evaporates \u2013 he goes from Slothrop to Zoot Suit Man to a reporter to Rocketman until his personality unravels. His quest to find out who he is and who is controlling him leads to either insanity or to dissipationBut, there\u2019s a chance that maybe it was Slothrop\u2019s insanity that started him on the quest \u2013 maybe the entire book is nothing but the ravings of an increasingly paranoid schizophrenic? Or was he turned into one by those early penile experiments?We can\u2019t know because we are living the experiment the chosen have made for us (can we be made to react with less than zero stimuli?)\u2026 or our innate insanity has us so paranoid we spook at everything\u2026 or we\u2019re paranoid for good reason.Maybe GR was a product of the 60s\u2026 maybe it was once too fantastical\u2026 but these days the book can seem tame compared to one hour of watching CNN or Fox. I think GR was once a tough read, but now it\u2019s as accessible as a fairy tale.(Trump called Kim Jon Un \u201cRocketman\u201d\u2026  coincidence? I don\u2019t think so. More like prescience on Pynchon\u2019s part. Both the Korean supreme leader (a Pynchon term for sure) and Trump (Captain Chaos) fit perfectly as characters into GR without skipping a beat.)"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent product.

This must have been about the time that the paperback edition first came out. I began reading it but couldn\u2019t quite make out what it was supposed to be. I didn\u2019t make it past the first few pages before abandoning it. That was over 40 years ago now and quite a bit has ensued in the world in the mean time and I am not the person who I was at the time.  The world, as I see it, and I, as I see myself, are quite different now. That, I think, is one of the themes of the novel. People construct their own reality and people need a constructible and explainable reality.The main theme that I take from \u201cGravity\u2019s Rainbow\u201d is the need for people to create a controllable reality and the effect on them if that is not possible.  WW2, in the novel, destroys the sense of control that people have. Early in the novel, the V2 rocket is an agent of that loss of control. It plummets at supersonic speed. The sound of its plunge reaches people after its explosion and destruction. The effect comes before the cause.  People feel helpless in the face of it and psychologically fail.  They seek new beliefs, new constructs, anything to regain that control. Science, mysticism, and anything are shown in the novel to be mechanisms whereby people seek that control. Later in the novel, the rocket is shown to have taken on mystic significance and is incorporated as part of the psychological explanation that provide people with the illusion of comprehension and control of their surroundings.\u201cGravity\u2019s Rainbow\u201d may be difficult, at times, but it is a book that rewards reading.  There are passages that are laugh-out-loud funny. There are passages of profound insight and there are passages of beautiful English. It is book that entertains and instructs. It will reward many readings. I found myself marking sections and going back to read them because they are just so good. This book may be difficult but it is accessible and it is enjoyable."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This novel is bomb. I loved it. Warpedy brain in all sorts of ways.

Literature", "Historical Fiction", "WWII"], "summary": "Winner of the 1973 National Book Award, Gravity's Rainbow is a postmodern epic, a work as exhaustively significant to the second half of the twentieth century as Joyce's Ulysses was to the first. Its sprawling, encyclopedic narrative and penetrating analysis of the impact of technology on society make it an intellectual tour de force.\r\n\r\nLengthy, complex, and featuring a large cast of characters, the narrative is set primarily in Europe at the end of World War II, and centers on the design, production and dispatch of V-2 rockets by the German military. In particular, it features the quest undertaken by several characters to uncover the secret of a mysterious device named the \"Schwarzger\u00e4t\" (\"black device\"), slated to be installed in a rocket with the serial number \"00000\".\r\n\r\nTraversing a wide range of knowledge, the novel transgresses boundaries between high and low culture, between literary propriety and profanity, and between science and speculative metaphysics.\r\n\r\nThe novel shared the 1974 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction with A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories by Isaac Bashevis Singer. Although selected by the Pulitzer Prize jury on fiction for the 1974 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, a single passage involving coprophilia offended the other members of the Pulitzer board, who rejected the selection. No Pulitzer Prize was awarded for fiction that year. The novel was nominated for the 1973 Nebula Award for Best Novel.\r\n\r\nTIME named the novel one of its \"All-Time 100 Greatest Novels\", a list of the best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005 and it is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest American novels ever written.\r\n\r\nWikipedia", "asin": "0143039946", "rank": "17057", "city": "London", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ruv1DR2pL.jpg", "country": "England", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
