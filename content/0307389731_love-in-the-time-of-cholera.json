He and the rest of our group was out climbing a mountain to reach one of the magnificent waterfalls in the area. Although Garcia Marquez is a Noble Prize for Literature, and this book is a masterpiece, anyone who has read this book will question how this book could have been included in a reading list for a teenager.I reread this book as part of a Lifelong Learning course during which we read a large portion of the author\u2019s work. Love in the Time of Cholera is the most enjoyable, readable, of his work. There is also a Good Film that follows the story very closely.Basically, the story is about a Latino man who falls in love. The girl is very haughty, bad-tempered and Beautiful. At first she encourages his attentions, but then inexplicably shuts him out and marries a doctor from a rich, prominent family.. he lives his life, waiting for her husband to die.Some readers may be shocked at the way the author includes detailed accounts of the man\u2019s 57 years of sexual activity with a variety of women, including his young, 13, ward."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The book itself came in great condition.

The plot was barely passable and I hated the writer's almost complete refusal to use direct quotes in characters' interactions. An important way a reader gets to know the characters of a book is through the way they speak...their grammar, their use of slang, their tendency to speak either bluntly or vaguely. Without direct quotes, the writing felt more like reading someone's diary, with little more than summations of events and conversations.That said, I am wondering about Marquez's book \"100 Years of Solitude.\" Can anyone tell me, did he write it the same way he wrote this?"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "good"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Good book!"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Hours of my life I can't get back.

When Fermina eventually chooses to marry a wealthy, well-born doctor, Florentino is devastated, but he is a romantic. As he rises in his business career he whiles away the years in 622 affairs--yet he reserves his heart for Fermina. Her husband dies at last, and Florentino purposefully attends the funeral. Fifty years, nine months, and four days after he first declared his love for Fermina, he will do so again.\r\n\r\nThe story occurs mainly in an unnamed port city somewhere near the Caribbean Sea and the Magdalena River. Given that Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez is mentioned as the \"author of the national anthem\", the country is likely Colombia. While the city remains unnamed throughout the novel, descriptions and names of places suggest it is based on Cartagena with the addition of the Magdalena River, which meets the sea at the nearby city of Barranquilla.", "asin": "0307389731", "rank": "7519", "city": "Cartagena", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51GxFpytqiL.jpg", "country": "Spain", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
