Katherine\u2019s sister, Juana of Castile, wife of Philip of Burgundy and mother of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, is portrayed as \u201cJuana the Mad,\u201d whose erratic behavior included keeping her beloved late husband\u2019s coffin beside her for years. But historian Julia Fox, whose previous work painted an unprecedented portrait of Jane Boleyn, Anne\u2019s sister, offers deeper insight in this first dual biography of Katherine and Juana, the daughters of Spain\u2019s Ferdinand and Isabella, whose family ties remained strong despite their separation. Looking through the lens of their Spanish origins, Fox reveals these queens as flesh-and-blood women\u2014equipped with character, intelligence, and conviction\u2014who are worthy historical figures in their own right. \r\n\r\nWhen they were young, Juana\u2019s and Katherine\u2019s futures appeared promising. They had secured politically advantageous marriages, but their dreams of love and power quickly dissolved, and the unions for which they\u2019d spent their whole lives preparing were fraught with duplicity and betrayal. Juana, the elder sister, unexpectedly became Spain\u2019s sovereign, but her authority was continually usurped, first by her husband and later by her son. Katherine, a young widow after the death of Prince Arthur of Wales, soon remarried his doting brother Henry and later became a key figure in a drama that altered England\u2019s religious landscape. \r\n\r\nOusted from the positions of power and influence they had been groomed for and separated from their children, Katherine and Juana each turned to their rich and abiding faith and deep personal belief in their family\u2019s dynastic legacy to cope with their enduring hardships. Sister Queens is a gripping tale of love, duty, and sacrifice\u2014a remarkable reflection on the conflict between ambition and loyalty during an age when the greatest sin, it seems, was to have been born a woman.\r\n", "asin": "B0050DIWMA", "rank": "143594", "city": "Madrid", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-OeFz%2BOOL.jpg", "country": "Spain", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
