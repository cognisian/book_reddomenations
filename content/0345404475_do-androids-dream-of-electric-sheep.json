Quite a feat. Quite a novel. But then again, maybe we shouldn\u2019t be so surprised - after all, this is Philip K. Dick. One of the most bizarre reading experiences anyone could possibly encounter. Rather than attempting to comment on plot or the sequence of events (too wild to synopsize), here are ten ingredients the one and only PKD mixes together in his outlandish science fictional stew:Rick Deckard - the novel\u2019s main character, a bounty hunter on the city police force assigned to track down and destroy human-like androids that have emigrated illegally from Mars. The year 2021, the place San Francisco in the aftermath of nuclear war, deadly dust everywhere, many species wiped out. The government says androids must remain on Mars and continue doing all the dirty work for humans who have migrated to the red planet. Darn! The problem is androids, especially the most recently improved version with their new Nexus-6 brain unit, have been given way too much intelligence.Voigt-Kampff Empathy Test \u2013 Fortunately, bounty hunters can administer a test to determine who is human and who is android. The central dilemma with androids \u2013 without the very human capacity to feel compassion for others, an android is nothing more than a solitary predator, a cold killer capable of murdering humans left and right to eventually take over. A true stroke of PKD irony since there are a number of instances where androids appear to have deep feelings and empathy for each other and even humans. Meanwhile, the human bounty hunters are expected to eliminate or \u201cretire\u201d androids with no more feelings than if they were disassembling a vacuum cleaner. This philosophical conundrum emerges repeatedly throughout the novel.John Isidore \u2013Since he scored low on his IQ test, labeled a special and chickenhead, Isidore can\u2019t emigrate to Mars. He lives alone in an empty, decaying apartment building on the outskirts of the city and drives a truck for an animal rescue company. When at home Isadore watches hawkers and comedians on his TV when he's not grabbing the handles of his black empathy box that enables him to fuse his feeling with all of life, a major tenet of the new religion of Mercerism, founded by that superior being, Wilbur Mercer. Such belief and behavior leads to yet another area of PKD-style philosophic inquiry. However, by the end of the novel it becomes clear anyone, human or android, should think twice before putting their life in the hands of a chickenhead.Buster Friendly \u2013 Leading TV personality and all-around funny guy who makes announcements and pronouncements on what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fake on topics near and dear to the hearts of the remaining survivors. Topics can range from the latest reports on nuclear fallout to his biggest rival, Wibur Mercer.Mood Organ \u2013 In this futuristic world, there\u2019s no need for drugs and for good reason: men and women like Rick Deckard and his wife have a \u201cmood organ\u201d where they can simply set the dial for a stimulant or a tranquilizer, a hit of venom to better win an argument or even set the dial for a state of ecstatic sexual bliss. Obviously there\u2019s some upside here. 2021 isn\u2019t that far away. Lets hope inventors are hard at work as you read these words.Rachael Rosen \u2013 Beautiful daughter of Eldon Rosen, founder of a major manufacturer of androids. But wait: Is Rachael a real human or could she turn out to be one of those very intelligent Nexus-6 androids? Time for Rick Deckard to take out his equipment and give Rachael the Voigt-Kampff Empathy Test. Either way, Rachael infuses serious energy into the story. One of my favorite lines is when Rick Deckard asks himself after a phone call with Rachael. \u201cWhat kind of world is it when an android phones up a bounty hunter and offers him assistance?\u201dHappy Dog Pet Shop \u2013 One of the largest pet shops in the Bay Area, they currently have an ostrich in their display window, the bird recently arrived from the Cleveland zoo. What a prize! Rick Deckard is hooked \u2013 he stops and stares at the ostrich as he walks to work and later places a call to check on their asking price. Whoa! The price is outrageous. Rick knows he would have to eliminate an entire string of androids just for the down payment. But, my goodness \u2013 to own one\u2019s very own ostrich.Kipple - As John Isidore states as a matter-of-fact: \u201cKipple is useless objects, like junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum wrappers or yesterday\u2019s homeopape. When nobody\u2019s around, kipple reproduces itself. For instance, if you go to bed leaving any kipple around your apartment, when you wake up the next morning there\u2019s twice as much of it. It always gets more and more.\u201d Sounds as ridiculous as the medieval idea of spontaneous generation. Perhaps we should take into account that John Isidore is, after all, a chickenhead.Luba Luft \u2013 On the list of androids, Luba is currently a leading opera singer for the lead company in San Francisco. Come on, Rick Deckard, do you really want to eliminate someone (or something) that is making such a formidable contributing to the arts? PKD has Rick and a fellow bounty hunter discuss this very question as they follow orders from their higher-ups.Real and Electric Animals \u2013 Creatures of all stripes and varieties add much color to the story. In addition to the above mentioned ostrich, there\u2019s a horse, a sheep, cat, goat, spider, donkey, crow and toad. Some are real, others electric. A PKD book worth reading to discover the truth down to the last four-legged wiggly."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Detest how the female characters were written. But this book has become a scifi staple, so it is what it is. The film adaptations were improvements to the original source novel. Lots of gumshoe detectiving with a hapless main character you almost don\u2019t root for - yet he is the hero. A hero without a moral compass, who tries to create one for himself, and fails."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I really liked this story better than Blade Runner.  I was expecting it  to  be like the movie but it was not at all.  PKD did not go in for the violence that  Ridoey Scott used in the movie.  At first it was hard to get the movie images out of my mind an see the story as it is written but about half way through i got a new prespective .I have not seen Bladerunner 2049.
