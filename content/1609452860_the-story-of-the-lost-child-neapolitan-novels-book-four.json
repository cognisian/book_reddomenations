The1st book was a intro, with the bacgroubd of this story, and the characters, environments, families and friends of the key roles. The friend Lila was very brilliant, very talented, and I was attracted by her too. The first half was kind of slow, and it was easily got lost in those many itallian names of the little friends. But soon the story became very compelling. It was interesting that I was resonated to this story in many aspects, although I grew up in a totally different country and time. The cultrure, the teenager\u2019s love, the competitive but lovable friendship, and later motherhood, all sounds very familiar. From this standing point, Eleanor was writing for all women.The second book was even more touching, Lila\u2019s betrayal and her stupid mistakes were all forgiven. After all, who didnt make stupid mistakes at age of 16?The third story introduced  the Italy history in 1960-1970, and I did some extensive reading to learn for the first time what had happened at that time. From the second half of the 3rd book, i got so mad of Eleanor \u2018s choice, and at a point cant stand this anymore. I just dont understand the character, the whole story fell apart. It seemed that if a woman cant control her emotion, her education doesnt help at all. She seemed to be  a bad influence to her little girls.  I just fastfowarded to finish the story.Until the last quarter of the 4th book, I got indulged into the story again. Lila\u2019s misfortune was due to her fate, also due to her intention of self destroyness. She has so much talent, but never had the confidence to love herself and push away all the beautiful things. By then, Eleanor finally turned back into an independent lady, and I forgave her too. It was upset to see Lila and Eleanor\u2019s 60-year friendship ended. Went through the 4 books, I felt they were my friends too. It was always very sad to say goodbye to friends.I love Eleanor\u2019s writing. And I think it\u2019s a feminist book. Right or wrong, the book described very authentic story."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I liked it. It is real life. Filtered a bit, changed here and there, but it breathes.

Definitely a tour de force, these Neapolitan Novels are one of the best series I've ever read.  In fact, I've never read anything like them.

The ending blew me away!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This is the last book of the series, and although the first quarter of the book was somewhat boring and frustrating, after that, it picks up the pace and the vigor of complicated psychology of Lenu and Lila, politics and crimes all the way to 21st century.  No spoiler, but the ending is not disappointing at all, quite fantastic as well.  Lila is a fantastic and original character, mysterious, complex, intriguing, endlessly surprising, always one step ahead of everyone and beyond the reader's imagination.  Lenu, although she is frustrating at times with her whining and helplessness, is a good character, to tell the story with balance and less intensity, sharing with the reader her own complex and often ambivalent feelings about Lila and Naples,--awe, suspicions, envy and compassion, genuine worries and grief, and in the end, resignation about the  \"splendid and shadowy friendship\" and real life inclining \"toward obscurity not clarity\"  It is a story about the volatile and fragile world at a constant peril of vanishing, or dissolving margins--Naples surrounded by beauty and violence--the splendid sea,  Vesuvius, Mafias, history of blood, and garbage of human cruelty, suicides and murders and exploitation, corruption--nothing but the past is secure."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "THe tragic denouement of Elena Ferrante's superb Neaplolitan Quartet.is as splendidly narrated as its predecessors and seems an almost inevitable consequence of the cold, hard, convention-ridden society of working-class Naples."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great series written by Elena Ferrante"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This last book in my view was not the best of the series of four.

Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay, the third book in the series, was an international best seller and a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. Its author was dubbed \u201cone of the great novelists of our time\u201d by the New York Times Book Review. This fourth and final installment in the series raises the bar even higher and indeed confirms Elena Ferrante as one of the world\u2019s best living storytellers.\r\n \r\nHere is the dazzling saga of two women, the brilliant, bookish Elena and the fiery uncontainable Lila. In this book, both are adults; life\u2019s great discoveries have been made, its vagaries and losses have been suffered. Through it all, the women\u2019s friendship, examined in its every detail over the course of four books, remains the gravitational center of their lives. Both women once fought to escape the neighborhood in which they grew up\u2014a prison of conformity, violence, and inviolable taboos. Elena married, moved to Florence, started a family, and published several well-received books. But now, she has returned to Naples to be with the man she has always loved. Lila, on the other hand, never succeeded in freeing herself from Naples. She has become a successful entrepreneur, but her success draws her into closer proximity with the nepotism, chauvinism, and criminal violence that infect her neighborhood. Yet somehow this proximity to a world she has always rejected only brings her role as unacknowledged leader of that world into relief. For Lila is unstoppable, unmanageable, unforgettable!\r\n \r\nAgainst the backdrop of a Naples that is as seductive as it is perilous and a world undergoing epochal change, this story of a lifelong friendship is told with unmatched honesty. Lila and Elena clash, drift apart, reconcile, and clash again, in the process revealing new facets of their friendship.\r\n \r\nThe four volumes in this series constitute a long remarkable story that readers will return to again and again, and, like Elena and Lila themselves, every return will bring with it new discoveries.", "asin": "1609452860", "rank": "8534", "city": "Naples", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51tssZwPDRL.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
