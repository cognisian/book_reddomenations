Its main character is named Darko, and the setting in modern day Ghana in West Africa.Positives:Well developed charactersInteresting settingHad a very realistic feel.Surprising twists in plot.Helpful glossary in the back of unique Ghanian words.NegativesMain character smokes marijuana a lot.  Smoking in any novel is a huge turn-off to me, so I cannot give this book higher than 4 stars.  I know people in reality smoke, I just do not want to read about it, and prefer books which have characters who do not smoke.Overall my grade is a B"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I couldn't (and I wanted a to) like the main character, nor any of the central characters.

Eager to close the case, the local police have arrested a poor, enamored teenage boy and charged him with murder. Needless to say, they are less than thrilled when an outside force arrives from the big city to lead an inquiry into the baffling case.\r\n\r\nDetective Inspector Darko Dawson, fluent in Ketanu\u2019s indigenous language, is the right man for the job, but he hates the idea of leaving his loving wife and young son, a plucky kid with a defective heart. Pressured by his cantankerous boss, Dawson agrees to travel to Ketanu, sort through the evidence, and tie up the loose ends as quickly and as efficiently as possible. But for Dawson, this sleepy corner of Ghana is rife with emotional land mines: an estranged relationship with the family he left behind twenty-five years earlier and the painful memory of his own mother\u2019s sudden, inexplicable disappearance. \r\n\r\nDawson is armed with remarkable insight and a healthy dose of skepticism, but these gifts, sometimes overshadowed by his mercurial temper, may not be enough to solve this haunting mystery. In Ketanu, he finds that his cosmopolitan sensibilities clash with age-old customs, including a disturbing practice in which teenage girls are offered by their families to fetish priests as trokosi, or Wives of the Gods.\r\n\r\nThis is a compelling and unique mystery, enriched by an exotic setting and a vivid cast. And Inspector Darko Dawson\u2013dedicated family man, rebel in the office, and ace in the field\u2013is one of the most appealing sleuths to come along in years.\r\n\r\n\"Move over Alexander McCall Smith.
