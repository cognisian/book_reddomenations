Would have appreciated a greater focus on intersections of the various European efforts to explore the region or some kind of narrative thru-line. If you thought Anderson's \"Lawrence in Arabia\" was well-done for that region, don't get your hopes up about this book -- it's more of a reference piece."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I have mixed feelings about the book.  I bought this book to read about Caribbean history before visiting some of the islands.  I was hoping for a sense of what brought the islands to where they are today and what underlies their culture.  Unfortunately, the book was not well-suited for that purpose.The Good:  On the one hand, I absolutely commend the author for her knowledge of the topic and her research.  The book is amazingly well researched and the author's knowledge of the topic is impressive.  If you are looking for a vast collection of facts about the different islands, then this book will serve you well.The Bad:  On the other hand, the book lacks a usable narrative format to make the information presented useful.  It comes across a bit like someone listing everything they know rather than someone telling the story of the islands -- it is very linear.  For example, the book outlines the names of leaders and how the demographics of the islands changed (skipping from island to island), but it presents little in the way of what life was like, how the islands functioned politically or culturally, or any of the usual colorful events that make history so interesting.  There are also fascinating tantalizing moments, but the book doesn't exploit them.  For example, it mentions the Founding Fathers of America visiting the islands and getting their gunpowder through the islands, but the book doesn't address this on a personal level nor does it explain how this might have affected the history of the two regions.  This is too bad because I suspect this author has the knowledge to tell a much deeper, richer story than that normally presented in history courses.Again this is not a bad book. It is very informative and quite an impressive feat.  But it is a difficult read which may not provide what you are looking for if you are hoping for insight rather than facts."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great book by a great author."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This book provides a brief history of most of the area in the Carib.  Which is what I was looking for.  Towards the end, history gives way to facts and figures and some opinion - not as interesting, but still worth the read.

One of those books you are at angst to put down."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "As other reviewers have indicated, Empire's Crossroads cover a huge, complex swath of history and geography. Unfortunately, it is generally poorly written and edited. I spotted a number of obvious errors. In fairness, there's a huge amount of material to cover; each chapter should be it's own book. The writing seems to be at a secondary school level with mostly material taken from numerous sources. Extensive research perhaps, but is this enough?It is an easy read, but I feel that there is much more to the stories of each island."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Brilliant! Wonderful read!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Three and a half.  I gave up.  The material is really interesting and there is a lot to learn. For me however the scope was so broad (so many islands and European countries involved) and the time so vast (1492 to present) that I couldn't connect with anything with any depth - just lots and lots of facts about so many things which together give a broad brush of this fascinating area but provide no deep feeling for any particular time or place, leaving it a bit flat for me.  Try sugar in the blood I- that book focuses on the British colonization of Barbados and for me was more relatable."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Such an amazing, entertaining and in depth read on everything that has happened in this important part of our history's world.

In Empire\u2019s Crossroads, British American historian Carrie Gibson traces the story of this coveted area from the northern rim of South America up to Cuba, and from discovery through colonialism to today, offering a vivid, panoramic view of this complex region and its rich, important history.\r\n\r\nAfter that fateful landing in 1492, the British, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Danish, and even the Swedes, Scots, and Germans sought their fortunes in the islands for the next two centuries. Some failed spectacularly: a poorly executed settlement in Panama led the Scots to lose their own independence to England. The Spaniards were the first to find prosperity, in Mexico but also along the islands. In Hispaniola, Cuba, and Puerto Rico, they built grandiose cathedrals and extracted shipfuls of gold and silver, which English, French, and Dutch pirates were happy to seize. But precious metals weren\u2019t a sustainable export\u2014the colonizers needed something that was, and they would need hordes of slaves to cultivate it.\r\n\r\nThe Caribbean\u2019s first cash crop, one indigenous to the New World, was tobacco, and it, along with sugar, spurred expensive new addictions back in Europe. Gibson argues that immaterial exports were just as important. No other region of the world has experienced such a vibrant mixing of cultures, religions, and peoples\u2014Africans, Europeans, Asians, and Amerindians created amazingly dynamic Creole societies that complicated traditional ideas about class and race. By the end of the eighteenth century, seventy thousand free blacks and mulattos lived in the British islands alone, and it was in the Caribbean that the world\u2019s only successful slave revolt took place\u2014sparking the meteoric rise of Napoleon\u2019s black counterpart, Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture, and the Haitian Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Caribbean island of St. Eustatius had been the first to recognize the United States as a nation, but the Americans were soon vying for their own imperial stronghold in the West Indies, attempting to control Cuba and backing influential corporations, most notably United Fruit. In the twentieth century, most of the islands broke from the imperial traditions that had lorded over them for four centuries: this would be the explosive age of decolonization and \u201cbanana republics,\u201d of racial riots and n\u00e9gritude, of Cold War politics and tourist crowds.\r\n\r\nAt every step of her expansive story, Gibson wields fascinating detail to combat the myths that have romanticized this region as one of uniform white sand beaches where the palm trees always sway. Evocatively written and featuring a whole cast of cosmopolitan characters, Empire\u2019s Crossroads reinterprets five centuries of history that have been underappreciated for far too long.", "asin": "0802126146", "rank": "748416", "city": "Cancun", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61sdXCVbHZL.jpg", "country": "Mexico", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
