Her attitudes are what they are. Criticize her views toward slavery and the South (and she offers a thinly-veiled criticism of it).

I was told it was based off the book but I didn't think much of it until I started college and saw that there was a second book that was a sequel to this book. I should have really read this one before it because there were so many differences between the movie and the book, including characters that were never in the movie! Only reason I knocked 1 star is because of that difference; I just can't let it go. Nonetheless, it was a very great read. While different, I really loved how the story was told and it really drew me in. I know the book has its enemies but I see nothing wrong with it, and while not accurate, does explain a part of history. I bought the hard cover which is very nice and printed on thick paper. I'm happy I bought it to with my growing collection of Gone With the Wind."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The world I knew with ALL people respected!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Are you kidding?!?!
