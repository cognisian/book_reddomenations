Some of the dropped names are rather obscure, some more well known, others iconic.This is a memoir as opposed to an autobiography and Vidal helpfully explains the difference within the text of Palimpsest.The material is purportedly a recollection of events occurring in the author's life through the age of 39 (1964).  In fact, there's plenty of commentary concerning events after 1964 all the way up to the time Palimpsest was written in the early to mid 90s.Vidal's acerbic tongue spares few luminaries from the worlds of politics, literature, theater and high society.  Two brief examples.  Evelyn Waugh: \"drunken social climber\", David, Duke of Windsor: \" riveting stupidity\".  By far the recipient of the most vitriol is an alcoholic society matron named Nina who happened to be GV's own mother.  Evidently, the two were at war with each other and ultimately never communicated for the last 20 years of Nina's life.Much attention is given to the Kennedy family.  To say that Vidal did not buy into the Camelot myth would be an understatement.  He depicts Jackie as selfish and money hungry.  He detested Bobby for a number of reasons and Bobby quite apparently returned the favor.Not everything Vidal states as fact is factual.  For example, he asserts that Jackie Kennedy's maternal grandfather, one James Thomas Lee, was in fact Jewish by birth.  If true, this tidbit of information would be a very interesting revelation.  But, alas, a very quick internet search proves this particular claim to be utterly false.Palimpsest is worthy of a 4 star rating.  I learned many things by reading it as would anyone else motivated to make their way through this gossipy Who's Who.  Though, admittedly, some of the revealed inside information would have been better left kept inside."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "READ THIS BOOK.If you're interested in the big view of what happened in 20th century America, Gore Vidal had a singular perspective that spanned more worlds than perhaps any other individual in the century. Palimpsest is him at his witty, vindictive, elegant, catty, erudite, expansive, generous, self-involved finest.  His first-hand perspective on the Kennedy Bros (JFK, RFK), growing up with Jackie O; his complicated friendships with titans of 20th century American art (Bernstein, Nureyev, Kerouac, Tennessee Williams), his vast spite and emnity for others (Capote, Anais Nin), his central involvement in the golden age of American cinema, and his place in the grand experiment of American democracy (first openly gay congressional candidate).And if you don't care about all that, but you want to read a funny, scathing, bitchy (can i say that in an amazon review??) book full of one-line zingers that make you want to chuckle and guffaw and let out a DAYYUM GIRL YOU GOT SCHOOLED, then that's a good enough reason to read this."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Boring assemblage of name-dropping.

I guess I didn't realize that Gore was homosexual at the time.  Now with that knowledge it make more sense.  He does stray off subject to add personal anecdotes.
