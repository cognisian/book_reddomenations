There is so much here that fascinated me despite having read many histories of the period. Her command of detail truly makes this work standout. The events of the war transformed the city of Washington in ways that reflected the concentrated Federal power that was an outgrowth of the conflict.  This is a fine history that tells the story of the War from a different perspective and I found it incredibly engaging and interesting. Once again, the research and detail down to the description of clothing, weather, and other elements makes the reader feel that you are there in the streets of the Capitol witnessing these events yourself.This is well worth the effort for anyone who has an interest in the era."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The city of Washington becomes the main character during a perilous time.  Through the Civil War period a bizarre group of people inhabited the city and also saints of our nation's history gave their very lives to preserve the noblest ideals.  Margaret Leech's writing will enhance the literacy of the most learned by the most discerning use of language.  While not a fast read, it is a very memorable one.Gary Putnam"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Totally amazing read!!!  What a revealing story of D.C. during the Civil War days.

A must read for any person who is a student of history."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Each day since the surrender in Appomattox on April 9, 1865 has supposedly seen the publication of a book about the American Civil War. After a century and a half of titles, it's easy to get lost in the catalog. However, Reveille in Washington by Margaret Leech is a classic that should be on every Civil War aficionado's short list. It's a fascinating historical account of Washington DC during the conflict. It's tight writing with elegant turns of phrase. It's very well-researched. It's stood the test of time.

Soldiers of a volunteer army swing from the dome of the Capitol, assassins stalk the avenues, and Abraham Lincoln struggles to justify his presidency as the Union heads to war. \r\n \r\nReveille in Washington focuses on the everyday politics and preoccupations of Washington during the Civil War. From the stench of corpse-littered streets to the plunging lace on Mary Lincoln\u2019s evening gowns, Margaret Leech illuminates the city and its familiar figures\u2014among them Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, William Seward, and Mary Surratt\u2014in intimate and fascinating detail. \r\n   \r\nLeech\u2019s book remains widely recognized as both an impressive feat of scholarship and an uncommonly engrossing work of history.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn 1860, Washington was a raw country town, a symbol trying to be a city. By 1865 it had become the nation\u2019s capital. Reveille in Washington is packed and running over with the anecdotes, scandals, personalities, and tragi-comedies of the day. Here you will meet young Andy Carnegie organizing military transport; a Patent Office clerk named Clara Barton suddenly discovering she has a real vocation; Matthew Brady, obsessed with the idea that he could make a photographic record of a war; Louisa M. Alcott and Walt Whitman finding their great moments in hospitals. It\u2019s a wonderful story.\u201d The New Yorker", "asin": "1590174461", "rank": "762742", "city": "Washington D.C.", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/513ENPTn9hL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
