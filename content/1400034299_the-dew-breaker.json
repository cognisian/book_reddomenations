Edwidge Danticat is famous for many works: Breath, Eyes, Memory, an Oprah book club selection; Krik? Krak!, a National Book Award finalist; and The Farming of Bones, an American Book Award winner. The Dew Breaker is similar to her other novels, like Breath, Eyes, Memory, as they focus a lot on Haiti in general. The Dew Breaker is also similar to a Thousand Splendid Suns, as it is split into multiple parts with no explicit explanation as to how these parts are connected. This fiction novel is comprised of 9 short stories that connect loosely to one another. The overlaying commonality is about a man, his wife, and the journey of their daughter, Ka, learning about her father\u2019s past. The plot is well thought-out, original, and unpredictable. It is interesting as it causes you to read in between the lines and connect the stories by piecing together information by yourself. The story is authentic and relates to geography as there are details about escaping to New York from other countries, a connection to U.S. history of Ellis Island being an extremely busy immigration inspection station up until 1954, and Italians living in basements to avoid being caught. The characters are also well-developed and relatable as Ka and her father are mentally lost and confused at times (like most). Ka also struggles internally with keeping calm and not acting on impulses. This is shown in a scene where she mistakes a man for someone he is not and almost confronts him. Ka also experiences other inner struggles of not knowing what to do with the newfound information she is receiving throughout the novel. Readers should be aware of potential things of controversy on the topics of religion, judgmentalism of others, and morals in The Dew Breaker. The theme I have found within this novel is forgetting the past, looking toward the future, and accepting the world around you. A moral that readers will discover is that all is not as it may seem in life and there are many truths to still be uncovered. I would recommend this novel to mature readers that like to think and analyze text. Women and men would both benefit and enjoy from reading as it takes the perspective of both in mind and also causes you to ponder about how other genders may interpret the thoughts of the characters. The Dew Breaker is a memorable book due to the different accounts taken throughout the novel and how you must use investigative skills to fully comprehend the text."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This seller was fast with shipping!
