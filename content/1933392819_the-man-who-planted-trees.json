He continues in the face of bureaucratic indifference. His groves restore a barren corner of France. The shade restores streams and soil. People notice. Farmers return, villages flourish.This well-known French fable has inspired green belt movements everywhere, from the arid Sahel in Africa, to the dust bowls of the United States. This is a short story, taking only an hour to read. The edition I read is beautifully illustrated with wood engravings. It contains a Foreword from Angari Maathai, 2004 Nobel Prize winner for her green belt work in Kenya; and an Afterword from Andy Lipkis, founder of Tree People in the Los Angeles area. An extensive reference list of groups that promote tree planting is included at the end.Read more at bookmanreader.blogspot.com ."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "A parable in the form of a sweet, simple novella, in which a hermit shepherd spends years planting hundreds of thousands of tree seeds, in the process rejuvenating an entire ecosystem."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Am sending it to my son to read to HIS sons for Fathers' Day."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Fascinating."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "TY.

Written in the 1950s, its message was ahead of its time, inspiring readers to rediscover the harmonies of the countryside and prevent its wilful destruction.\r\n\r\nThe narrator, journeying by foot across the barren plains of the lower Alps, has his thirst assuaged by the well water drawn by the shepherd Elz\u00e9ard Bouffier. Here begins the subtle parable which Giono weaves of the life-giving shepherd who chooses to live alone and carry out the work of God. Over forty years the desolate hills and lifeless villages which so oppressed the traveller are transformed by the dedication of one man. All with the help of a few acorns. \r\n\r\nGiono's hope was to set in motion a worldwide reforestation programme that would rejuvenate the earth. The Man who Planted Trees is a hymn to creation and a purveyor of confidence in man's ability to change his \u2013 indeed the world's \u2013 lot.\r\n\r\n\"In Giono's work what every sensitive, full-blooded individual ought to be able to recognize at once is 'the song of the world.'\"Henry Miller\r\n", "asin": "1933392819", "rank": "145848", "city": "Provence", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51aj43xJVvL.jpg", "country": "FR", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
