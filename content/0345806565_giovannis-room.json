And it is easily one of the best stories I've ever read. And it was really relatable, that internal struggle of wanting to live your life but grappling with the fact that it's not what other people deem acceptable whether it's society or your own family.  Beautifully written."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The writing is so good that I found myself occasionally pausing and wondering just how James Baldwin constructed such beautiful sentences. He has a unique style with a unique way of sentence structure that took a VERY brief moment to get into, but once I did I found the text flowing beautifully as if I was on a literary boat ride moving up and down with the swells. There was a lot of pathos in the story and the characters were fully fleshed out. It is remarkable that this book was written in the early fifties. The description on the back of the book is slightly misleading in that it is not really a love triangle (that phrase is not stated, but implied) as much as a story about two men, one of which has a not present fiancee who is only tangentially important to the story. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who appreciates beautifully written, well thought out plots with engaging characters."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Beautifully written little story which holds little back.
