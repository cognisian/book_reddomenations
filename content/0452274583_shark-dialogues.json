Bought to read while on vacation in Hawaii.  Didn't realize what a pain in the butt haoies are to the wonderful people of Hawaii.  Left Maui much more respectful.  Ordered Davenport's Song of the Exile because I loved this book so much.  Surprisingly.she incorporated some of the characters from this book.  But over-all her second book was not the sweeping saga that I expected.  Will be re-reading Shark Dialogues soon because there is so much poetry in the writing, I'm sure I missed a lot of it as I raced through this book to see what would happen next."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I gave it a 4 star because it kept my interest and I didn't want to put down.

It is very well-written and is probably one of the best books on Hawaii that shows so much heart.  Having lived in Hawaii for four years and loving every moment of my time there, I am heartbroken to know even more about the rape of the islands by whites.  I have read all of Davenport's books, and highly recommend them to anyone interested in that wonderful state."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The history of Hawaii is well worth the read of the first part of the book and it is sprinkled throughout the rest of the story. I thought it was a good story that should have been half as long. She needed to let up a bit on the the constant longing for Pono to love them, what her secret, was, and Pono's aloofness. It is the Hawaiian version of Clan of the Cave Bear."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I had read this book as a teenager and it stayed in my mind: Strong women who take to the sea to heal when things get tough.

Multiple levels:  history of Hawaii, Japanese influence and drug culture there, US pineapple industry affects, Polynesian culture, and history of Maliki and the leper colony and the effects leprosy had on families.

And at its center are Pono, the magnificent pure-blooded matriarch and seer, and her four mixed-blood granddaughters seeking to come to terms with the contradictions of their ancestries and the hungers of their hearts. \r\n\r\nTheir loves, their hates, the bonds joining them, and the furies possessing them are interwoven with ancient legends and lore of the islands whose past offers their salvation and whose future is their fate. \r\n\r\nKiana Davenport has written a major contribution to the literature of the Pacific Rim\u2014a great reading experience both brilliantly contemporary in its form and timeless in its illumination.\r\n \r\n\u201cA giant, image-fevered, luxuriant saga of a Hawaiian family\u2026 powerful, memorable, intoxicating.\u201d\u2014Kirkus Reviews", "asin": "0452274583", "rank": "215679", "city": "Honolulu", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZjfjiPY3L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
