Yet it is also a book where he takes his time, his descriptions are detailed and nothing is rushed.  Fallada wanted to make sure his readers got the whole story and were able to soak up the reality of life in Nazi controlled Berlin, in all its frightening details.  It is the contrast between the small handful of individuals, determined to challenge Nazi accounts of the war in the smallest, but most immediate way they can think of to get around blanket control versus the weight of the Nazi state marshalled against them that will remain in this reader's mind for a long, long time.  Small, indeed petty really, as their contribution of handwritten protest postcards was, it took enormous courage and the couple saw it through to the end, with dignity and courage.  Good people brave enough to confront a totalitarian system, enforced by petty criminals and thugs.  Yet many were prepared to give their lives to challenge the regime of terror and they should never be forgotten."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Anna and Otto Quangel lost their only son when Germany invaded France in WWII. They did not wish to sit by without resisting the increasingly barbaric nazi policies, so they devised a form of quiet resistance, which simply entailed printing postcards critical of their regime, and leaving them in busy places. The danger they exposed themselves and everyone who came into contact with them to was severe. They and Ma y people were executed because of this simple form of protest. I always knew about secret informers who could betray even their parents landing them in concentration camps, for saying, or even implying the slightest criticism of naziiasm, but I never before read a book that made me feel abjest fear every time the Quangels went to place one of their cards. This novel was inspired by a true story."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book is cutting. It is filled with muscular prose and the story and its hero and heroine are painted as simple people who have everyday dreams that we all have. I cannot say enough about this book, which I know that I will re-read. Spectacular."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "... the banality of good ...Hans Fallada\u2019s novel, \u2018Jeder stirbt f\u00fcr sich allein\u2019 (Everyone dies alone,) first came to my attention through its publication in English, \u2018Alone in Berlin,\u2019 a translation that was delayed by 60 years. The book has been sitting on my shelf as a \u2018must read\u2019 for a long while. Burdened by regressive small-mindedness and divisions around the world, I finally tackled \u2018Alone in Berlin,\u2019 aware that it would be a grim read, having been described as a testament to the darkest years of the 20th century from the point of view and experience of ordinary people.Resistance to the Nazi regime by individuals had no news value after the war. Yet such stories provide the most poignant insights into what it is like to oppose a state under a dictatorship. As such, this book, written raw and in haste eighteen month after the defeat of Nazism, offers a high alert to simple solutions for social problems. The author, Hans Fallada, aka Rudolf Ditzen, died before this last of his works was published in 1947.The urgency behind the writing is palpable. The players, sketched with harsh strokes, embody the full range of human nature \u2013 the capacity for compassion, kindness, complacency, stupidity, meanness, stubbornness, false pride, envy, hate, and resentment, fear, fanaticism and vengeance tipping into the most depraved cruelty.Very quickly the dread of being caught in the nightmarish system of a totalitarian state jumps at the reader. While the ghostly despot drifts in the background, his control is shown through the dynamic interactions of ordinary citizens \u2013 be they power-hungry officers, opportunists, cunning manipulators, cowards, reticent objectors or unsung heroes. Resistance carried the threat of death and seemed futile.The anguish conveyed is chilling, intensified by the archetypal hue clinging to the tragic comic characters, at times suggesting caricatures. The sheer absurdness of the stupidities and sadistic cruelties depicted may dilute the shock, but it makes the scenes all the more heart-breaking.The classic method of totalitarianism is to instil fear and divide factions of society against each other, so people spy on each other and nobody can be trusted anymore. In this chapter of history fear served as the leverage for forcing the banal idea of a perfect state that can be safeguarded through clockwork control.Fallada\u2019s main protagonists, Otto and Anna Quangel, were based on the records of two insignificant objectors to the regime, Otto and Elise Hampel. The elderly couple started spreading anti-Nazi missives written on postcards in buildings around Berlin. For their sadly ineffective attempts of rebellion, the Hampel\u2019s were arrested in 1942, tried in 1943 and executed shortly after. The same fate befell their friends and relatives.Can a few virtuous individuals, each driven by personal idiosyncrasies, redeem the moral integrity of a nation? It is up to the reader to decide whether the many deaths a totalitarian regime inflicts on soon forgotten brave people are in vain.The book brought alive the pressure my grandparents must have lived under, as well as the uncanny anxious atmosphere that spoiled my parents\u2019 teen years, and, the wariness I personally and many of the post-war generation developed towards overbearing authority.Presented in the context of ordinary individual lives, the story reads like a tragic comedy that screams \u2013 let us never forget that freedom lies in people being allowed to be different, not chained to a hell of obedience and conformity.Primo Levi\u2019s declared \u2018Alone in Berlin\u2019 as the greatest book ever written about German resistance to the Nazis. English readers have had to wait 60 years to read the novel."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "An authentic tale of what opportunism and complaisance contributed to the stranglehold Fascism gained during these years. Yet, also a redemptive tale, with people laying down their lives symbolically to show their refusal to accept the horrors of barbaric Europe and its worst inhabitants of the time  Can't say I was encouraged, but certainly spellbound and left wondering where my own chahracter would dovetail in times and places like those.
