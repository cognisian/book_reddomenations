Because of the description of Frog Music, I thought it would lend itself to the perfect audio read\u2013an interesting story, with music and songs. Those types of books generally sound better than read on the page, so I downloaded it from the library and settled in to my bed nest for a listen.I wasn\u2019t wrong\u2013this definitely was meant to be heard rather than read on the page. The reader had great vocal presence, did a great job with the many accents\u2013French, old timey Western. She had a decent singing voice even in those accents for the little diddies that went along with the story.Unfortunately, I had a very hard time connecting with the characters. The only one I was remotely interested in, Jenny, dies a few chapters in (not a spoiler, it\u2019s in the blurb). The rest seemed flat and secondary. Even Blanche just didn\u2019t have any appeal to me.But I might have at least continued the book, just to find out what happened, even after I was well\u2013if it weren\u2019t for the blatant racism throughout. The book is set in San Francisco in the late 1800s, and there is a hard focus on Asian families who migrated to America during that period of time. They were referred to with slurs and terrible discrimination throughout the first half of the book\u2013blamed for the sickness that was running through the city, and looked down upon for their supposed filthy ways of living and lack of Westernization. There was no point to it\u2013it wasn\u2019t related to the plot at all, more of a general setting or city description\u2013and therefore it went unchallenged. The more pieces like that came up, the more sick I felt, and the less I wanted to continue. I\u2019d love someone to tell me that later in the book it is challenged, that it gets better\u2026but I was too turned off by it to finish the book."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Strange book. You really want it to be good and it keeps trying but fails. So much potential but bad execution."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Implausible, jumped around chronologically and difficult to follow, sex scenes crude, neither erotic nor \"violent.\"  My wife bought it and I read it.  Big mistake.  Waited for resolution and there was none.  Worst book I've read in years.  Most of my reviews are four or five stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The characters in the book were very interesting and well-developed. She captured the feelings of her characters and of that time period in history.. Having one of the main characters capture frogs for a living was certainly a creative twist. Jenny  would have been a perfect fit in our Hippie Culture. Her killer was a surprise to me. My main criticism was that at times it was confusing  because of the way that the author jumped back and forth in the time periods."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "This book should not be classified as historical fiction, but as porn.

I really hated the way it shifted in time, telling part for the ending near the beginning and back and forth, back and forth - really unnecessary, as though the author thought the story itself was not good enough to be captivating without revealing the dramatic outcomes early on. I also didn't care for the present narration. Is this a literary technique to make me think it happening right now? I know the story was set in the past. Is not enhanced by this device."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I actually really enjoyed this one. It took me a long time to really get interested in the characters, but I fell in love with the world-building almost immediately. I felt like I was actually in San Francisco in the mid 1870s. Like I could feel the cloying heat and fear of the smallpox outbreak. And I attribute everything I loved about this book to the amazing narration by Khristine Hvam.

Through the window of a railroad saloon, a young woman named Jenny Bonnet is shot dead.\r\n\r\nThe survivor, her friend Blanche Beunon, is a French burlesque dancer. Over the next three days, she will risk everything to bring Jenny's murderer to justice--if he doesn't track her down first. The story Blanche struggles to piece together is one of free-love bohemians, desperate paupers, and arrogant millionaires; of jealous men, icy women, and damaged children. It's the secret life of Jenny herself, a notorious character who breaks the law every morning by getting dressed: a charmer as slippery as the frogs she hunts.\r\n\r\nIn thrilling, cinematic style, FROG MUSIC digs up a long-forgotten, never-solved crime. Full of songs that migrated across the world, Emma Donoghue's lyrical tale of love and bloodshed among lowlifes captures the pulse of a boomtown like no other.", "asin": "0316324671", "rank": "131950", "city": "San Francisco", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512r50%2Bi5eL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
