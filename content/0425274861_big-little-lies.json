I really liked the small fragments of conversation at the bottom of each chapter.\u00a0The books twists and turns make you not want to put it down. It is easy to read and therefore it is easy for you to immerse yourself in the setting Moriarty creates for the reader.\u00a0The characters in the book are written so well that the comparison of the glamorous Celeste and Madeline compared to plain Jane. Although they are glamorous the author humanizes them by giving them problems that are real and relatable. Sometimes the names of the characters gets overwhelming when trying to remember who does what in this little town, but then there's little reminders to refresh you.\u00a0I would recommend buying this for your favorite reader."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.

The series is set in Monterey, but the book was set in Sydney, Australia. \r\n \r\nSometimes it\u2019s the little lies that turn out to be the most lethal...A murder\u2026a tragic accident\u2026or just parents behaving badly? What\u2019s indisputable is that someone is dead. But who did what? \r\n\r\nBig Little Lies follows three women, each at a crossroads:\r\n\r\nMadeline is a force to be reckoned with. She\u2019s funny and biting, passionate, she remembers everything and forgives no one. Her ex-husband and his yogi new wife have moved into her beloved beachside community, and their daughter is in the same kindergarten class as Madeline\u2019s youngest (how is this possible?). And to top it all off, Madeline\u2019s teenage daughter seems to be choosing Madeline\u2019s ex-husband over her. (How. Is. This. Possible?).\r\n\r\nCeleste is the kind of beautiful woman who makes the world stop and stare. While she may seem a bit flustered at times, who wouldn\u2019t be, with those rambunctious twin boys? Now that the boys are starting school, Celeste and her husband look set to become the king and queen of the school parent body. But royalty often comes at a price, and Celeste is grappling with how much more she is willing to pay.\r\n\r\nNew to town, single mom Jane is so young that another mother mistakes her for the nanny. Jane is sad beyond her years and harbors secret doubts about her son. But why? While Madeline and Celeste soon take Jane under their wing, none of them realizes how the arrival of Jane and her inscrutable little boy will affect them all.\r\n\r\nBig Little Lies is a brilliant take on ex-husbands and second wives, mothers and daughters, schoolyard scandal, and the dangerous little lies we tell ourselves just to survive.\r\n\r\n\u201cMs. Moriarty\u2019s long-parched fans have something new to dig into\u2026Big Little Lies [may have] even more staying power than The Husband\u2019s Secret.\u201d The New York Times\r\n", "asin": "0425274861", "rank": "1178", "city": "Sydney", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51raEVV%2BzrL.jpg", "country": "Australia", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
