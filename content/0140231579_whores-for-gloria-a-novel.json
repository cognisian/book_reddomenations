It was less complex in it's characterizations but still a decent read and easy to follow. There are times when you wonder just what in the world is the aim of the protagonist who ultimately pays a considerable price for his bizarre obsessions and his delusional living but I won't give too much away here. Another dystopian yarn from Vollmann, meant perhaps for fans only."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Appearing in 1991, this short novel conveys some of the stories Vollmann gathered during his time among the San Francisco Tenderloin, pre-gentrification, around Jones Street. While a familiar topic for this author, and one which his readers will have learned much about given his many stories set in this milieu, this is his first attempt to make a longer work out of episodes. He alludes in the preface that these are true, as told to him by prostitutes, within the fictional framework, typical of Vollmann's blending in much of his books, between fiction and fact.The grittiness is there. You see via Jimmy, a Vietnam vet on disability living in a claptrap hotel, the lesions and bruises on those with whom he mingles, and while he's out for sex, he's also in search of the titular Gloria. Almost like a sister to him as they grew up, he longs for her and whether he makes up these stories for an imaginary character or a real woman he's loved and lost, this impels him to keep paying for sex and for stories from those around him.This reminded me of Holden in \"The Catcher in the Rye,\" and like that novel, this method Vollmann favors does risk familiarity and sentimentality among the proverbial subjects with hearts of gold. They are tarnished and tawdry here, but Vollmann makes the effort and forces us to take the time to hear their tales from past and present, and we see them as fellow human beings. This intention, the ethical motive underlying his career before and especially since this early novel, keeps him readable even when the material, as here for me, is not what I'd gravitate towards, compared to his historical and political themes in his later books (which I've been reading the past few years with pleasure, gradually reviewing here...).\"The light was very red and warm; the girls were beautiful, and everything was beautiful until later when the girls got anxious and started demanding their tips.\" That sums up the mood. He and his pal Code Six, also a vet, watch coverage of the past war, with the sound off to block flashbacks for his friend. \"The long lean bombs went swimming slowly downward like fish, until they came to the towns and became orange flowers.\" Not much happens. Jimmy is going downhill, the city draws him down, and everyone's on the make--as the opening vignette with Laredo, who's undercover, introduces efficiently.His downcast mood permeates this novel. \"He knew life was going to get worse. Maybe stories weren't enough, he thought. But no, they 'have' to be. Stories and hair.\" He collects both, the latter to make some sort of snipped tribute to the elusive Gloria. This all lacks resolution, and stops suddenly, as if to jar the reader out of a stupor shared by Jimmy and those who surround him. It's a low-key narration, but Vollmann captures the feel of the down and out with his typical mix of detachment and compassion."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Whores for Gloria, like its author, takes time to grow on you. Vollman's writing style takes some getting used to, but once you read for a little while, you'll realize just how tight his prose is. His exploration of Jimmy's consciousness is haunting, and the way he rehashes the prostitute's stories and changes them to be about himself is interesting.Another things that is interesting about this book is the ambiguity of Gloria's identity. Gloria is a woman, seemingly a prostitute that Jimmy claims to be married to. He thinks that by collecting stories and hair from other prostitutes he can somehow reconstruct her. The question is whether or not Gloria exists. I came to my own conclusions on that, and I'll let you do the same.I liked that, at the end of the novella, Vollman included an actual account of his experiences with prostitutes, including a diagram of the average street prices for anything you could think of, as of the early 90's.My only complaint about the book is that I wish it had gone more into Jimmy's consciousness. Despite that, it is a good way to introduce yourself to the author, simply because of how short it is.This book is written in a way that reminds me A LOT of Zombie by Joyce Carol Oates, which explores the mind of a psychotic serial killer. I recommend reading that if you like this book, or the other way around."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "William T. Vollmann, Whores for Gloria (Pantheon, 1991)Published just as Vollmann was beginning to make a name for himself as a critical darling, Whores for Gloria propelled him into the world of underground literature with a fervor rarely seen. What separates the now-towering Vollmann from his flash-in-the-pan contemporaries is that Vollmann's shock-value work actually has some real meat to it.Whores for Gloria is the story of Jimmy, a drunkard who lives in San Francisco's Tenderloin district and pines for Gloria. We have no idea who Gloria really is, and we often get the idea that Jimmy doesn't, either. In an effort to rebuild his memories of Gloria in his mind, Jimmy begins paying the area's hookers to tell him stories of their childhoods, which Jimmy then maps onto himself and Gloria, attempting to make her (or his vision of her) achieve flesh-and-blood status.As the title is likely to convey, Whores for Gloria is not a suitable-for-all-audiences kind of book. However, one isn't going to get the prurient-interest-for-the-sake-of-prurient-interest writing one finds in such authors as Dennis Cooper or Matthew Stokoe; what Vollmann has penned here is a surprisingly subtle mystery novel disguised as a slice-of-life drama so embraced by the other authors mentioned above. The best comparison I can make to this book is to the better novels of Joyce Carol Oates; it seems to me that those who enjoy Oates' take on the disintegration of the psyche will also get a kick out of Vollmann. This one deserves the hype. *** \u00bd"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I've read that Vollman is the next great American novelist and you can certainly compare him to Pynchon.  I wouldn't go quite so far as that, but he certainly has an evocative, if sometimes difficult to follow prose style, that one will either find very annoying or very gratifying, depending how well you get into his groove.This novel or novella is quite good. Vollman depicts a very gritty, grimy, and sometimes gross Tenderloin district in San Francisco known for it's prostitutes, strip clubs, and other nefarious goings on.  The story is about Jimmy, a low life, down and out, alcoholic who is in love with a prostitute named Gloria.  The catch is Jimmy is so addled by the end of the novel we never really know whether Gloria is real or a figment of Jimmy's imagination.  In some ways Gloria is an amalgamation of a number of street girls that Jimmy congregates with.  Whatever the case, the story is compelling - the way watching a train wreck is compelling."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of the editorial reviews calls this a \"minor\" work and I can see his point; it's a novella with small ambitions and it's defintely tawdry. (For me, that's a plus, having a weakness for that sort of thing.) However, that's not the reason I've read it dozens of times, and will continue rereading it. There's the description of the Tenderloin, which is lean and evocative; Vollman brings it to life the way Jimmy wants the whores' stories to revive Gloria. There's the compassion I have for Jimmy, who is the sort of stinking, addled drunk you'd walk by while holding your breath. But most of all - and I have no idea if it was intended - \"Whores for Gloria\" becomes this wonderful allegory for the process of writing a novel, if not being a novelist. Jimmy is so deluded that he goes to whores in search of their hair and their stories and their memories, all of which he thinks he can graft on to his memory (invented or not) of Gloria and make her real. It's the same game a novelist plays: there's an ideal vision that exists for reasons only he/she understands. To make it real on paper they have to become an obsessive collector of the world, stealing others' stories and blending them with their own imaginations. Such a strange, crazy-making hobby - and yet every novelist on Amazon.com has indulged in it, which is one more reason that Jimmy becomes a worthy subject. A terrific read(...)"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Jimmy spends his social security checks on booze andprostitutes, whose stories become more important than theirfavors. Minimal, nervous and often funny. What the reader actually see of Jimmy 's life is like a wrinkled piece of saran wrap, stretched over a bowl of something slimey, churning,and threatening to overflow; as, almost against your will, Vollmann's elegant spellbinding prose pulls you closer and closer. Beware --this isn't for everyone. It's impolite, gross, nasty, violent.
