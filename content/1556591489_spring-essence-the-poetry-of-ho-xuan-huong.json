I couldn't find ANY other translations of her magnificent poetry.  The GOOD:  One needs to read the introduction, which is well written, to get some idea of the complexity of writing in Nom , speakingin polytonal Vietnamese and then trying to compress symphonic poetry into a monotone language.  Huong was an ingenious genius andat least here we get a faraway glimpse to her flights.  Yes, an immensity gets lost in translation, here more so than many others, still evenviewing shadows is better than never opening one's eyes.  What could have been improved:  The footnotes are at the End of the book, and since they do NEED to be read, to fully appreciate the poems,it would have been simpler and easier for the reader, if they were at the bottom of each poem.  He often talks about double meanings, butthen becomes prudish and evasive about what precisely they mean.  Inquiring poetry readers would like to know.  The Bad....THE COVER!  Ho Xuan Huong was an outspoken woman, who railed against conventions and conveniences.  To depict a womenwith her bare breasts exposed and her FACE COVERED, that's American spin, not at all in the 'ESSENCE' of her blossomingSPRING poetry- a tag line on the back says, \"Funding the publication of exceptional literary works\"....AGREED this is exceptional, so HOWABOUT an Exceptionally Appropriate COVER!  She wrote openly about sexuality, but it'd would be more in keeping with her poetry, to show a Vietnamese woman (including exposing her FACE) in the spring countryside of Vietnam...."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very beautiful, but so much was lost in translation and over time."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "These works are not produced by one person.

I read this volume the first timeoutside on a windy day in autumn and found the verse quite charming.  When I re-read it again this winter I didn't enjoy it quite so much.

Translator John Balaban successfully brings her works to light for English readers in this 150-page collection of her poems.  It is a treasure to encounter for the nascent student of Asian poetry.As a concubine Ho Xuan Hu'o'ng was able to bravely and cleverly 'expose' her clients and write visceral, risqu\u00e9 poems that served as her own means of speaking out against what she saw as social, political and religious disintegration.  She could, in fact, be considered one of the first feminists, so shrewd were her attacks on male authority as only a concubine could gain insight.  But it is not just the ideas behind her words that make the difference: her poems are beautifully constructed and elegant, as in 'Confession':  Her lonely boat fated to float aimlessly  midstream, weary with sadness, drifting.  Her hold overflowing with duty and feeling,  bow rocked by storms, adrift and wandering.  She rows on, not caring who tries to dock,  sails on, not caring who tries the rapids.  Whoever comes on board is pleased  as she plucks her guitar, sad and drifting.As we become more aware of the cultural gifts of Vietnam it is a joy to encounter the poetry of Ho Xuan Hu'o'ng.  Grady Harp, November 06"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "These poems by the 18th century Vietnamese poet Ho Xuan Huong (whose name means \"Spring Essence\") as translated into English by the poet John Balaban are truly delightful.  The poems poke fun at self-satisfied government officials,  intellectuals--men in general--with good-humored irreverence.  \"Young Scholars,\" picturing students who \"can't even talk,\" suggests that \"Someone. . . teach these fools/ to take their brushes and paint the pagoda walls.\" With the voice of a concubine who knows her clientele intimately, HXH writes of the \"male member\":  \"Newborn, it wasn't so vile.  But now, at night,/ even blind it flares brigher than any lamp.\" Clearly, this poet is courageous, attacking convention at a time when few Vietnamese women even knew how to write.  She does not reserve her wit for men alone, but accuses women of being weak-minded as well, as in this line from a poem offering \"consolation\" to a young widow:  \"If you've got weak blood, don't eat rich food.\"As any attentive reader can see in the versions of the poems printed in modern Vietnamese, HXH utilizes rhyming forms.  Balaban's translations pay homage to the forms by attending to rhyme and sound without being bound by strict rhyme. The near-rhymes in this couplet from a poem on cats offers a good example of the sound-play Balaban engages in : \"their only thought is to pounce on a mouse/ then croon from rooftops arousing meows.\" (The poem, in Huong's clever use of double-entendre, also suggests more than it says).  Despite the sometimes rough subject matter, this is an elegant book.John Balaban and his publisher, Copper Canyon Press, deserve a lot of credit for bringing the poems of Ho Xuan Huong to a contemporary audience in three versions--the original ideographic Nom script, the modern, Romanized Vietnamese equivalent, and Balaban's lyrical English versions."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "As a Vietnamese who has some background in the Vietnamese language and literature, I am amazed by poet John Balaban\ufffds keen interest in my language and its poetry as well as his poetic skills through his well-known and well-loved translation of Ho Xuan Huong\ufffds poetry entitled Spring Essence.Balaban skillfully brings to life the three-century old Vietnamese female poet to the Western world.
