All I can really say is that this book is beautiful.  It is tragic without ever being cliche.  The text is almost poetic.  It has a compelling plot but retains philosophical profundity.

I read anything else but Death And The Dervish and Ivo Andri\u0107. Until I \"discovered\" America. God, why everything happens here? It is where I read The Dervish for the first time - in English.
