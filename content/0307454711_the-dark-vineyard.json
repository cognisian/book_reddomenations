Reading on and into the community  in this one is a delight-- there are some awkward moments and a few plot gaps, and some francophilia, but certain pages will be read aloud for their perfect capture of the moment.  The description that connections national identity of the Brits and the Irish to the style of rugby play delighted us all (until we got to the French bit I mentioned).  The food, the traditions, and the meting of justice all make for a good read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent plot and complex situations leading to end"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A wonderful read, combined with the cuisine and beauty of the French countryside.
