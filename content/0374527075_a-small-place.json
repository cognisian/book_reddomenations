It is filled with contempt for people who have been unable to leave Antigua as Ms. Kincaid has been fortunate to do.  Descriptions of tourists are putty colored lumps and such make me think racism is not one-directional.  No where is there any sense of trying to affect positive change.  Her writing does have style, but this basically reminds me of work hailed in the early seventies as \"daring\" and \"insightful\" when it is all shinola."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Not the best of Jamaica Kinkaid books. It is very short, I read the entire book in half an hour. All it is basically her own thoughts about the island of Antigua. She has some other novels that I loved, but this is not one of them. It's just basically her talking about how foreigners think of Antigua as paradise, but for people who grew up there, it is not so great. There are no jobs, no places to get health care, and the schools were lacking everything. Basically stuff everyone already knows."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The book was great"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Kincaid offers an honest and more complete view of Antigua than most people are willing to admit.
