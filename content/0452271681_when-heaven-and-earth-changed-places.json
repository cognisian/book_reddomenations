Do you want to know how brutal this war was?  Do you want to know the good and the bad from the point of view of a Viet Cong family?  Do you want to see the travesty of what war does to a young child selling her body or dating American soldiers?  How about a revisit years later after living in the USA and exploring the differences in the family based upon where they live and the government they live under?This book is so good on so many levels and I could not recommend it higher to learn, although I acknowledge at times it is a little slow.  But what a story it tells!  I would also note there is a movie based upon this book that I hope to see to complete my knowledge on this war from the perspective of the Vietnamese.Buy this book to learn of why the USA should not fight limited wars.

Being  a Viet Cong spy and villager herself Ms Hayslip reveals the mindset of a people we could not hope to understand even if we served ten tours. Taught from birth the ideals of the importance of Mother Earth, ancestral accomplishments and sacrifices and village life and tradition, coupled with over one hundred years of oppression perpetrated by colonial masters, the Vietnamese people could do none else but support those who promised cultural freedom and self governance. As a Vietnam War Veteran my struggles with many issues have been reconciled by this frank account of what it was really all about. Thank You, Ms Hayslip.Sgt. Dale V. GriggsVietnam, 1969-1972"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The book is well written, introspective and gentle in its characterization of Yankees, village people, family members and soldiers, despite their bad behavior.  Le Ly Hayslip lived in the South, near DaNang, but her family included brothers who fought for both the North and the South.  Her village was divided in its loyalties and there was inevitable spying and reporting on each other.Le Ly portrays her village social harmony before the war and how it disappeared during the conflict.  She describes her parents' behavior and reaction to the extreme danger and turmoil of the times.  She describes her village in loving terms without being overly sentimental.  There are many scenes of high adventure as she tries to navigate safely within a powder-keg environment.  There are other scenes with parents, siblings, friends that seek to make sense out of the senseless, choices when no good ones are available.She discusses the behavior of American GIs, including her involvement with them.  The reader can begin to understand the predicament of young Vietnamese women and their social entrapment.  The case studies of several American soldiers is not flattering, but their behavior is portrayed in a straight-forward manner and it is allowed to speak for itself.When Heaven and Earth Changed Places explains a very complicated situation and underlying reasons that American soldiers couldn't recognize the enemy and their methods couldn't match the commitment of the North Vietnamese.  It shows how technological advantage and superior gun powder can't overcome one's love of home and the need to defend it.Le Ly fled to the States and then returned to reunite with her family twenty years later.  Her mother is still alive and her siblings rise to the occasion in  unpredictable ways.  But there's a kind of completion, a unity of spirit, despite the loss of tradition, ancestors, the father and the mutuality of village life.  This book neither resolves nor concludes, but it gives hope we can survive, and even thrive, when we proceed with our best intentions."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Forty years after the Vietnam War ended, this is still, current, fresh and vibrant.

When Heaven and Earth Changed Places is the haunting memoir of a girl on the verge of womanhood in a world turned upside down. The youngest of six children in a close-knit Buddhist family, Le Ly Hayslip was twelve years old when U.S. helicopters langed in Ky La, her tiny village in central Vietnam. As the government and Viet Cong troops fought in and around Ky La, both sides recruited children as spies and saboteurs. Le Ly was one of those children.\r\n\r\nBefore the age of sixteen, Le Ly had suffered near-starvation, imprisonment, torture, rape, and the deaths of beloved family members\u2014but miraculously held fast to her faith in humanity. And almost twenty years after her escape to America, she was drawn inexorably back to the devastated country and family she left behind. Scenes of this joyous reunion are interwoven with the brutal war years, offering a poignant picture of Vietnam, then and now, and of a courageous woman who experienced the true horror of the Vietnam War\u2014and survived to tell her unforgettable story.\r\n\r\n\"Touching and illuminating . . . lucid, lyrical . . . a searing and human account.\" New York Times", "asin": "0452271681", "rank": "109451", "city": "Ho Chi Minh City", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fb2s8K9lL.jpg", "country": "Hanoi", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
