For a short book, it certainly packs a punch and gets right into George\u2019s head. His dreams have the power to change reality, which is why he so desperately wants to stop dreaming, but once Dr. Haber realizes what\u2019s in front of him he takes advantage of the situation. He implants dream \u201csuggestions\u201d  into George\u2019s mind but to George, everything is very literal so the end result is not always what the doctor had in mind.People die or cease to exist. They come back. Aliens can\u2019t communicate. Then they can, but only after they become turtles. Check out that cover. Turtles!This is a crazy book but I could easily read it again because there\u2019s so much I missed the first time around. The book club I belong to discussed it last week and it was a good discussion. Apparently, it was also made into a movie. Has anyone read the book or seen the movie?"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I first encountered Ursula Le Guin as a teenager in her Earth Sea Trilogy, a wonderful tale of magic with deeper levels I totally missed in my initial reading. The Lathe of Heaven is for a more mature reader dealing with themes like responsibility, hubris, compassion and love. This is the second time I\u2019ve read the novel and it won\u2019t be the last.When the novel opens George Orr is an unassuming man with a problem. He\u2019s convinced his dreams can change reality and he\u2019s taking illegal drugs to keep him from hurting people while he sleeps. He\u2019s put under the care of Dr. William Haber who\u2019s skepticism quickly disappears as he begins to unethically abuse Orr\u2019s gift through hypnotism and an experimental machine to remake the world into a better place where his own importance is recognized and the big problems\u2014war, racism, overpopulation, etc.\u2014don\u2019t exist anymore. But Orr\u2019s power works through the unconscious and Haber never quite gets the results he wants\u2014not that he blames himself. Success is due to his genius, failure is the fault of the man he\u2019s using his legal hold over to coerce into changing the world.Orr\u2019s effort to get legal help introduces the third and most interesting character to the story. Heather LeLache is a lawyer who becomes interested in Orr\u2019s case and actually sees the world rewritten while she observes his therapy. The shared experience brings Orr and LeLache closer but can their growing friendship\u2014hidden from Haber\u2014survive an ever-rewritten world.The ending of this novel is a painful one filled with growth and horror, but not without hope. This one will make your head spin."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "love this author"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This was a great read and a new twist on science  fiction.  Got a little bit long about half way through  but well written."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "What a great premise! The prose is sound, even poetic. Ursula K. Le Guin brings in her knowledge of the Tao Te Ching as well. An interesting read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Imagine that your dreams had the ability to alter reality. To change not only the present, but also the past and (effectively) the future. And every time you dreamed, you might wake up to a new home, a different job, a changed city, and possibly erase the existence of people you'd known, including loved ones.Then imagine being so frightened by your ability that you start seeing a psychiatrist - and he, upon realizing your \"powers,\" uses you to manipulate the world to his liking.That premise didn't just draw me into Ursula K. Le Guin's THE LATHE OF HEAVEN. Instead, it reeled me in and let me dangle in the wonder, terror, and sheer inventiveness of the story. It did take some time to fall into LATHE's rhythm; there are a fair number of long paragraphs of scientific explanations and other details, both in the dialogue and in the narrative. But once I did, I was utterly absorbed in its shifting landscapes and histories, the hard-to-believe truths and cleverly disguised lies, and George's struggle to find a way to simply fall asleep knowing that he hadn't subconsciously tinkered with the world. And the more that his psychiatrist, Dr. Haber, toyed with George's abilities with every therapy session, the more difficult it became to put this book down.Admittedly LATHE is a bit dated now (it was first published in 1971, with the story set in 2002). But I found it easy enough to re-imagine George's futuristic Portland, Oregon with a 2017 basis. The themes, though, are the real blood and marrow of this book, because they're still relevant today. Humanity's self-destructive behavior, the delicate nature of the patient-doctor relationship, our dependence on medication, and the perils of power... And since it's a UKLG book, I knew I could count on the wisdom, wit, and lyricality that's always present in her writing. Have I said before that I love Ursula's prose? Because I do. And in THE LATHE OF HEAVEN, it gives the conflicts more weight, her insights more depth, and her small cast of characters more complexity.I think THE LEFT HAND OF DARKNESS has finally found competition for the title of My Favorite Science Fiction Book by UKLG."}]}, "authors": ["Ursula K.
