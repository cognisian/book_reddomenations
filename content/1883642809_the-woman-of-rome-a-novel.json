This book was tedious. The plot sounded interesting: a poor but beautiful Italian girl is dreaming of a husband, children and a simple life in a modest but pretty little house. Instead, she becomes, first a model and then a prostitute. An old story but with tons of potential for \"from rags to riches\" tale. Unfortunately, it was plain boring."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book is an amazing read in terms of style and plot. The themes it speaks about made me think a lot about mother-daughter relationship, the role of mother in a girl's life, poverty and wealth, various expressions of love, the concept of intellect and many more. The events were described so intensely that I always wanted to check what was going to happen because I got frustrated with my predictions. I loved this book."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I can't say that I liked this novel though it was interesting to the end. Very old fashioned view of women coming from a man from the bourgeoisie. It could have been written by Dostoyevsky. The pure woman with impure life because born poor. The unhappy student with confused ideas about life and himself. Very melodramatic and finally there is no truth or anything to learn from it. Not very realistic about the life of a prostitute and not very informing about how one can become so cut off from reality as Mino  was.....apart his at times grandiosity betrayed then by his acts. One finishes this novel by wondering why this was thought to be one of the best books of Moravia."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The main character in this novel is a young girl who progresses into prostitution but does not end there. Moravia's telling of her reactions to her various 'lovers' and their relationships to each other is strained and simple minded."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "You really understand the feelings of the main character....and probably typical of her upbringing in those times"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "After wading through this evidently much-appreciated book, I was left with the idea that for me it finally is nothing more nor less than what I might call a restatement of an old theme that goes: \"Disadvantaged people have terribly difficult lives, are vastly unreflective probably owing to their socio-economic status, and no matter what they try, they prove to us once again that it is almost, if not entirely, impossible for a person such as Adriana to change one whit of her life.\"The characters, although not well developed, are almost stereotypes and none of them is really very interesting. If you can't really feel anything about a character you can't learn much and you certainly find it hard to keep reading.  This story is legion and has been part of human existence for probably a zillion years.  If you're trapped, you're trapped, and incapable of thinking in any way that we might today call \"out of the box.\"  You can't even see the box, much less spell it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "So much better than Boredom. This book, besides being a \"good read\" gives the reader much to think about.
