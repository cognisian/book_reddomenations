Though written sometime between 1605 and 1608, this play is still quite relevant to the world we live in today. Set in ancient Rome, it deals with the double-edged sword of public opinion in the never-ending struggle between the ruling elite and the common man.When the play opens, the citizens of Rome are rioting, claiming that a powerful general, Caius Marcius, is withholding grain from them. When Marcius meets them in the street, he responds to their complaints with open contempt, asserting that the common people, whom he sees as whining babes incapable of governing themselves, have no claim to the grain nor any right to question its distribution. As a military commander, war hero, and member of the patrician class, Marcius sees himself justified in adopting a tyrannical attitude towards the plebeians. When the Volscian army threatens Rome, Marcius leads an attack on the enemy\u2019s city of Corioli. After achieving almost superhuman feats of military prowess, he returns to Rome with even more honor, distinction, and power, along with the honorary appellation of Coriolanus. Along with his military success comes increased popularity, though Marcius scorns the praise and recognition bestowed upon him, as if no one is worthy to judge him but himself. Despite his reluctance, he is put forward as a candidate for Consul, but two populist Tribunes, Brutus and Sicinius, scheme to make him pay for his arrogance by turning the tide of public opinion against him.Since this is one of Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies, it\u2019s not difficult to foresee that Marcius\u2019s pride may be his downfall. Rather than merely spelling out good guys and bad guys in black and white terms, however, Shakespeare explores the dilemma of political power and public opinion. To what extent should competent rulers be expected to sacrifice their governing authority in order to pacify the whims of the masses? In broader terms, where does one find the ideal balance between monarchy (or meritocracy) and democracy?Coriolanus is frequently ranked by critics among Shakespeare\u2019s better plays (i.e. in the top half). If it\u2019s so great, why isn\u2019t it more widely read? Maybe because it\u2019s a little too close to Julius Caesar\u2014an arrogant tyrant ousted by his envious rivals\u2014without actually being Julius Caesar. Though Coriolanus was a real Roman general of the 5th century BC, he doesn\u2019t have the name recognition of Caesar or any of the English kings whose names title Shakespeare\u2019s history plays. Another reason may be that Caius Marcius Coriolanus is one of Shakespeare\u2019s least sympathetic heroes. There is no denying the extreme arrogance of which he is accused. Marcius is a surly and taciturn character, not given to soliloquy. Thus, the audience doesn\u2019t get inside his head in the same way that we are privy to the thoughts of Caesar or Hamlet. It\u2019s hard to think of a character in the play that\u2019s even likable. That only makes the play all the more authentic to what we see in today\u2019s political climate, where unsullied heroes are few and far between.It was the 2011 film version starring Ralph Fiennes and Gerard Butler that drew my attention to Coriolanus. Set in the modern world of machine guns and TV news, the movie demonstrates very effectively how Shakespeare\u2019s centuries-old work is still pertinent to the world in which we live. For anyone looking to explore Shakespeare\u2019s lesser-known plays, Coriolanus is definitely a compelling read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "See the Play.

I see a strong, hotheaded, blunt soldier that falls victim of a conspiracy lead by a government that is afraid of his power, strength of character and popularity. Coriolanus is arrogant proto-fascist that fails to become a politician, as his mother and the Roman government want him to be. Consequently, he walks right into a trap in which he falls victim. At the same time that he is a brute, he's also modest and honest with his comrades and himself until the very end. Furthermore, he had the courage to choose that was best for his family despite his thirst for revenge and knowing that his life was on the line.In the end, his mistake is to remain himself no matter how much the people around him try to make him something he is not.

The people win the right to be represented by tribunes. Meanwhile, there are foreign enemies near the gates of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe play explores one reason that Rome prevailed over such vulnerabilities: its reverence for family bonds. Coriolanus so esteems his mother, Volumnia, that he risks his life to win her approval. Even the value of family, however, is subordinate to loyalty to the Roman state. When the two obligations align, the combination is irresistible.\r\n\r\nCoriolanus is so devoted to his family and to Rome that he finds the decision to grant the plebians representation intolerable. To him, it elevates plebeians to a status equal with his family and class, to Rome\u2019s great disadvantage. He risks his political career to have the tribunate abolished\u2014and is banished from Rome. Coriolanus then displays an apparently insatiable vengefulness against the state he idolized, opening a tragic divide within himself, pitting him against his mother and family, and threatening Rome\u2019s very existence.", "asin": "0140714731", "rank": "457683", "city": "Rome", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Asz-7emNL.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
