Read it."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This book has an element of Marmite to it \u2013 people either love it or hate it. But it appears to me, from amongst my friends list, that those that hate it are looking for something else within its pages, which isn\u2019t necessarily to be found.So, what was I looking for in this book? A compelling story? An adventure? Something I\u2019d never seen before? Hints of what people have raved about? Beautiful writing? Well, not particularly, as I view each new book as a unique adventure that I let the book itself take me on and reveal. I try to come along with as few preconceptions or ideas as possible. And yet, I did find just about all of these within. And, not only that, right at the beginning, just as I was starting to read, I found that it\u2019s a book that *connects* people. I was barely twelve pages in when a lady comes up behind me on the tram and tells me that she is halfway reading through the same book (albeit the Dutch translation instead of the English), a little bit further on, and that with a little patience it slowly unfolds and flowers into a compelling story. And she wasn\u2019t the only one to notice me reading the book \u2013 a few nods of approval later and I came to understand why people absolutely love the book, and also why others hate it.Starting the book, considering its location and setting, I thought back to a previous book I had read, set during the War years in Spain,\u00a0Winter in Madrid, which gives much of the darkness of the times. It made me nervous as, even though it\u2019s based around a different Spanish city, I\u2019d already seen the war times depicted in a less-than-pleasing manner. But, luckily, the writing here reassured me that it would be a far different story, written much better, with the shadow of the war more of a backdrop than a main focus (although, rereading my review, it was more the ending that let down that previous book).So as the threads wound me through their various streets and alleys, from mountains to the sea, it becomes apparent that the story isn\u2019t so much about books, as the effect of books, about the journey both outside and inside the pages, and what not only leads a young boy on to discover the story behind the book he had discovered, but leaves you just as intrigued as he and yearning for the truth.If it weren\u2019t for the slower parts, the various monologues, I might have been more excited. I did thoroughly enjoy the book, but those minor moments of boredom during those slower monologues put a bit of a shadow on an otherwise fantastic book. Also, the fact that it is not so easy to see the character behind the monologues, especially ones you would like to understand, leaves a slight air of disappointment. I did, in the end, find sympathy with characters I didn\u2019t expect to. The major reveal, I had suspected for quite some time before, although I was deceived previously into mistaking one character for another until at that moment when it was absolutely obvious. Yet all these monologues, the various loose threads, lead to reveal a story told from many sides with all the various interpretations on what had happened. The true story behind all those whispers and rumours shows a far more complex story than could be imagined in the first few pages. Overall, the author doesn\u2019t do a bad job of tying it all together, but it\u2019s the words, the beautiful lines that tie it all together in the end, and makes it a book that has to be loved."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "One thing I can say for this book is that it will not bore you. The plot moves quickly, from one bizarre, threatening episode to another. It is full of romance, Danger, and passion. However, the author does not even attempt at realism or subtlety. Even minor characters have bizarre or grotesque backstories. A setting of minor importance has  a former owner who collected fetuses in various stages of development. Even marginal figures die dramatically, eaten by animals or falling from large heights, when it seems a simple gunshot or heart attack might do once and a while. A servant moves to the city not to get a job but fleeing shame and abuse, led by demonic visions. In order to avoid spoilers, I am only mentioning minor plot points, but the heart of the narrative is no more realistic, subtle, or restrained. I do not particularly enjoy this style of writing, but I am sure it has its audience. If you like gothic melodrama chock full of grotesque detail with intense, evocative language at every breath, you will probably enjoy this. If you prefer Raymond Chandler and Cormac McCarthy, put the book down and run like hell."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It's not a perfect book or great literature but it's lovely to read.
