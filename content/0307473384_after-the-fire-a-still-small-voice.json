It was often so confusing I just stopped reading it. It jumps between two main characters, which is easy enough to follow. But then they jump back and forth between various points in their lives, and various people in their lives, then and now, leaving the reader stumped."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This is first and foremost an Aussie novel.  It would be hard to think of the characters existing anywhere else.  The slang, the settings, the conflicts are quintessentially Australian--and overwhelmingly male, which the female Wyld nails.  I'm not sure what the point of the book was, but the journeys each of the main characters set off on are fully engrossing.  A little too much hard drinking for my tastes, but again, for this class of Aussie probably right on the money."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I have just discovered Evie Wyld' s writing and it has blown me away. Her language is so fresh but utterly to the point, and I feel I know her characters in all their flaws and sorrows. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough, as well as her subsequent book All the Birds, Singing. I can't wait to see what she produces next."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "\u201cEucalyptus blanketed the room. He had the feeling that the trees were peering in through the windows, that they had uprooted and crept over to take a peek. The leaves of the banana tree on the roof were a gentle tap tap tap let me in\u201dAfter the Fire, a Still Small Voice is the first novel by prize-winning Australian author, Evie Wyld. A story that spans three generations, it is told from the perspective of Frank, who, in the present day, is fleeing behaviour he is ashamed of; and of Leon, decades earlier, forced to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps.Frank arrives at Mulaburry, determined that life in his grandparents\u2019 hut in the cane-fields will help him forget Lucy, the woman he mistreated. \u201cThe clearing was smaller than he remembered, like the cane had slunk closer to the pale wooden box hut. The banana tree stooped low over a corrugated roof\u201d.Having watched the broken remains of his father, once a master baker, return from the Korean War, Leon finds himself plucked from his own baking career to land in the jungles of Vietnam.Wyld alternates the narratives so that the significant events of each man\u2019s life are gradually revealed, and the reader learns how one man\u2019s history impacts on that of the other. There are common elements to each narrative, echoes that draw the stories together: the wedding-cake figurines, the baker\u2019s fare, the cane-fields hut.Wyld\u2019s characters are real and flawed, characters for whom the reader can readily hope, be disappointed in and exult in minor triumphs. Their moods are deftly evoked: \u201cWith effort he stood up, ignored the squealed noises of the teacher, the weird electric sound of laughter, saw only that Amy Blackwell\u2019s blue eyes watched him as he walked out of the classroom, away from the school, heavy enough that he might sink into the ground and suffocate, or else fall on the pavement and shatter into splinters\u201dWyld touches on some topical and age-old issues: domestic violence; child abduction; the devastating effect of war on the combatants\u2019 psyche; the lack of support for Vietnam Veterans; racial discrimination. Wyld has a talent for descriptive prose and conveys her settings with consummate ease: the humidity of the Vietnamese jungle, the sounds of the Queensland cane-field, the langour of a Sydney Christmas, all are vividly heard, seen and felt. A stunning debut."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "3.5 I chose this novel after discovering Evie Wyld's All the Birds Singing--which I absolutely loved! After the Fire didn't grab me in the quite the same way though I enjoyed the flawed characters, their demons and their search for answers. Frank is reclusive and quiet and battling demons that send him to the abandoned shack he last visited as a teenager. He shares the narrative with Leon, whose story takes place forty years earlier, and as the two tales weave together we come to understand how and why they are related. This is very much a story of how war effects those who return from battle, and it's rarely pretty. The writing is subtle yet evocative, at times unflinching. I did, at times, find myself confused between the two characters. The voices weren't different enough and towards the end I was sometimes unsure which character had experienced what event. Perhaps that was the purpose..."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I really loved this book. You can almost taste the ocean brine and it creates a powerful sense of the rough, down at heel but essentially good hearted sea side community in much the way I found Joy Dettman's early books did. The story proper explores the lives of father and son before, through and after the senseless wars that blight their lives (and those of the women who love them). The story moved backwards and forwards between father and son so you need to concentrate, but it is a thrill to find such a beautifully written and moving book.

Two stories running in parallel, the age-old issues of how the sins (in this case, trials) of the father impact on the son, and the skeletons buried in every family closet, set against the beautifully drawn background of rural Australia. The author's descriptions are the kind to stop you in your tracks and make you think \"I would so love to have written that\", always evocative, never cliched. Add to that a set of odd relationships, a cast of very quirky characters (especially the little girl) and an atmosphere that feels like a cool breeze on a really hot day and you come near what to expect with this novel.
