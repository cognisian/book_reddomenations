In this exquisite book, Steinbach searches for the answer to this question in some of the most beautiful and exciting places in the world: Paris, where she finds a soul mate; Oxford, where she takes a course on the English village; Milan, where she befriends a young woman about to be married. \r\n\r\nBeautifully illustrated with postcards from Steinbach\u2019s journeys, this revealing and witty book transports you into a fascinating inner and outer journey, an unforgettable voyage of discovery.", "asin": "0375758453", "rank": "123414", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XgmOHKFBL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
