This is dark and then some. There is a lot of layers to this - great portrayals of historical figures, a horrific murder, a hanging, a trial and all this with a musical backdrop and an insight into the music halls of the 1800sThere\u2019s mentions of the Ratcliffe Highway murders, references to Jack the Ripper but this Limehouse Golem is quite something else. The story and the  mystery of this creature unfurls like a snake, then there is silence and stillness and then BAM the snake strikesI enjoyed the mix of fact, fiction and myth and tales of what might be lurking in the dank London streets. If the book is this good I can\u2019t wait to see the film but I saw the book play out in my mind and it\u2019s  a dark world out there.It reads more like something written in Mary Shelley\u2019s day - and there\u2019s plenty of Frankenstein- esque moments in this book."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem was a dark, twisted tale set back in Victorian London in the wake of the Ratcliffe Highway murders. Peter Ackroyd has done an excellent job in his research to plot his murder mystery around real people and events.Dan Leno has a strong plot that is well balanced with device and references. Thomas de Quincey\u2019s work is mentioned several times, and notable personalities like Karl Marx, George Gissing, and Dan Leno are integrated into the plot as characters rather than abstractions.The brooding and grotesque setting of Victorian London was well established. The events and context were appropriate to the plot and advanced my visualization of the dark, smoggy, and dirty streets and theatres of London.The character development was good\u2014especially Elizabeth Cree: a Victorian woman whose history of victimization in many respects makes her stronger. She is in control of her personhood, her image, and her prosperity for much of her life. She overcomes adversity and faces challenges head-on. This balance of struggle and resistance makes her a believable Victorian woman, but also one who I could sympathize with. Dan Leno and John Cree were also consistent and believable primary characters.Pacing was strong, and the breakdown of chapters by the shifting first-person perspectives of the lead characters was both exciting and fun weaving all their stories together. But suspense was lacking. I expect suspense in a strong murder mystery\u2014something that leaves some mystery right up to the end of the story\u2014but there was really only one mystery to solve and that became apparent about mid-way through the book. However, because our murderer is a serial killer, there was some mystery in not knowing how or when they would strike again, and Ackroyd did keep the plot developing in the latter half of the book. There was just a lack of surprise. Events were either predictable, or just made sense without adding any shock value or major twists in the plot.I would recommend this story, especially so to murder mystery or historical fiction fans. I would also recommend this story to people who have read Peter Ackroyd\u2019s work before, because I believe this is one of his best. The only reason I did not give this a 4-star rating is because I do not see myself picking it up to read for a second time. Overall, I definitely enjoyed this read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "My husband bought this for me, I have been looking for it for ages.  It is an excellent and smartly written book.  Ackroyd uses historical figures to intertwine with fictional and non fictional characters, adding them all together on a stage of murder and confusion.  I am hoping that the movie version will live up to this book.  It's one of a kind and it stays with the reader days after you close the book.  I highly recommend this book!Chessica"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I bought this book for my husband, and he read it but didn't care for it.  He would have preferred a biography or autobiography of Dan Leno."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Many in our group enjoyed the author's `Hawksmoor'. This novel was written nine years later and follows many of the same themes and fascinations, one might almost say obsessions.This is a kaleidoscope of fragments which builds up the story by extracts from a (made up) diary, a trial transcript and the main character's early history.  It begins at both ends and works towards the solution in the middle. There are surprises at the end of chapters, little hints all along so you wonder why a suspected a murderer reads Tennyson to his wife,  but it is not until you get to the end that they sink in so it maybe worth reading the book a second time to appreciate its clever crafting. No linear narrative here then, just like Ackroyd's other London books.These fragments come from all over the place and the author makes sense of them, just as we try to make sense out of the many events which make up out lives. One important fragment, woven into the story, is the main character, Lambeth Marsh Lizzie (Elizabeth Cree after her marriage) who is reminiscent of the title of W. Somerset Maugham's novel, Liza of Lambeth. Maybe Ackroyd based his character on her because there are parallels: both are young women who have gone astray; both are the only child of a religious, hypocritical mother who mistreats them; both oppose their mother's will; and both have lived all their childhood in poverty in Lambeth approximately in the same period. Both novels, deal with popular theatre influencing the lives and behaviour of the urban masses. Leno says, \"We never do dirty - but double-entendres.\"Typically post-modern, the novel muses on the self. Who am I? Are we a consistent, integrated person or am I a series of different selves, reacting to the different people I meet, as it were a selection of stage personas. Poststructuralists tend to see the 'self' not as a fixed unity but more like a flux or a process which adapts to different situations and discourses it encounters. Elizabeth Cree does six acts a night, moving from theatre to theatre. She can be a girl, boy, man or woman. And Dan Leno \"played so many parts that he hardly had time to be himself. And yet, somehow, he was always himself. He was the Indian squaw, the waiter, the milkmaid, or the train driver, but it was always Dan conjuring people out of thin air. .....suddenly he was the sour-faced spinster on the look-out for a man.\" This Dan Leno is the master of masks and poses,  \"He is endless\" (But the real Dan Leno had a mental breakdown - his character(s) disintegrated.)Where do we and the people in the book get our `characters' from? Dan Leno wished to \"understand the conditions which had, in a sense, created him\"  He reads The Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi as well as Thomas De Quincey's essay on the famous clown, identified with him and saw parallels between Grimaldi's and his own life. He, as it were, becomes him: when he lays sick and dying he repeats, word for word, Grimaldi's farewell speech, \"while those around his deathbed believed he was delirious.\"  So Ackroyd emphasizes that we are products of our culture, and no more than that.  Our thoughts, dreams, and behaviour reflect our cultural and textual experience. We are what we read; everything we do or say has its complex origins in textual or cultural sources. \"Sometimes I believe that I am made of ink and paper\", says Karl Marx.Ackroyd's interest in literary criticism is reflected here. Most of the characters are involved with texts, either reading, writing or stage acting. His characters read De Quincey's essays. Karl Marx takes down from the shelf Dialogues of Three Templars on Political Economy by Thomas De Quincey, Dan Leno reads De Quincey's essay on pantomime, 'Laugh, Scream and Speech'. George Gissing writes his first public essay, 'Romanticism and Crime', and extols Thomas De Quincey's impassionate prose. Most obviously, Thomas De Quincey's essay \"On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts\", an essay which evokes a sinister London, \"a city of footsteps and flaring lights, of houses packed close together, of lacrymose alleys and false doors.\" is surely where the author borrowed the crime plot, the ominous atmosphere of approaching doom; narrating from the murderer's point of view, the access to the killer's disturbed mind, the parallels between murder and acting, and the theatrical imagery which depicts the murderer very much like an artist in crime. Ackroyd even goes so far as to use the same setting (two houses on the Ratcliffe Highway, East London) and the same method of murder (the use of a mallet and a razor to crush the victims' skulls and cut their throats).The story, like the masks we wear in life, are all borrowed. John Cree plans to write a novel about urban poverty and \"the crime and disease which it engendered\" He does not go to the streets to collect his material but, instead, his first place of study is the Reading Room of the British Museum. \"He had reserved a copy of Plumstead's History of the London Poor and Molton's A Few Sighs From Hell. Both books were concerned with the life of the indigent and the vagrant in the capital, and for that reason they were of especial interest to him.\" So too, Ackroyd imitates the work of others: Dickens, Gaskell or George Gissing.Where is integration to be found? The Reading Room of the British Museum becomes a place of almost mystical quality in this novel, the meeting point between various texts and discourses; this is where the roots of all the events in the book derive from; this is a giant library which can \"be said to have affected the course of human history\". For George Gissing, who shares the author's sense of place and identification of a spiritual home. Gissing lived 'in the valley of the shadow of books'.However, close to the centre of spirituality comes the occult, another of Ackroyd's interests. Black and white go hand in hand.  Occult shops are to be found near the British Museum. And Gissing wonders about the invention of the calculating machine that may be draining away life, with souls trapped within it, maybe prefiguring computers and the alternative `reality' of the online persona in social networking sites as an evasion of `real life'?For a gay author, there are only two gay characters, the detective and his engineer boyfriend.There are some strange terms used to describe people, probably commonly use at that time: Romanist, Hebrew.Elizabeth's childhood was spent in a house where the wallpaper was pages from the bible. Her Bible references are accurate, like Dot Cotton in East Enders. Her death bed confession shows her feistiness: \"And I will fry eternally? I am surprised at you, father, for such childish notions. I cannot think of hell as some fish-shop. ....A sole may be fried, too.\", but also her mixing up of reality with pretence. She regarded the Mass as `such fun', rather like the music hall where she had spent most of her working life.So everything about us is created. But we should beware what we create. It could be a Frankenstein or a golem."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Elizabeth Cree is hanged at the beginning of this book for the murder of her husband, but was she guilty?We are then taken into the Victorian world of theatre and gross murder.Ackroyd writes about London superbly and he has managed to combine this with a good crime novel, some wonderfully horrible writing here."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Dan Leno And The Limehouse Golem is quite simply a masterpiece. Every aspect of the novel is remarkable. It's a whodunit, though it suggests a couple of credible suspects right at the start. It even convicts its central character to death by hanging before we have even got to know her. Clearly things are not going to be obvious. The novel is also a study in character, especially that of its central actor, Lambeth Marsh Lizzie, later Mrs Elizabeth Cree. It's also an evocation of London in the late nineteenth century, complete with colours, smells, vistas and perspectives.  It's a highly literary work, ever conscious of its place beside the genres it skirts. Overall, it's a wonderful example of how form can be used as inventively as plot to create a story.The novel has a series of interlocking stands. In one our anti-heroine, Lizzie, is accused of the murder of John Cree, her husband. In another, John Cree's diary reveals certain secrets that not only he would have wanted to hide. In a third strand, we learn of Lambeth Marsh Lizzie's past, how she came to a life in the theatre and how she met her husband. A fourth strand follows the career of Dan Leno, a music hall player, worshipper of the silent clown Grimaldi and mentor of Lizzie's stage life. And in a fifth strand we see how, in a great city like London, our paths inevitably cross those of great thinkers, writers, artists and, of course, history itself. Peter Ackroyd thus has his characters cross the paths of a writer, George Gissing, and a thinker of note, one Karl Marx, as they tramp the streets of Limehouse after a day at the library.As usual, sex has a lot to do with the relationships in the book. It is usually on top, but here it also comes underneath and sometimes on the side of events. Mrs Cree is accused of poisoning her husband. Their married life has been far from conventional, but are its inadequacies the motive for a series of brutal killings of prostitutes and others in the Limehouse area? As a result of the curious placement of certain trophies, the killings are attributed in the popular mind to a golem, a mythical creature made of clay that can change it shape at will. Karl Marx examines the Jewish myths surrounding the subject. Others steer clear of the subject.Lizzie continues on the stage until she meets her husband. She learns much stagecraft from Dan Leno and eventually resolves to help her husband to complete the play over which he has unsuccessfully laboured. When the book's plot resolves, we are surprised, but then everything makes such perfect sense. And in a real piece of insight, Peter Ackroyd likens the mass murderer to Romaticism perfected, the ultimate triumph of individualism. There is much to stimulate the mind in this thriller.A reader of this review might suspect that Dan leno And The Limehouse Golem is a difficult read, a book whose diverse strands never converge. But quite the contrary is true: it comes together in a wonderful, fast-flowing manner to a resolution that is both highly theatrical yet thoroughly credible. Read it many times."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Peter Ackroyd is a great writer.  His seemless mixture of styles, techniques, a brooding sense of place and time jumps creates some of the best fiction being written today. However, that being said, I find that this novel left me out and did not engage or make me care about any of the  characters. The same complaint has been made about Stanley Kubrick's  movies.  I can appreciate the master's touch, but it is sometimes too cold."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The concept of time folding in and repeating itself, retracing ones own steps, spreads throughout this book.
