Loved the well developed characters, the concept of the development of the restaurant and the fit for the setting.Mostly  I loved the treatment of Rickey and G-Man. I look hard to find books that have strong gay characters, but stories that are about something else. I know what it is like to be gay. I don't need anyone to explain it. I want to hear well told stories about people I can relate to"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "What more could you want?A fun read for foodies and wannabe chefs & restaurateurs .

Brite.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans natives Rickey and G-man are lifetime friends and down-and-out line cooks desperate to make a quick buck. When Rickey concocts the idea of opening a restaurant in their alcohol-loving hometown where every dish packs a spirited punch, they know they\u2019re on their way to the bank. With some wheeling and dealing, a slew of great recipes, and a few lucky breaks, Rickey and G-man are soon on their way to opening Liquor, their very own restaurant. But first they need to pacify a local crank who doesn\u2019t want to see his neighborhood disturbed, sidestep Rickey\u2019s deranged ex-boss, rein in their big-mouth silent partner before he runs amok, and stay afloat in a stew of corruption in a town well known for its bottom feeders.\r\n\r\nA manic, spicy romp through the kitchens, back alleys, dive bars, and drug deals of the country\u2019s most sublimely ridiculous city, author Poppy Z. Brite masterfully shakes equal parts ambition, scandal, cocaine, and murder, and serves Liquor straight up, with a twist.", "asin": "1400050073", "rank": "820718", "city": "New Orleans", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-%2B6yya2SL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
