Because how can someone be a good teacher when he has an inborn drive towards the abyss?\u201d My father, a highly respected high school and college teacher of art and art history disproves this conclusion.  In any case, if the novel contained more of these assertions, I might understand how it has attained a certain level of literary prominence, but there are three elements of this book that are difficult to understand:1. The protagonist\u2019s infatuation and obsession with young Tadziu defies comprehension even though the author devotes most of the book to this endeavor.2. It is also difficult to understand how a novel about an esteemed author, which contains many reflections on his life and his art, contains only three brief sentences about his family.  There are not very many concise sentences in this novella, but the sentences about his family are three of them.3.
