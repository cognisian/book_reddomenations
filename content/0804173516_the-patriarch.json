Still I've given this one four stars, despite the excursion into  Russian-French history and politics, because of his marvelous descriptions of that countryside and its food and its characters. You can't not like his Bruno series. Sometimes the plots are better, sometimes less successful, but the characters are always delightful and the coziness of his environment is addictive. I have never regretted submerging myself in his town of St Denis and vicariously enjoying its food and drink. I expect to go on reading him for several more years."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Well, the Bruno formula is surviving, but the plot stretches are getting more and more incredible."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This is the sixth Bruno novel I have read and the least satisfying. The recycled characters are starting to taste like reheated leftovers. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I can live with food porn, it's the plot that's become a moldy Swiss cheese. And where did the author get the idea that the Soviet Yak was the fastest propeller driven fighter of WW2, and why was that error even necessary?I have to agree with earlier reviewers  that the editors seemed to be asleep at the switch.The novel is a little like a soap opera or like an SNL satire of a soap opera.Despite my complaint I miss badass Isabelle.This one has soured me on Bruno for a while."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great fun, the ending is a bit contrived but that is a minor quibble."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Love this series, as I resided in France and visited this region.

This one was as good as all the rest, but I am concerned that St. Denis is becoming a global battleground.  It is starting to seem like all the troubles of the world are focused right there.  I live in a small village in Washington state in sight of an international boundary and we don't seem to have that kind of intrigue taking place, which is to say plots in the novels are becoming unrealistic to say the least.
