The story is a bit predictable, because you know who the players are in advance, but Mahfouz plays with their histories enough to provide some surprises, and the way he interprets the temperament of the great spiritual leaders is designed to be entertaining and leave you wondering what will happen next.  The writing is quite good, better than in many of his books, though I don't know how much of this is Mahfouz and how much is the translator.  The book is fast-paced, and I found myself turning pages quite rapidly as the heroes appear on the scene, take on the bad guys, and effect spiritual enlightenment which never lasts long.  I have read many Mahfouz books, and this one is a gem.  I found it on a list of great world literature, and I agree with whoever made that list; this story is excellent.  Highly recommended!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I thought that the book started a bit slowly, and the allegories were a bit heavy handed.  On the plus side the author is an excellent story teller with some points about religion, science, and politics that are still valid 60 years later.  Good sense of place."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is one of my favorite books. I first read it in its original language (Arabic)  years ago when I was in Grade 8 or 9. Then I read it again in English and I was in love with it again. I'm re-reading it now in Arabic and English at the same time and having a fantastic time.Perhaps many people noticed the similarity of the stories with the bible not knowing that the writer actually based it also on the Qura'n. I find that heartwarming."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It is a good Novel to read when you have time"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Brilliant"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A++++"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A+"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I shouldn't have purchased this I think....I'm not good with fiction writing.
