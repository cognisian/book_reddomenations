Our celebrating his life and grieving over his death, however, will. Good cheer and mournfulness over lives other than our own, even wholly invented lives \u2013 no, especially wholly invented lives \u2013 deprive the world as it is of some of the greed it needs to continue to be itself. Sabotage and subversion, then, are this book\u2019s objectives. Go, my book, and help destroy the world as it is.\u201dBob, our main character, is a young man (late 20\u2019s) growing up in New Hampshire, who, although he doesn\u2019t know it yet, is surrounded by examples to avoid \u2013 his father, his older brother, his best friend. He repairs oil burners in a dying town in the dead cold of New Hampshire\u2019s winters. He has a wife, two daughters, a crappy car, a crappy house, but a nice boat, (almost paid off) and a woman on the side.But Bob has a white guy problem: it\u2019s just not enough. His older brother appears to be living the good life in Florida. Both Bob and his money-obsessed older brother seem overly or unrealistically influenced by ads on TV for tropical vacations and Mercedes.Thus begins the two threads of the story: two families seeking better lives in Florida \u2013 one family in New Hampshire and one in Haiti. We know from the beginning they will meet in tragedy of almost unimaginable proportion. As hard as it is to believe, we are told that Bob, in his late 20\u2019s, has previously had \u201cno interaction with black people\u201d even though he\u2019s been in the service.Fast-forward to Florida. Bob works for his brother and lives in a one-bedroom dilapidated trailer. Later he runs sport fishing boats for his best friend and, unlike his best friend, he won\u2019t smuggle drugs on the side but the thinks he\u2019s helping people out by smuggling in illegal Haitian immigrants. A big and tragic mistake.The novel becomes almost a catalog of the financial holes the unsuspecting pursuers of the American Dream can fall into. And the way we get sucked into stereotypes of how the grass is greener over the state line. Just two weeks ago I read an article about a small community of 100 people in Florida who have unsafe water and whose average annual income is $10,000 \u2013 try living on that in sunny Florida!Some quotes I liked:\u201cWhen you seek to acquire the love of someone who resembles you, in gender, temperament, culture or physical type, you do so for love of those aspects of yourself, gender, temperament, culture, etc.; but when you seek the love of someone different from you, you do so to be rid of yourself.\u201dAfter a white guy shows up waving a gun in the home of a black family, threatening the father and daughter who live there: \u201cShe and her father never speak of the event again, not to each other and not to anyone else. There\u2019s nothing to say about it to each other that is not already fully understood, so they remain silent about it, almost as if it never happened.\u201dBob reflects on the role of luck in life: \u201cAnd luck can\u2019t last a lifetime, unless you die young.\u201dWhen this book was published in 1985, James Atlas, a writer and editor for the Atlantic, called it \u201cThe most convincing portrait I know of contemporary America.\u201d Maybe it was then.This is my first Russell Banks. I found it a very good read but bit overdone with some of the characters bordering on stereotypes. Bob\u2019s ignorance of black people seems extreme; his callousness and nonchalance about his extra-marital affairs seems overdone; his brother\u2019s ties with Mafia-type guys and his profanity seem melodramatic as does the way the poverty and the docility of the Haitian immigrants are portrayed. I don\u2019t know exactly what it was but it was almost a \"did not finish\" for me about a third of the way through. Yet I stuck with it and in the end I was glad I did and I gave it a 4."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Thought provoking but very long.  I reread the last chapter.

Continental Drift did that, and made me look forward to reading another installment every day.The story is told by a third-person, detached narrator. The story itself is chock full of emotion, mostly anger and sadness. It could not have been told as well from any one character's point of view. It charts the paths of two seemingly very different characters, who actually have similar dark tragic lives. Then it invites the reader to think about the human condition and their own life in the same light.It sounds like something one would want to avoid, but the skill of the writer at deciding what to focus the narrator on, and the beauty of the writing itself was worth it. It didn't even matter to me that the climax is apparent at about the half-way point in the book.  I will seek out more works by Russell Banks."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "So glad that I finally got around to reading Continental Drift and seeing what all the Russell Banks fuss was about!  I admit to being annoyed when the New Hampshire contingent was replaced by the Haitians-- maybe I've just read one too many shifting point of view novels lately.  But I grew to care about both sets of characters and their respective plights and realized that somewhere they would converge.  Banks's fine ear for dialogue and unflinching examination of the dark side of the American Dream create characters and plot developments that ring all too true."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Wonderful modern classic.
