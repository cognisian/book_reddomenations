Both his many amateur fans as well as hosts of professional critics felt that he had deserved the Nobel price for literature. The decisions made by the Nobel judges are politically driven and arcane, sometimes to the point of incomprehensibility. Numerous far inferior writers were awarded the prize during Kemal\u2019s long career. Memed, My Hawk, Kemal\u2019s most famous work, was first published in 1955. It is an intense, intricately woven, often emotional yarn set among the remote villages, forests and mountains of Southwest Turkey a century or so ago. Its inhabitants, a largely illiterate and ignorant peasantry, still live under an ancient feudal system dominated by corrupt and brutal local tyrants. Their sentiments are swept backwards and forwards by irrational waves of gossip, piety, superstition, rumor, lies and obfuscation.  It is a fast paced, gripping and suspenseful story. Yet underlying it is a profound meditation on good and evil and their impact on a society. Good characters and bad characters emerge within the labyrinthine plot. Some are brave and some poltroonish. Some combine these characteristics or switch between them. A few triumph, a greater number perish.  In the impoverished and isolated communities of that era, life and death existed in close parallel. Often they intertwined, as did good and evil. The erratic and unexpected twists and turns of each defined the lives of the peasant villagers. These forces also etched the fate of the story\u2019s hero, Slim Memed, an idealistic and heroic young man driven into the mountains and a life of brigandry by the savage cruelty of a mendacious local chieftain. Memed, My Hawk has come to be regarded as a classic. I doubt that it is possible to define precisely what constitutes a classic novel. But I also believe that few who read this book will not find it belongs in that rarified category."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent service.
