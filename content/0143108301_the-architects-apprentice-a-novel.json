The author seemed to capture the era thoroughly.  My main objection was the tone of the writing, i.e., like a child speaking throughout.  Also, the characters were one dimensional.

The book fascinated me and kept me engrossed because of the great story it told and the period of history it encompassed."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "An interesting book.
