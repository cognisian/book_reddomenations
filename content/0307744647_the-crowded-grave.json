He's also irresistible to women -- He can't be all that attractive.  I almost forgot to mention that he's smarter than a whole chapter of Mensa.  I bought several of the books (this is the second one I've read)  because they  (the NYTimes) told me it was heavy on French ambience.  I found that I was able to tolerate the disappointments of the first book but as I slogged thru the Crowded Grave it became irritating.  The Little Library in my apartment building is getting 5 or 6 Bruno books.Hmmm. Maybe a few Maigret books (3 or 4) will be another to get me back on track."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "If you liked the other three Bruno books, you'll love this one. Martin Walker is truly a craftsman. I am trying not to binge read these but not very hard.

He paints a very attractive portrait of the Perigord region, and his characters are mildly amusing, But Walker is no Dorothy Sayers, Christie, Leon, Maron . . . well, you get the picture.  I invariably guess 'whodunit' early on, and after reading a couple of the books one learns to expect our hero to do everything better than the experts: spelunking, fire rescue, tactical maneuvers, you name it.  The author and our hero also seem to like their women strongly feminist, ready to jump in the sack with casual acquaintances, but disinterested in marriage or family.  The admiration palls.  But, despite that, some of the characters are well drawn, the cooking is appetizing, and the history and plot lines are clever and well researched."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Solid characters as always, balanced action humor and down time.
