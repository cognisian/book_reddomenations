While the author mentions that there are better books to be read (Paul Preston, Anthony Beevor, Hugh Thomas), I still thought that this would be an annotated version and how the Spanish Civil War shaped the world. The book did this, but in a very clunky and boring way. There were some spots of greatness, but most of the book seemed like a medical history than a overall history. If you are a fan of Mr. Rhodes, then buy the book, otherwise buy an actual history on the Spanish Civil War."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Having read \"The Making of the Atomic Bomb\" a few years ago, I was expecting another masterpiece.  I would stil heartily recommend that bok to anyone.This, on the other hand, fails innmany ways.  It begins as a kind of history of medical treatment advances first used in the war in Spain.  This is not what it was billed as.  Eventually, it loses even that focus, and meanders dusjointedly through a few familiar anecdotes.  I should have put it down after reading half of it, but my desire for completion forced me to waste more time I will never get back.  I don't know what the author wanted to accomplish here.  Perhaps he had a contract to deliver a book and threw together some research notes to turn in to a hapless editor."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Gave to a friend as a gift - not sure yet if he liked it because he never mentioned if he opened it to read it."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I found this book hard going at first, as I expected a brief traditional history of the Spanish Civil War, and found the narrative somewhat difficult to follow without any organizing discussion of battles and strategy. The book is episodic \u2014 here is the story of a Canadian doctor working on blood transfusions, here is the story of Ernest Hemingway, here is the story of Pablo Picasso. The figures from the different sections of the book never meet each other. We see parts of the war (1937 in particular) from numerous perspectives typically away from the front line, but this should be viewed as only a supplement to a more traditional history of the war."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Rhodes writes an easy read, semi-informative book about the Spanish Civil War (1936 to 1939) that pitted the Fascists forces of General Francisco Franco against Spain\u2019s \u201cRepublican\u201d government. The Spanish government was far from a democracy\u2014it was a pseudo-communist government that was suffused with Comintern agents of the Soviet Union. In May 1937, Spanish Communists took over the government.Fighting with Franco were German and Italian air, artillery, and ground forces. Supporting the government were the military forces of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republic. About two-million soldiers were involved in the war\u2014200,000 killed and many thousands more wounded and missing. Unfortunately, this book has no central theme\u2014it has minimal coherence. Occasionally, Rhodes offers a snippet of the war about and who is doing what to whom, but mostly he focuses his narrative on the volunteer British medical personnel tending to wounded Republican soldiers: their heroism, dedication, and professionalism. Mostly, I reckon he discusses the Western expatriates that pontificated about the horrors of the war and the awful Fascists. Actually, this book is not about the Civil War in Spain, it\u2019s about the expatriates in Spain during the Civil War. Here are a few of these people:\u2022 Ernest Hemingway. An American novelist. Whilst drinking, womanizing, and sending dispatches to the North American Alliance, he worked with Joris Ivens (Dutch artist and Communist) producing the agitprop film titled, The Spanish Earth.\u2022 Martha Gellhorn, Hemingway\u2019s wife. American novelist, poet, political activist, and war correspondent. Worked trying to get Basque children evacuated to safety.\u2022 George Orwell, British leftist, novelist, and journalist. Volunteered to fight with the people\u2019s militias \u201cThe Workers\u2019 Party of Marxist Unification.\u201d Wounded in the throat, he was medically discharged and returned to England. In the following years he wrote the satirical novels Animal Farm and 1984.\u2022 Muriel Rukeyser, American poet, war correspondent for the Daily Worker, and other far-left publications.\u2022 J.B.S. Haldane, British scientist and war correspondent.\u2022 Norman Bethune, thoracic surgeon and firebrand Communist, performed hundreds of operations, some in dire conditions. He was nonchalant about danger and would work in the front lines.\u2022 Man Ray, American Dada and surrealist artist, photographer, and filmmaker, documented the War.\u2022 Patience Darton, British nurse with keen initiative, gritty survival, and mental fortitude in tending to the wounded. Fell in love with an ardent Communist soldier\u2014killed in action.\u2022 The International Brigades composed of Western volunteers.Rhodes dedicates many pages to Pablo Picasso and his painting \u201cGuernica.\u201d Picasso was horrified by the German Condor Legion\u2019s bombing and utter destruction of this Basque city on 26 April 1937. The commanding officer of the Condor Legion, Lieutenant Colonel Wolfram von Richthofen, said, \u201cGuernica must be destroyed if we are to strike a blow against the enemy personnel and material.\u201d Joan Mir\u03cc, the Catalan surrealist, painted a large mural titled \u201cCatalan Peasant in Revolt.\u201dRhodes does not include pictures of these art works, and his only overall map of Spain is inadequate. Nonetheless, Hell and Good Company would have an appeal for the literati."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "This was a disappointing read. The book felt like a strange jumble of topics organized in a disjointed manner. The author spends relatively little time on the war itself, more on the experiences of a random assortment of Anglophones. It felt like the subjects were given an outsized place in the war because the author was limited tk English language journals and sources, regardless of whether the subjects he goes on to include had a significant part in the war or not. It was not clear where the book was going but all too obvious that the author was very interested in the mistresses of well known artists and authors.Some interesting vignettes, but overall an unorganized and confusing read."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "In the Preface to Hell and Good Company: The Spanish Civil War and the World It Made, Richard Rhodes writes \u201cThis book only incidentally concerns Spanish politics. . . I was drawn, rather, to the human stories that had not yet been told or had been told only incompletely. I was drawn as well to the technical developments of the war.\u201d The book\u2019s subtitle pledges to paint a picture of \u201cthe World It Made\u201d as well.  Unfortunately, the pages that follow do not deliver on any of these promises.What was the Spanish Civil War really like?Instead of looking at the war through the eyes of its principals \u2014 the soldiers who fought on both sides \u2014 Rhodes devotes the lion\u2019s share of his attention to the outsiders who, in the main, figured on the periphery of the conflict: writers Ernest Hemingway, Andre Malraux, John Dos Passos, Muriel Rukeyser, and George Orwell; journalists Herbert Matthews and Martha Gellhorn; English scientist J. B. S. Haldane; physicians Norman Bethune, Edward Barsky, and Duran Jorda; nurse Patience Darton; and, naturally, Pablo Picasso. Rhodes is particularly enamored of Picasso, occupying page after tedious page with detailed descriptions of the many drafts on paper and canvas that preceded the artist\u2019s seminal work, Guernica. Even Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler receive more attention in the book than any but a tiny handful of Spaniards. Some of this is interesting for the light it casts on the lives and careers of these prominent individuals. The same can\u2019t be said about the lived reality of the half-million people, mostly Spaniards, who died in what has been widely described as the precursor to World War II.Rhodes\u2019 pledge to explore \u201cthe technical developments of the war\u201d falls flat, too. He catalogs the types of aircraft sent to Spain by Germany, Italy, and Russia, and refers to their relative capabilities, but there is little new information about \u201cdevelopments\u201d worthy of the name. He devotes more attention to advances in battlefield medicine: the work of Dr. Bethune and his Catalan counterpart, Dr. Duran Jorda, in introducing and refining a new approach to blood transfusions, which led to \u201cthe world\u2019s first battlefield shipment of preserved blood,\u201d and improvements in triage to focus surgeons on those who could benefit the most from their work.Rhodes gives short shrift to an account of the fighting. Nearly all his attention is focused on the siege and defense of Madrid and on the horrific bombing campaign that leveled Guernica, with an abbreviated account of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion\u2019s participation in the Battle of Jarama.Is all this a case of dishonest packaging \u2014 an inappropriate title and a misleading preface? Perhaps. But no matter how you cut it, Hell and Good Company was a decidedly unbalanced account of the Spanish Civil War.I expected more from Richard Rhodes.About the authorRichard Rhodes deservedly won the Pulitzer Prize in 1988 for The Making of the Atomic Bomb.

This book is NOT a history of the Spanish Civil War per se, despite the subtitle.  In fact, the author announces that fact early on, saying that there is already plenty of other literature pertaining to the military, social and political aspects of the war.  Rather, this is a history (of sorts) of the EFFECTS of the war on developments in technology, art, etc.  It is too long for the slim message it carries; the substance of what it has to say would have made an adequate article for the New Yorker or Harper's.  Frankly, this book is just not very interesting.  I am ashamed to admit that after reading two chapters I found myself skimming the pages and finally gave up the effort of reading at Chapter 4."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The book presumes the reader's general knowledge about the Spanish Civil War.  As the author says in so many words in his introduction, the book is not a comprehensive history of the war but instead comprises accounts by several participants in the conflict and arranges them chronologically.  The accounts are disjointed and range from blood collection and transfusion to the creation of Picasso's Guernica.  The book might appeal to readers already knowledgeable about the war, interested in battlefield medicine, or interested in literary figures of the time, such as Hemingway, Spender, and Orwell.

author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb, \u201cThe most extraordinary book about the Spanish Civil War ever encountered\u201d (The Washington Post).\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939) inspired and haunted an extraordinary number of exceptional artists and writers, including Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\u00f3, Martha Gellhorn, Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, and John Dos Passos. The idealism of the cause\u2014defending democracy from fascism at a time when Europe was darkening toward another world war\u2014and the brutality of the conflict inspired some of their best work: Guernica, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Homage to Catalonia, The Spanish Earth.\r\n\r\nThe war spurred breakthroughs in military and medical technology as well. New aircraft, new weapons, new tactics and strategy all emerged during this time. Progress arose from the horror: the doctors and nurses who volunteered to serve with the Spanish defenders devised major advances in battlefield surgery and frontline blood transfusion. In those ways, and in many others, the Spanish Civil War served as a test bed for World War II, and for the entire twentieth century.\r\n\r\nFrom the life of John James Audubon to the invention of the atomic bomb, readers have long relied on Richard Rhodes to explain, distill, and dramatize crucial moments in history. Now, he takes us into battlefields and bomb shelters, into the studios of artists, into the crowded wards of war hospitals, and into the hearts and minds of a rich cast of characters to show how the ideological, aesthetic, and technological developments that emerged in Spain and changed the world forever. \u201cHell and Good Company is vivid and emotive\u2026thrilling reading\u201d (The Wall Street Journal).", "asin": "1451696221", "rank": "996728", "city": "Barcelona", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B996Aq6iL.jpg", "country": "Spain", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
