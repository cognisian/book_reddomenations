The personalities of the characters are what ultimately draw you into the story and its ultimate finale. I read this after a former vet talked about it on one of the vet forums as being indicative of his experiences in Vietnam, while the Ken Burns miniseries was being debated online...this is definitely a Vet's view of the war, but apparently that of a thinking vet.as much history and personal views of the war are discussed amongst his characters.."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "First, I was never there.
