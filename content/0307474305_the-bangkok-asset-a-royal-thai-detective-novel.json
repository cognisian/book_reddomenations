If you like to read about artificial intelligence gone wrong on an international level, this is the book for you.

On one hand there are a number of interesting, novel and thought provoking ideas and on the other hand, there is a lot of over the top nonsense.  Similarly the plot has some interesting twists and turns and then just meanders off into meh at the end. Perhaps there is a point to this style of story telling but it comes across as poorly edited, rushed and not well executed.  Love the central characters and the setting but this is the least satisfying of the Sonchai series to date."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "If you have not read his novels before this. You should start at the beginning to truly understand Sonchai's spiritual world. These novels are exotic, complex and I canever put them down once I start.

Interesting to learn about Thai customs and beliefs and a great character in Sonjai Jittlecheep.  This particular novel seems to have more than one voice.  It's odd, I don't know much about writing or authors but this seemed to have been written at least in part by someone else, or maybe writers evolve like everything else.

The former monk and devout Buddhist, forever battling to protect his karma from the assaults of morally compromising cases, is now faced with the most horrifying technological innovation to make its way to the streets of Bangkok, and a conspiracy of almost unfathomable reach. \r\n\r\nWith Sonchai on this case is the young female inspector Krom. Like Sonchai, she\u2019s an outsider on the police force, but unlike him, she is socially savvy and a technological prodigy. When they\u2019re called to a demonstration\u2014in the midst of a typhoon\u2014of the deadly, superhuman strength of an American man who is seemingly controlled by a CIA operative, they have no idea what they\u2019re actually witnessing or why. Their reliably obtuse and unequivocally crooked boss, Colonel Vikorn, explains some of it, but the most telling questions remain unanswered: Could the Americans have figured out a way to create a physically and psychologically enhanced supersoldier? Are they testing him\u2014or it\u2014on Thai soil? And why is everyone, from the Bangkok police to the international community, so eager to turn a blind eye? \r\n\r\nSearching for the answers to these questions, Sonchai and Krom find themselves in a remote Cambodian jungle compound for aging American ex-soldiers, where they will discover just how far a government will go to protect its worst secrets\u2014both past and present. But the case will also have much more personal repercussions for Sonchai, shaking his world to its very foundation and perhaps finally forcing him to confront his long-lost American father.\r\n\r\n\u201cBurdett\u2019s fever-dream mysteries, set in Bangkok, recast the police procedural as psychedelic peep show. . . . written with such louche authority that, by the end, one cheers the seemingly infinite multiplicity of Burdett\u2019s universe.\u201d The New Yorker", "asin": "0307474305", "rank": "65748", "city": "Bangkok", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61E9XkPo9WL.jpg", "country": "Thailand", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
