The main character has sexual issues and takes advantage of women but does not feel guilty for his actions. The novel gives a good description of how these scenarios happen and people have many interpretations of whether the women in his life agreed or disagreed to be a part of the experiences. The novel is better than the book because in the movie you cannot tell what his thoughts are and in the novel you can."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great novel, many scenes that elicit strong reactions and the conversations between David and the committee, him and Lucy are thoroughly entertaining and very well conceived"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Such an amazing book, I am glad that my professor chose this book for everyone to read"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Such a really good book by Coetzee very strange and exotic but just being able to read about Davids perspective in sex and love and to see him change as a character very good experience reading this book"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Utterly disappointing...the protagonist has no purpose and the author does not give any plausible basis for the protagonist's (or his daughter) stubbornness.

He held my attention on that account from the first pages, and never failed the expectations I developed then of his writing style. Then the layers of the story were all nicely done, and each element shaped up in the same spare fashion and with the most resonant of words and explanations. I think this book is a masterpiece. The second book of his that I've read, and I've become a big Coetzee fan."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "David Lurie, a university professor in post-apartheid South Africa, will go to almost any length to satisfy his sexual needs, including the seduction of one of his students.  When she charges him with sexual harassment, he is forced out of his job, partly because he shows no real remorse.  He then moves in with his daughter, a lesbian who lives on a small farm.  A tragic and violent event drives home the vulnerability of women in this society and sheds a different light on David\u2019s role as a predator.  This novel made me uncomfortable, particularly with regard to the role reversal between the blacks and the whites.  The blacks have the power, and the whites now find themselves in a world where they are not the bosses.  David\u2019s daughter is more accepting of the new order of things, particularly the lack of law and order, while her father\u2019s frustration festers.  Their opposing attitudes cause a rift between them, and I have to say that, despite his despicable behavior with regard to women, his point of view seems entirely reasonable with regard to his daughter\u2019s safety.  His daughter becomes depressed but ultimately seems willing to absorb some personal losses in order to maintain her quiet life.  Is she courageous or just plain stubborn?  She basically has three choices:  stand up for her rights, accept the situation as is, or leave.  Standing up for her rights could cost her her life, and I think she feels that the whites deserve the treatment they are getting from the blacks anyway.  Turnabout is fair play."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Good book. Bored me a bit."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book ensnares you from page one. Don't expect for a second you know what's in store for David Lurie. A man faced with age and the realities of South Africa and fatherhood, this novel could have been quiet and safe while exploring these themes in David Lurie. Instead, the plot bulldozed over my expectations and left my head spinning to the very end. If you can put down Coetzee's crisp, fast-paced prose, you are stronger willed than me."}]}, "authors": ["J. M.

A heartbreaking novel about a man and his daughter, Disgrace is a portrait of the new South Africa that is ultimately about grace and love.\r\n\r\nAt fifty-two Professor David Lurie is divorced, filled with desire but lacking in passion. An affair with one of his students leaves him jobless and friendless. Except for his daughter, Lucy, who works her smallholding with her neighbor, Petrus, an African farmer now on the way to a modest prosperity. David's attempts to relate to Lucy, and to a society with new racial complexities, are disrupted by an afternoon of violence that changes him and his daughter in ways he could never have foreseen.
