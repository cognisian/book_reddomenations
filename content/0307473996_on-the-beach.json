Being young during the late 50's and 60's , having fear of Nuclear War, it was a good reminder how WISE men avoided the \"dogs of war\".

The characters in the movie were better developed and brilliantly acted.  If you were looking for a more expanded version of the story, the book version was very disappointing,. The book is not bad, after all, Nevil  Shute did some great work. I like Stanley Kramer's movies and this one is a master piece. The book, by comparison is interesting, but not compelling. The movie celebrates a beautiful romantic love story in the middle of a worldwide catastrophe and some measure of human redemption. The book, on the other hand, is simply dark (Get the movie)....."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent portrayal of the emotions, viewed through the eyes of the characters, facing the horror and results of  a world devastated by nuclear war.

Among them is an American submarine captain struggling to resist the knowledge that his wife and children in the United States must be dead. Then a faint Morse code signal is picked up, transmitting from somewhere near Seattle, and Captain Towers must lead his submarine crew on a bleak tour of the ruined world in a desperate search for signs of life. \r\n\r\nBoth terrifying and intensely moving, On the Beach is a remarkably convincing portrait of how ordinary people might face the most unimaginable nightmare.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe most haunting evocation we have of a world dying of radiation after an atomic war.\u201d The New York Times ", "asin": "0307473996", "rank": "45873", "city": "Melbourne", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51zglauEpDL.jpg", "country": "Australia", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
