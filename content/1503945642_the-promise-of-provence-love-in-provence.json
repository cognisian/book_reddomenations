Read it with Google handy to look up all the areas mentioned in the story. The descriptions of the areas visited in the book were very inviting and created a desire within me to go to Provence."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The descriptions of France were interesting, but there was too much useless information not pivotal to the story that made the story drag.  The mother's story was the highlight of the book.  The character development was non existent and the main character seemed too much of a Pollyanna for me.  It irritated me that she just let the guy at the hotel off the hook."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent romance with a travel guide of Provence. This author not only has a well developed story, but also describes the places in Toronto and Provence so well that one feels as if they are there as part of the scenery. The characters are mature adults in believable relationships. It is exciting to escape to previously unknown destinations. I borrowed this book from my local library."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Finally! A romance that was so relatable. And such a beautiful place to be taken to. It made me feel like life is far from over just because you\u2019re over 30. I am definitely going to any number of the places described in this novel and on top of that, I will be buying a lot of wine and cheese! Going to look into the Home exchange too."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "such a powerful, real story! i felt i was a part of the story of pain, new love and happiness."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Couldn't put the book down.Felt every emotion of the main character!!Looking forward to book 2."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "It's a really slow read but the historical facts of France are great.

Not only traveling the globe, but I also have traveled the path of several losses and having to create new identities through each journey. The author has done a great job in conveying it in the story.What was so enjoyable about the book were the descriptions of the villages in Provence and later in the story; the descriptions of the Antibes area. The descriptions of S. France assisted giving the story more depth & color.The issues of loss, renewal of identity, and friendships were dealt with and written in a realistic manners. Also loved, that the story continued to develop and did not just stop, as a lot of other authors have done in the writing of their stories.Kudos to you, Patricia!
