The Girl from Venice twists the story of a Jewish girl adrift in Italy during the last days of WWII.  While fishing, Cenzo discovers Giulia.  Cenzo must now hide Giulia and find someone to take her to safety as the Germans are herding Jews and killing them.  Martin Cruz Smith captures the beauty of the sea, the fish, and the art of fishing in this story of love.  Many authors concentrate on the hardships of the war and the terrible events that happen, but Smith glides over all the tragedies.  Of course, the jealousy among brothers permeates the story, but in the end, Cenzo follows his heart and conscience."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I've read Gorky Park and Polar Star and this pales in many ways.
