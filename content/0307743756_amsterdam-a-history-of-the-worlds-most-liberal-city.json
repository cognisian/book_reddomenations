He explores how Amsterdam became one of the World's Most Liberal City, and how it spread this influence, especially in the United States. People of Amsterdam (and most of Holland) gained the land from the sea, not received it from higher authorities, and thus feudalism system never managed to root here. Water management required cooperation, which result in a very interesting combination of individualism and communitarism. While Protestant ethics opened the way to getting rich, community always discouraged excessive show off, and the city never ghettoized. Author praise Amsterdam tolerance, in its very specific and pragmatic form.I find most interesting chapters covering late 19th-early 20th century history, and one covering 1960s to modern days. It is interesting to see how Holland managed to find the third way, without going to full fledged revolution, and without allowing unchecked capitalism reign. The later, tells interesting story of counter-culture movement and complexity of politics in modern days Amsterdam."}]}, "authors": ["Russell Shorto"], "isbn": "0307743756", "longitude": 4.8936041, "periods": ["1600s", "1700s", "1800s", "1900s", "2000s"], "title": "Amsterdam: A History of the World's Most Liberal City", "word_cloud": "great entertaining historical survey people well write finish pretty dull trouble get back change mind finish revise review great very well write so interesting vacation airport buy fascinate well write csptivsting very good summary really much title suggest find fun fascinate story general particular friends reader say get quite right give enough insight fascinate story make analysis section seem bit simplistic perhaps bias american perspective look enjoyable able take analysis offer voice wiser one learn tiny nation huge significance enjoy tell way huh compile nice readable early modern day explore become spread influence especially gain land sea receive higher authority thus feudalism system never manage root management require cooperation result interest combination individualism communitarism protestant ethic open way get rich community always discourage excessive show never ghettoize praise tolerance specific pragmatic find interesting chapter cover late century cover modern day interest see manage third way go full fledge revolution allow unchecked capitalism reign later tell interest story movement complexity politics modern day amsterdam", "genres": ["History"], "summary": "An endlessly entertaining portrait of the city of Amsterdam and the ideas that make it unique, by the author of the acclaimed Island at the Center of the World\r\n\r\nTourists know Amsterdam as a picturesque city of low-slung brick houses lining tidy canals; student travelers know it for its legal brothels and hash bars; art lovers know it for Rembrandt's glorious portraits.\r\n\r\nBut the deeper history of Amsterdam, what makes it one of the most fascinating places on earth, is bound up in its unique geography-the constant battle of its citizens to keep the sea at bay and the democratic philosophy that this enduring struggle fostered. Amsterdam is the font of liberalism, in both its senses. Tolerance for free thinking and free love make it a place where, in the words of one of its mayors, \"craziness is a value.\" But the city also fostered the deeper meaning of liberalism, one that profoundly influenced America: political and economic freedom. Amsterdam was home not only to religious dissidents and radical thinkers but to the world's first great global corporation.\r\n\r\nIn this effortlessly erudite account, Russell Shorto traces the idiosyncratic evolution of Amsterdam, showing how such disparate elements as herring anatomy, naked Anabaptists parading through the streets, and an intimate gathering in a sixteenth-century wine-tasting room had a profound effect on Dutch-and world-history. Weaving in his own experiences of his adopted home, Shorto provides an ever-surprising, intellectually engaging story of Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n\u201cRich and eventful. . . .
