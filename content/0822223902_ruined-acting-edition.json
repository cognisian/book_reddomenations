The establishment\u2019s shrewd matriarch, Mama Nadi, keeps peace between customers from both sides of the civil war, as government soldiers and rebel forces alike choose from her inventory of women, many already \u201cruined\u201d by rape and torture when they were pressed into prostitution. Inspired by interviews she conducted in Africa with Congo refugees, Nottage has crafted an engrossing and uncommonly human story with humor and song served alongside its postcolonial and feminist politics in the rich theatrical tradition of Bertolt Brecht\u2019s Mother Courage.\r\n\r\n\u201cAn intense and gripping new drama . . . the kind of new play we desperately need: well-informed and unafraid of the world\u2019s brutalities. Nottage is one of our finest playwrights, a smart, empathetic and daring storyteller who tells a story an audience won\u2019t expect.\u201d Time Out New York", "asin": "0822223902", "rank": "395862", "city": "Kinshasa", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41WAGdloJ5L.jpg", "country": "DR Congo", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
