Everything one could possibly want to know about Trieste, a tapestry of great beauty! A fascinating book that I could not put down..."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": ",that is, Trieste, which is the \u201cepitome of Mitteleuropa \u2013 of Europe distilled, as it were.\u201d So wrote Jan Morris, who started life as James Morris, about one of those delightful \u201cniche\u2019\u2019 places on the map, whose original purpose has long been superseded. Can the purpose for its existence be \u201cre-invented\u201d? Morris cites similar other places, like Danzig or Tangiers. I thought of an air force base in eastern New Mexico that was given three years to find a purpose for its existence, or it would be closed down. (Sure enough, they found one!)Trieste was founded as the port city for the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was dissolved at the end of World War I. Its natural hinterland was present day Czech, Slovakia, Hungary, et al. Morris identifies 1897 as the imperial high water mark, when the band played the Radetzky March in the Plaza, of which only hints of its former grandeur remain (I listened to the March on YouTube trying to obtain a feeling for that time.) On the edge of three ethnic \u201ctectonic plates,\u201d Slav, German and Italian, the city truly has been a political football. It took \u201cthe world\u201d almost a decade after the Second World War to decide what to do with it: should it be part of Yugoslavia, an Independent City, or part of Italy? The last won out, so the city found itself at the far eastern end of \u201cnowhere,\u201d cut off from its hinterland by the \u201cIron Curtain.\u201dMorris provides an outstanding historical narrative of Trieste during the days of the Empire. She relates how Guglielmo Oberdan, who fled Austrian conscription, and became an Italian, returned to Trieste in an unsuccessful effort to kill the Emperor, Franz Joseph, in 1882. It was a precursor of the ethnic hatreds that led to the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which would commence World War I. Of particular interest are her descriptions of the writers who found nurture in Trieste, in particular, James Joyce, who wrote\u00a0A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man\u00a0there. She is less complementary concerning another fellow traveler and writer, Sir Richard Burton, who ended his days there as a British Consular official. Of personal interest, I had just read and reviewed my first book written by John Berger. Morris quotes from Berger\u2019s novel \u201cG,\u201d about a doctor who could not speak the language of his patients with the rationale: \u201c\u2026 a cow didn\u2019t have to explain its symptoms to a vet.\u201d A memorable quip that encapsulates ethnic contempt.Morris provides thoughtful description of the natural world in which Trieste is set, the harbor, and the high stony infertile Karst that dominates its background. She also describes the Istria peninsula, just to the south of Trieste, which once had a significant Italian population that had to relocate after WWII, as this peninsula was allocated to Yugoslavia.The lead review on this book, published in 2002, entitled \u201cTrieste Mia\u201d gives some useful insights into the city from another who lived there. The review said that Morris viewed the city with far too much melancholy, and I would agree. Morris appears to have always been alone there, which might account for this outlook. Trieste might be better seen with a friend, though I\u2019m not sure \u201cTrieste is for lovers\u201d is an expression that has gained tractions. I remain impressed with Morris\u2019 erudition, and insights into one of those fascinating places in the world where different forces collide. I thank a fellow Amazon reviewer for this excellent recommendation. 5-stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "The author tries to use as many big, unrelated words as possible in every sentence.

I read the book in part because Trieste was one of the most productive literary locations for Sir Richard Burton, one of my exploration heroes, and it was the city of his passing.  I have also traveled throughout this region in recent years and am fascinated by the confluence of eastern and western Christianity, and Islam.Morris brings this all together in her interpretation of Trieste as a \"city of nowhere\", because its glory seems to be all in the past; which has become a \"city for everyone\", a riff on Pico Iyer's \"Global Soul\".  I loved her comparison of an aged Trieste with those of us who are aging people, wherein both this city and us septuagenarians come to realize that one of the things that matters most in life is simply being kind to other people, which she observes is a singular quality of the denizens of Trieste.This is a thoughtful, intelligent, loving story of a place dear to the heart of Ms Morris.
