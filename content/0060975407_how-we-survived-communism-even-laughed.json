The book includes some interesting and telling stories and the author relates them well.  Unfortunately, it is overly peppered with her extreme feminism, revulsion with religion, and her anti-westernism, which ends up being criticized almost as much as the communist system itself.  Still, if you can tolerate those aspects, some of the stories of daily life under communism are worth a look, especially those of chapters 1-5."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A great window into every day life under communism.

Sometimes one gets the impression that the author derives pleasure from painting a picture that was never that bad in old Yugoslavia. Why insist on comparing countries that were so different even in those days? Why dwell on unsavoury details about Golub loo-paper or the communist version of Tampaxes? They do nothing to help the reader understand the bygone era of so-called Communism.

Provocative, often witty, and always intensely personal, How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed cracks open a paradoxical world that through its rejection of capitalism and commoditization ends up fetishizing both.\r\n\r\nExamining the relationship between material goods and expressions of happiness and individuality in a society where even bananas were an alien luxury, Drakulic homes in on the eradication of female identity, drawing on her own experiences as well as broader cultural observations. Enforced communal housing that allowed for little privacy, the banishment of many time-saving devices, and a focus on manual labor left no room for such bourgeois affectations as cosmetics or clothes, but Drakulic\u2019s remarkable exploration of the reality behind the rhetoric reveals that women still went to desperate lengths to feel \u201cfeminine.\u201d\r\n\r\nHow We Survived Communism and Even Laughed also chronicles the lingering consequences of such regimes. The Berlin Wall may have fallen, but Drakulic\u2019s power pieces testify that ideology cannot be dismantled so quickly; a lifetime lived in fear cannot be so easily forgotten.", "asin": "0060975407", "rank": "38101", "city": "Berlin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41cnHIHX33L.jpg", "country": "Germany", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
