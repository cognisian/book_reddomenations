And William Ireland: employed in his family bookshop and, like Mary, feeling downtrodden by his parent. Until one day he comes into possession of some writings, including unpublished works,by Shakespeare...Although the Lambs and Ireland never actually had any dealings with one another, this makes for a great read that really transports you back to London of that era."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Peter Ackroyd does it again!

Loved reading about life in 19th century England."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "\"The future is as nothing, being everything\u2026The past is everything, being nothing.\"Peter Ackroyd's \"Lambs of London\" is a fictionalized account of the 18th century hoax that 'discovered' lost works of Shakespeare. When a widow discovers that her late husband had a house full of old documents, she allows a young bookseller's son named William Ireland to take inventory and keep anything he deems of value. Inside the treasure trove are dozens of documents belonging to the Bard himself - including several lost plays. When the first play is staged, it is not exactly a success. But while Ireland has several experts who can vouch for the documents' authenticity, others are skeptical. He is, after all, reluctant to name the woman whose home he discovered them in, and is determined to keep other experts away from the documents themselves.Ireland has made friends with a set of siblings, Charles and Mary Lamb, who live with their ailing parents a few blocks from his father's bookstore. Mary, in particular, is enamored with everything Shakespeare, and when popular opinion starts to turn against Ireland and his \"found\" plays, she is determined to support him no matter what. But when the true origin of the plays is determined, it has disastrous results for the Lamb family.Is \"The Lambs of London\" a great literary masterpiece? No. It's interesting, a diversion, a way of looking at the possibilities behind an historic event. I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you're a lover of anything Shakespeare, but it's a nice little read."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Ackroyd is a historical novelist & Shakespearean scholar.  With all the current hoaxes floating around out there of fiction masquerading as memoirs & authors claiming to be who they are not; he has chosen to write a novel about an actual hoax or rather is this a true account of a hoax that did happen or is this a fictional account of a historical hoax which never happened. In any event, in this slim volume of just over 200+ pages, the author humors the readers by showing the intricacies of literary hoaxes & deceits.  Of course, such hoaxes depend on greed.  The same emotion which is needed for scams & hoaxes to work in the present day. Here we have a son hoping to climb out of his father's suffocating shadow.  The son is only 19.  Who in the world would think him capable of falsely writing a long lost & newly discovered Shakespeare play or poem.  Yet, he claims to have found such items.  His willing dupes are his greedy father, a young aspiring journalist, the journalist's homely sister, some inexpert experts, greedy publishers & a willingly gullible public.  Even the reader is taken in, for awhile. The young man, William Ireland, keeps much counsel with himself & finally with Mary Lamb.  Eventually, he lets out too much & soon enough the cat is out of the bag. The hoax is revealed.  Or was it really a hoax to begin with?  Was this a retelling of historical fact or a totally made up hoax?  Maybe, one can Goggle the answer; but leaving it up to the imagination sounds more exciting."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Got to p68 and nearly threw up at the completely out-of-the-blue, unnecessary description of the sexual molestation of an abandoned child. WT??? I'm sick of books that take the terrible, shame-to-all-humanity Catholic Priests' sex scandal and make it into ALL clergy for ALL of history have to molest children. Disgusting, wanton act by an irresponsible author wanting to be very pseduo-PC. RUINED an otherwise fun book. This sort of thing belongs ONLY in memoirs of those who suffered it."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "N.B.: FOR ANYONE NOT ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE STORY OF MARY LAMB AND OF WILLIAM IRELAND, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A SPOILER.In a note at the beginning Peter Ackroyd gives fair warning that `This is not a biography but a work of fiction.  I have invented characters, and changed the life of the Lamb family for the sake of the larger narrative.'  I do not myself object to fictionalized biography so long as it credibly fills in details of speech or incident, does not depart too far from what is known, and does not deliberately contradict what actually happened.  Ackroyd credibly invents speech and the incidents of daily life; but in the depiction of the relationship between Mary Lamb (whose life is well documented) and William Henry Ireland (ditto) he invents a connection for which there is no historical warrant; and in the case of the Shakespearian scholar Edmond Malone and in the dates he gives he runs directly counter to the known facts.  This may not trouble most readers; but it irritated me and considerably reduced my appreciation of what is a well-told tale, with the atmosphere and the literary scene of late 18th century London being knowledgeably conveyed with Ackroyd's usual skill and light touch.The novel gives us a good picture of the principal characters: of Mary Lamb and her brother Charles; of their parents; and of William Ireland and his father Samuel, a bookseller and collector of historical memorabilia.  Mary is very close to Charles; she is at times mentally disturbed, and is driven mad by having to attend on her old father, who has lost his mind and whose talk is completely inconsequential, and on her controlling old mother.Brother and sister are devoted to the works of Shakespeare; and that makes for the invented bond with William Ireland, who claimed to have discovered a hoard of Shakespearian manuscripts, including a hitherto unknown play, `Vortigern'.  He had forged them all;  but he fooled his father, Mary, Edmond Malone (in historical fact it was Malone who exposed the forgeries) and many others into believing in their authenticity.  This is the spoiler referred to at the top of this review.  The reader who does not already know of the forgeries will, when reading this novel, be as taken in by the charm and enthusiasm of William Fielding as were, for a while, so many others.Those readers who already know the dreadful deed Mary Lamb committed will yet be surprised by what Ackroyd produces as the trigger for it. The final chapter contains a few more deliberate conflicts with the historical facts, for no artistic reason that I can make out."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I'm not a scholar of Shakespeare nor historic England, but I found the combination of a book that delved into Shakespeare and life 200 years ago to be an irresistable combination.  In this novel, author PEter Ackroyd takes a true event -- the forgery of some Shakespeare letters, poems, and a play -- and brings the perpetrators and other early 19th-century Shakespearians to life.For me, the most entertaining thing was to try to inhabit the minds of people who literally seemed to have Shakespeare at-hand in their everyday speech and perception.  They could quote him as easily as we'd quote lines from a sitcom or commercial.  And \"they\" were not necessarily scholars and children of nobility.  These were shopkeepers and clerks -- but with ambitions, intelligence, and intensity.  I'd like to think that I would have been able to do so, if I had been raised in that environment, too.The pace of the story never slackens.  We first meet Mary Lamb (an old maid, destined to care for her senile father) and Charles Lamb (her brother, a clerk with the East India company who dreams of glory as a literary critic and essayist). Since childhood, these two have been close, and they have shared a love of language and intellectual conversation.  While Mary is house-bound, due to the restrictions of her era, Charles works and goes drinking with his friends several night a week.  He's found a boisterous, reasonably literate crew of pals, and they respect the small articles he's been able to place in literary publications.  Charles meets -- or rather, is baited by -- William Ireland, an ambitious and possibly genius 17-year-old son of a bookseller.  Ireland begins to share with William and Mary a series of Shakespeare pieces -- a letter, a poem -- that he has forged.  When these are declared by scholars to be genuine, William presents his greatest forgery: an entire play.  The play is produced, and it's met with derision and closes in six nights, as, perhaps, the public senses that it's not really Shakespeare.  The forgeries unravel, and lives unravel.  Ironically, William did it to impress his father and to test his literary skills, but not for glory or money (which are the reasons his father pursued the verification to its ultimate failure).The author does a deft job of sketching scenes and then leaving them before you get everything you want.  You want to hear more from Charles' cronies, who are witty and foolish at the same time.  You want the mini-play that Charles tries to produce to be done more than once (in front a inmates in an asylum).  You want Mary and William to fall in love and read plays and poetry together for 40 years.  You want Charles to achieve his ambition as a literary critic.  And so on.The only clunker in this book is a two-page visit that William and his father make to a pair of clerics who are Shakespeare scholars, and who become crucial to the deception because they are pleased that the newly found works \"prove\" that Shakespeare was not a secret Catholic.  Those clerics are described as owning a black foundling boy, a former slave, who they molest every night.  It's a dumb, unnecessary detail -- as neither the clerics nor the boy appear again in the book.  So why does the author go out of his way to make those insults?"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I didn't care for this book at all.  Too speculative, and the characters were not especially likable."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "In the enthralling (literary fiction) historical novel, The Lambs of London, scribed by renowned British novelist and biographer Peter Ackroyd, the author hooks his readers on the discovery of a new dramatic script that might have been William Shakespeare's unknown literary treasure.Set in London of the Romantic Period (late eighteenth/early nineteenth century), the novel gives a fictitious account of how Charles and Mary Lamb make acquaintance with a young bookseller who claims to have found Shakespeare's yet unknown work. The enthusiasm and skepticism that follow make this story a captivating read.The author tells you upfront that the situations are purely fictitious. The real historical figures like the Lambs, Thomas de Quincey, and R.B. Sheridan only support the ambience of the literary environment of London at the time of the novel's events. However, the incorporation of these characters provides solid grounds for performing this literary march in which the name of Shakespeare leads the lives of its followers.As the plot unfolds through the forays of William Ireland into Shakespeare's world, readers get a chance to take a close look at London life that is blanketed by ennui and unanimity at large. For the middle-class literary figures and businessmen dealing in books, Shakespeare's name signifies a boom that would shake people out of their dormancy. Whether it is turns out to their good or ruin is the point illustrated so cogently in the book's ending.Peter Ackroyd proves to be skilled at `showing' instead of `telling' about a historical situation. As manifest in The Lambs of London, he shows how history can be created and made credible. However, the title of his novel calls critical thought to questioning of its relevance. William Ireland remains the dominant character in the story and precedes the Lambs in both attention and character development. The book's ending, though, makes it a story of the Lambs for a moment.Armchair Interviews says: Ackroyd's novel is definitely a memorable creation for lovers of literary fiction."}]}, "authors":
