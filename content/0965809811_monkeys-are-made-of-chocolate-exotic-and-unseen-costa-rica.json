The author is passionate about his subject and is a talented story teller.  If you've had the opportunity to travel to Costa Rica, the stories in this book will resonate strongly as many of the animals and nature described in this book are typically Costa Rican and difficult to avoid when you are there.  The stories are written with a friendly and funny narrative tone which draws in the reader. Also the short chapters in the book each devoted to an animal or natural phenomenon allow readers to gain a wide and varied exposure to many subjects.  I've been to Costa Rica on two occasions, and reading this book motivates me to return and discover some of the natural wonders I've yet had a chance to see. This is a fascinating read!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I met Jack Ewing during a recent trip to Costa Rica.... he's obviously passionate about helping the reemergence of the bio corridors in Central America.

We've been on the Carribean side of Costa Rica twice, but after reading this book, I definitely want to visit the southwestern part of Costa Rica too.
