A co-worker of mine forced it into my hands so I had no choice: this is one I had to read.Though I didn't know much about it going in, it pretty much read how I thought it would. It was a fast read, and though I was unsure whether I would end up liking it the end sealed it for me. Reading it made me think of Next Life Might Be Kinder by Howard Norman or A Certain Matter by Kenzaburo Oe. The ending so much made me think of The Heart Keeper by Francoise Sagan, one of the best books I've read this year and now on my favorites shelf. Except her book is short, weird, funny as well.But overall, a good read. I won't ever revisit it, but I enjoyed it."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "This book was just confusing and made little sense"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "If you need to love the main character and feel good about the ending in order to love the book, this book isn\u2019t for you. It was fascinating and a little unsettling to like and sympathize with the narrator at the start, only to start questioning your own judgement as the book progresses. Also, as a side note, don\u2019t bother watching the movie version. It strays very far from the book and is poorly done."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Not a fan.

Not a single likable character.  Don\u2019t think the ending was a shock."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Okay, whoa. This one was a doozy. It was not what I was expecting, in a good way. Every single character in this book is perfectly unlikeable as their most common traits are selfishness, opportunism and the ability to rationalize a litany of poor choices. The Dinner was dark and twisted and only got darker and more twisted as the page numbers increased. I think one of the reasons the actions and thoughts of the characters in the book are hard to swallow is that they\u2019re all fairly realistic actions and thoughts. Everything in this book could have happened. And it\u2019s in those small reactions and actions, and millisecond thoughts portrayed by the characters, in which you witness the devil in all of us. This book can be read in a sitting or two, and should be if possible, in order to be properly digested. It\u2019s a wild ride through a hellish dinner with an entree of dark secrets and a dessert of violence. When you close the book, be prepared to sit for a moment - it\u2019ll take a moment or two to hit your stomach."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Would not recommend this book.
