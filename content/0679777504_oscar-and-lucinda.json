Honestly, the out-&-out rubbish that gets you into Heaven these days! I don't know if it's an English or a Taurean thing; but this book is just absolute drivel from start to ... half-way (well, YOU finish it)! It's right down there with Tim Winton's 'Cloudstreet'.

Some authors seem to regard an unhappy ending as more true-to-life than a happy one. But they can feel equally arbitrary unless they are 'earned' by the characters. This unhappy ending comes out of nowhere. The author just felt like yanking the rug out from under the readers' feet, I guess.The plot is also extremely slow; it's not until about halfway through that Oscar and Lucinda even meet.I will give Carey this -- his prose is good enough that I kept reading despite the lack of action."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I just didn't love it.

Author seems to be trying to impress the reader with his detailed observations of human idiosynchrosies.  Quirky is a word I'd use to describe the style.
