I don't think its going out on a limb to suggest that a good number of people find Banks somewhat polarizing at times, beyond the cheeky rascals that populate his novels and almost wilful desire to avoid anything resembling a conventional resolution you have his sometimes bizarre situations which coupled with a tendency toward a fairly unapologetically leftward political view either makes for embracing you as a brother or thinking that your novels are only thinly veiled political screeds, sometimes with spaceships.This generally isn't a problem for me with most of his novels and didn't particularly bother me here but the \"political screed\" crowd received plenty of fuel for that fire when Banks made his protagonist a smug, atheist shock jock (or whatever they call them in England) who seems prone to not knowing when the microphone isn't near him and constantly regales his friends and even strangers with long rants on his politics.  In between those, the plot happens.  Needless to say, this isn't for the Banks novice.I think a lot of people (and the cover copy leans toward that initial view) were sucked in by the idea that this was going to be a novel dealing with the British view of the World Trade Center attack and the book does seem to go out of its way to encourage that, between the creepy cover featuring two tall smokestacks with a plane drifting ominously past them and the opening scene where our narrator Ken Nott is at a wedding party that is going swingingly just as news of the attack reaches England and suddenly no one is really all that keen on dessert.But beyond that, the book doesn't really address the attack except obliquely or when used as a springboard for one of Ken's political lectures, which on some level makes sense . . . happening in another country across the ocean and with no one he knows getting killed, Ken's take seems to be \"everyone is getting worked up over this but worse stuff is happening every day around the world\", which is both true and slightly callous and sometimes suggests to me that Banks is doing a satire on the seriousness and occasionally pomposity of other novels that focus on the attacks (I thought Pynchon's \"Bleeding Edge\" dealt with it well but I may be alone on that) by showing life going on as normal by people too far away to be directly affected by it.And what is \"life going on as normal\" mean for a popular shock jock?  Mostly hanging out with your friends, toeing the line between satisfying and ticking off your employers and when the mood strikes you cheating on your girlfriend with a married woman (which is okay because she might be doing it too), among other things.  All of this transpires in a fairly aimless fashion, which may be my biggest complaint about the book is that it drifts along for long enough that you start to wonder \"where exactly are we going with this?\"  And given that the book reads fairly quickly, you may be a lot further along than you'd like before you realize that you've done nothing but hang out with a left wing narcissist in perhaps a vain search for the plot.A lot of this thus depends on either a) the charisma of the narrator or b) the likability of the supporting cast.  And that's . . . iffy?  Nott as a narrator as the usual witty voice of a Banks protagonist and there is some glee is seeing him constantly skewer people and still walk away thinking he's right all the time.  The peeks into the radio show will probably put people off the most as many seem to interpret it as Banks forcing his politics on the unsuspecting reader.  Its quite possible that he and Nott shared similar political views . . . I haven't read many interviews with Banks but judging from other books of his I've read it seems to fall in line with sentiments expressed elsewhere.  However, I do believe that Banks was too good a writer to simply make a character a mouthpiece for his personal views solely for the purpose of forcing it on us.  I suspect he was trying to depict the difference between how Nott perceives himself versus what everyone else thinks of him and there's a brief scene later in the book where another character calls him on his fearless contrarian warrior self-view by basically suggesting that maybe the rich guy who owns the radio station keeps him around because his antics distract everyone from the more objectionable stuff they're doing.  Getting caught up in the politics themselves misses the point, its about a guy so confident in his ability to know and see everything, to live his life purely by own unassailable principles that when his weaknesses start to call the proverbial chickens home to roost they might as well all be wearing tiny mirrors around their necks so he can see himself for what he really is.However, as a caveat, I will note that my personal politics and Nott's overlap in a couple of areas so I couldn't get too offended (plus his whole shtick is pissing people off so its supposed to be over the top) but even the stuff I was disagreed had entertainment value.  Plus I can't get too mad when fictional characters say things I don't like, mostly because they're not real.  There are plenty of people saying offensive things in real life that I can expend energy on getting mad at instead.So to me the real test is: is it boring?  It's not, mostly because in how fast it reads but with the cast populated with people who you will feel either neutral toward or actively dislike, you're not going to get too attached to anyone.  The main thrust of the plot seems to eventually cohere around Ken's affair with the married woman, who in typical Banks fashion goes out of her way to make this as unconventional as possible, meeting him randomly at hotels and announcing her intentions via a key sent in the mail.  Oh, and she's married to a crimeboss.  This seems to be the conflict that the novel hangs itself on, waiting for the other shoe to drop as Ken goes about his days making everyone mad at him and supremely confident that none of that will come back to bite him.When it does the results show off Banks' talents probably better than any other portion of the book.  Although what leads up to it is ludicrous and the solution even more insane he does an excellent job of turning what amounts to a breaking and entering job into a nail biter of an affair, ratcheting up the tension to the point where it actively starts to make you nervous.  Later on a confrontation is also almost unbearably tense where you're waiting to see Ken taken down a peg but not wanting him to be eviscerated and thrown into a woodchipper either.Still, the payoff to all that felt flat to me, a tacked on happy ending that makes you wonder what the whole point of the rest of the book was.  Presumably Banks couldn't bring himself to show an extremely confident and arrogant man eventually learning how to be a warm and cuddly person since that suggests levels of sentiment that aren't usually his forte (plus, as real life shows us, its not all that realistic since when the arrogant get taken down they tend to blame everyone else for their failings) . . . so I give him kudos for not going with the obvious crowd pleasing route or even the more cynical realistic route.  What we do get is some uncomfortable blend of the two that doesn't quite feel earned based on what we've read before, its not a really satisfying conclusion but neither does it make me go \"Oh Iain Banks you lovably contrary Scotsman\".Maybe its been a while since I've read a Banks novel (I'm pretty sure this is my first since he died a few years ago) or maybe he was making some point about society that we've either moved past (the book was published in 2002, which in today's world feels like fifty years ago . . . these days the shock jock would just restrict his opinions to tweeting) or I'm too dense to get or maybe he was never able to zero in on exactly what he was trying to say (or thought it was more obvious than it turned out to be).  As I mentioned earlier, its definitely not for the Banks novice and while it does have its small pleasures there are somewhat small this time indeed.  Even if you don't like spaceship laden Iain Banks, he has plenty of straight fiction that works better than this.  Read it if you've read everything else (especially as we're not about to get anything new from him) but certainly you can safely tuck it pretty far down the reading order."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "A very sexist book in a way that you won't expect from the rest of its very liberal content, or from the fact it was actually written in the 21st century.

The book\u2019s Scots hero Ken Nott (35) never shuts up. He is a radio DJ,  rarely lasting a year in earlier radio jobs for his controversial take on the world. Now he is a true shock jock upsetting listeners from a London commercial radio station just before and after 9/11, 2001. In the quite cinematic first chapters, Ken emerges as an early detractor of  the UK going to war in Iraq and Afghanistan.Ken\u2019s dialogues with his best Scottish friend Craig, his black club DJ buddy Ed and his producer Phil (on air and in the pub) are quite ok. So are excerpts from his phone-in late morning radio show reproduced in many chapters. It shows him as what the French call a \u2018r\u00e2leur\u2019, a contrarian moaner about persons, political parties, countries, religions, etc.,  but also about the perils of riding a bike in London. He likes to be labeled a militant Liberal and has his own wall of fame with framed  first complaints, death threats and other negative job-related trophies. Another aspect of his radio career is his being Scottish, which is highlighted off and on air,  to some delight to this reader.What propels the novel forward is his professed love for his three friends and for the real, female kind. Ken was married once and has been quite opportunistic and successful since.  Until he meets beautiful Celia, married to a ruthless crime boss, whose many businesses have almost become mainstream\u2026  No more from this reader about their affair, which dominates much of the book.Weaknesses: (1) Iain Banks, not an economical writer by nature or choice, wrote chapters that are way too long for me; (2)  Found  Ken not someone to bond with as the story progressed, and  (3)  Banks\u2019 increasing concern with Ken\u2019s thoughts and fears led me to skip, or read in a FFW-way the more action-packed second half.Many fantastic bits cannot undo later tedium.

Nonetheless, I have to be honest.I hadn\u2019t read anything by Iain Banks for some years, I enjoyed The Wasp Factory, The Crow Road and Complicity. I wasn\u2019t so keen on Whit so drifted away a bit.Then I recently picked up Dead Air.I don\u2019t like to give up on books and I didn\u2019t on this one. I came close. I think it was about page 160 before anything actually happened.There\u2019s no real plot, which doesn\u2019t have to be a problem; books can be character-driven. This is when I got puzzled, though. I know I shouldn\u2019t spend all my time wondering about the author\u2019s intentions, but I can\u2019t help it \u2013 or at least not when I can\u2019t lose myself in the book. I couldn\u2019t decide and I still can\u2019t whether Iain Banks was setting out, in Ken (the hero), to portray an opinionated, hypocritical, misogynistic, puerile pillock who seemed to think he was smart and cool, but was about as cool as boiling water, or whether he actually did think that Ken was quite a hip, trendy, happening kind of a guy.I\u2019d like to hope the former, but I fear it\u2019s the latter, given the ring of sincerity about so much of what comes out of Ken\u2019s mouth and head (and there\u2019s soooo much of it, regardless of how well it\u2019s written, that I was yawning and skipping).I guess the book is supposed to be some satire of early 21st Century Britain, of which Ken is no doubt supposed to be a symptom, but Banks seems too drunk on his own verbosity for it to really work. Yes, there were some amusing moments, and some interesting points made, but he does go on, and on, and on. Nothing is too trivial for Ken\u2019s attention, from minor league Scottish football teams to vibrating phones as sex aids (!). Enough now, or I\u2019ll know I\u2019ve been infected.
