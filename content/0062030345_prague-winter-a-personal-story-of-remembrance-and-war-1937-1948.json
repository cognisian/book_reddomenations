This significantly reduces its value as a work of history.In 1918 the victors of WW1 decided that the multi-ethnicity of Austria-Hungary was a \u201cproblem\u201d that needed to be resolved by granting \u201cself-determination\u201d to the country\u2019s minorities. What most historians have failed to explain is how the creation of a miniature version of the old Austria-Hungary in the form of a new \u201cCzecho-Slovakia\u201d could possibly have been seen as part of a reasonable solution to this \u201cproblem\u201d. Albright\u2019s book also ignores this question.The creation of the new \u201cCzecho-Slovakia\u201d was promoted by a handful of Czech nationalists, in large part through subterfuge and fraud, to the post-WW1 power brokers (France, Britain and the U.S.) who were more than willing to listen to, and sanction, any scheme that would suit their goal of limiting German influence in Europe. It did not seem to matter that the case of \u201cCzecho-Slovakia\u201d would have no effect on Germany itself, but rather only serve to compromise the ethnic German minority of the former Hapsburg empire. It did not seem to matter that it expressly contradicted the principle of \u201cself-determination\u201d. It did not seem to matter that it effectively promoted and supported pan-Slavism, which had contributed much more to the outbreak of WW1 than did pan-Germanism.It is fundamentally significant that the new country was specifically named after its largest (Czech) and third-largest (Slovak) minorities, thereby expressly excluding the second-largest minority (German) from its identity. The country\u2019s revered \u201cfounder\u201d Masaryk even referred to this German minority as \u201ccolonists\u201d, despite the fact that they had lived on the land as long as the others. In late 1918, long before the decisions of the (1919) \u201cPeace Conference\u201d were made final, Czech militia occupied the German-speaking areas at gun-point to create \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d. Peaceful protests were suppressed violently, resulting in dead and wounded. The \u201cRevolutionary National Assembly\u201d, consisting primarily of Czechs and a few Slovaks (German and other minorities were not represented) and lacking any democratic legitimacy, then passed a number of drastic laws that bore heavily on the German-speaking and other non-Czech minorities. It also enacted a constitution which was never subjected to referendum. So, despite the prevailing myth of the country having been a \u201cmodel democracy\u201d, it had anything but a democratic foundation \u2013 and in its 20-year existence the government showed less intent to accept and treat its minorities as unqualified equals than did the former Austria-Hungary.Albright wants us to believe the Prague \u201cuprising\u201d of May 5, 1945 was a justified spontaneous act by the citizens. It was, in fact, a completely unnecessary event instigated by communists for the sole purpose of creating a crisis that would ensure that the American army kept its distance so that Prague would be \u201cliberated\u201d by the Soviets. The Wehrmacht was actually bypassing Prague in its retreat to the west and was in the process of evacuating those of its elements still in the city. The uprising forced it to turn to rescue its rearguard and protect German civilians who were being attacked and murdered in the streets. The resulting destruction and deaths on both sides was therefore the fault of the Czechs, and not yet another desperate German transgression.Probably the most suppressed event in Czech history is the 1945-1946 ethnic cleansing of the indigenous German-speakers of Bohemia and Moravia and the Hungarian-speakers of Slovakia. Albright is to be commended for mentioning it at all, although she should be censured for attempting to minimize it by conspicuously using euphemisms like \u201cbanish\u201d, \u201cevict\u201d, \u201cremove\u201d, \u201cexpel\u201d and \u201ctransfer\u201d in place of the rather more honest, but damning, term \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d. In rather disingenuous fashion she claims to have \u201csharply condemned the ethnic cleansing in Central Africa and the Balkans \u2026\u201d while she was in public office, but then implies her support for the 1945-1946 ethnic cleansing because her \u201cparents \u2013 whose values I inherited \u2013 supported the expulsion policy\u201d. She further suggests that the act \u201ccould at least be defended on the basis of extreme circumstances\u201d, that it could be understood as retribution for Nazi atrocities against Czechs during the war. However that doesn\u2019t square with her own reporting that Benes started to \u201csell\u201d the idea of expulsion to the Allies in 1940, long before the effects of the war were felt by the population. In fact, Benes in his post-war autobiography claimed \"It was clear to me immediately after Munich [1938] that when the annulment of Munich ... came in question in the future ... the problem of our Germans would also have to be solved radically and finally.\"Albright also wants to credit Benes for stopping the initial \u201cwild expulsions\u201d. Not true. They were halted as a result of pressure brought to bear by the US and Britain at Potsdam. The \u201cwild expulsions\u201d were orchestrated by the Czech government in exile and sanctioned accordingly. In fact, one of Albright\u2019s heroes Hubert Ripka, complained in July 1945 that the measures used until then had not been severe enough. In his own words: \"We were too slow and too considerate with the Germans. The people failed to carry out the government's plan during the first two months after liberation.\"Enough said."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A well written account of the author's childhood years, first in Prague, then in England during the years during and after WWII, 1937-1948. Besides being a personal memoir, the book delves fairly deeply into the history of the Czech and Slovak regions that actually became the country of Czechoslovakia after the first world war. A very worthwhile read for anyone interested in history who feels a gap in their knowledge in this area. The situation in Czechoslovakia after the end of WWII is more complex and interesting than one who lived through that time in the US might imagine. Because much of this history, especially that during the second world war, is quite tragic, indeed horrifying, one is left with strong feelings of the \"tragic sense of life\" and a diminished complacency that the world can do much better in the future."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent read before we went to Prague.

She deftly weaves information about her parents and family into the historical events in Czechoslovakia prior to and during World War II through 1948. Her parents were intimately involved with the government in exile and she uses her family\u2019s experiences to give a personal touch to a harrowing time, including the post-war period. The book contains personal and historical photographs that point out some of the most poignant times of the war, some of them heartbreaking. A pair of pictures of a cousin show the pre and post concentration camp images of a young girl and brings a personal touch to the horrors of war.
