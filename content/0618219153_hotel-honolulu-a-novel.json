It chronicles a middle-aged mainlander's career as the manager of a lower-status Honolulu hotel and is written in as a series of artificially short, episodic \"just so\" stories. The only characters who were not made intentionally repulsive were pretentious and annoying. Locals were described as stupid and mute so often by characters that it was hard for the reader to draw any other conclusion.  My admiration for this author\u2019s other works compelled me to finish this book. I wanted it to end sooner."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Unreadable due to atrocious pidgin.

The narrator is a disenchanted writer who is the manager of a vintage hotel in Waikiki with topless hula contests and bleary- eyed clientele in the Paradise Lost bar.

The owner of the hotel is a self-indulgent blowhard given to sadistic tricks on his relatives who happens to be a millionaire. The cast of outrageous characters goes on with sad pinch lines at the end of each of their bizarre tales. But, somehow it all seems believable. I couldn\u2019t stop reading about these locals who hate mainlanders who decide to stay on the \u201cgreen island.\u201d Theroux lives in Hawai\u2019i and had a lot of fun with the pidgin that locals speak and some of their attitudes. I was sorry when it ended and I had to get back to less entertaining debacles and ridiculous circumstances.P.S. I am a big fan of Happy Isles of Oceania and Fresh Air Fiend by the same author.I am the author of Wai-nani: A Voice from Old Hawai'i"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I love Paul Theroux's books, puts me to sleep in less than twenty minutes.

The novel's narrator, a down-on-his-luck writer, escapes to Waikiki and soon finds himself the manager of the Hotel Honolulu, a low-rent establishment a few blocks off the beach. Honeymooners, vacationers, wanderers, mythomaniacs, soldiers, and families all check in to the hotel. Like the Canterbury pilgrims, every guest has come in search of something -- sun, love, happiness, objects of unnameable longing -- and everyone has a story. \r\n\r\nBy turns hilarious, ribald, tender, and tragic, HOTEL HONOLULU offers a unique glimpse of the psychological landscape of an American paradise.", "asin": "0618219153", "rank": "375008", "city": "Honolulu", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51q4XNnCIoL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
