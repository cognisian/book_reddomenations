Being from Wisconsin, Sara does an amazing job of painting a wonderful mural of the soul of New Orleans... if that can be done.  She does so not just with the history of a drink, dish, or food item, but also with how people in New Orleans live.  She does so with humor that will disturb any quiet evening with chortles, yet with a profound salute to the people, their heritage, and lifestyle.  Kudos Sara!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Wasn't my fave food-read but fun to read, anyway."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent read for those interested in NOLA food culture  and post Katrina effects"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Paired with Tom Fitzmorris's Hungry Town part of the definitive history of NOLA cuisine andand pre and post Katrina."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I am drinking a Sazerac cocktail as I write this review. Roahen moved to New Orleans with her medschool student husband. With a limited background as a line cook, she becomes food editor for a local paper. In the process she explores the little nooks and crannies of New Orleans cuisine , learning to cook it as she goes. Each chapter focuses on one item, e.g., the Sazerac or poboys, but extends to people and origins. In the process of transforming herself into a native through the culture of food, she drew me back to a city I always have loved. Although the book spans pre- and post-Katrina the hurricane and its damage do not dominate the book or the spirit of the people in it. If you love New Orleans and its food, this book will give you a laundry list of new eateries to try on your next visit."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It made me appreciate New Orleans all the more. Love the food and the stories that go with it!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Forgot to post this here. From a bit I wrote on Rowley's Whiskey Forge in 2008. As true today as it was then:During Tales of the Cocktail this past July, author/distiller Mike McCaw and I mosied up to a table where a lithe young woman was talking to all comers and mixing Sazeracs and brandy old fashioneds for any who cared to sample. Bottles of brandy, whiskey, bitters, and the local anise spirit Herbsaint were at the ready, though running low, as the hordes of reveling attendees wound down Cocktail Hour.Suddenly, she went wide-eyed. \u201cOh my gosh! Did that guy just steal my book?\u201d Sure enough, the russet-and-red hardback she had authored with its cover of a time-worn cocktail sign was now nowhere to be seen, nor was the unsteady admirer who had been thumbing it moments before. That week, with the Hotel Monteleone was awash in premium swag, some thieving cad absconded with Sara Roahen\u2019s personal copy of Gumbo Tales.Just because the thief was in his cups doesn\u2019t mean he was wrong. In fact, he might have made off with one of the choicest take-aways in the hotel. If New Orleans has ever been good to you, then take his lead and beg, borrow, or steal...no, buy a copy of Gumbo Tales without delay.Roahen, a Wisconsin transplant, has proven her food chops\u2014as a line cook, restaurant reviewer for the New Orleans weekly Gambit, board member of the Southern Foodways Alliance, and, tenaciously, in her attempts to trace Wisconsin\u2019s brandy old fashioned cocktails back to the Sazerac through an anonymous Mississippi riverboat captain.She has written a book at turns both gut-wrenching and bust-out-loud funny about finding her place at the New Orleans table (and, apparently, not a few bars). In the process, she wrestles with defining gumbo, boiling live crawfish, the city\u2019s seeming disinterest in vegetables (unless breaded, fried, cooked down, or dressed up with crab, ham, sausage, and cheese), its cult-like following of Hansen\u2019s sno-balls, its robust St Joseph\u2019s Day feasts, po-boy sandwiches, and an influx of newcomers, learning how and why, as she does, to remain in that postdiluvian city.Those of us interested in the drinking and food cultures of New Orleans savor classic cookbooks such as Lafcadio Hearn\u2019s 1885 La Cuisine Creole for shedding light on the origins of creole cooking. Others help explain the growth of both creole and Cajun cookery, such as Paul Prudhomme\u2019s 1984 Chef Paul Prudhomme\u2019s Louisiana Kitchen or John Folse\u2019s recent encyclopedic tomes on South Louisiana cookery (all of which, by the way, contain an abundance of recipes for alcoholic beverages, sips, and nips from absinthe drips to brandy milk punches).Roahen\u2019s book belongs on the same shelf, though it is something else. For one, it has no recipes. Like the city itself now, Gumbo Tales is defined by what some have called the federal floods, but which many just call Katrina. Here, the floods are both a lens for examining, and a touchstone that unites, everyone with connections to the city.Katrina doesn\u2019t mean just the 2005 hurricane itself, but also its evil twin Rita. It means the broken levees, the flooding, the deaths, the harrowing devastation, the political ineptitude, the broken families, and displaced lives that followed the storm and which continue to affect daily life in the city. All of that is enough to make even courageous constitutions turn to drink.Listen to her take:Earlier this week, from my car, I saw a man walk past a water-stained sofa that someone had hauled to the curb weeks ago. He got a few feet beyond it and then doubled back to arrange two of the sofa\u2019s cushions that had gone askew. My throat tensed at this small gesture toward fixing our overwhelming mess.Your throat may tense while reading Gumbo Tales, too. Mine did. It also prodded me to mix a Sazerac, made my mouth water, my stomach growl, and the walls echo with belly laughs as she readily points out her own foibles and outright lies:\"No one but my kindergarten teacher flinched when at six years old I mentioned my desire to become a cocktail waitress when I grew up.\"Or, in an effort to convince a reluctant Vietnamese restaurant owner that she was a seasoned trencherman:\"I eat duck blood all the time.\"Concerning a certain New Orleans fascination with a revered sno-ball queen:\"Most of her followers do not want to date Ashley Hansen. We want to be her.\"Some have said \u201cLet New Orleans sink. It\u2019s their own fault for living there.\u201d The first chapter alone lays open that imbecilic rationale that could only be meant by those who\u2019ve never been or, having been, never left the French Quarter and who know it only as a modern Gomorrah of tacky t-shirts, cirrhotic livers, hustles, and corruption.To think that way is to say that humans are all teeth, toenails, and elbows. Yes, of course, we have those things\u2014and what would we be without them?\u2014But that\u2019s so laughably far from reality nobody could seriously believe it.Intentionally or not, the book is an eloquent argument for why the Crescent City is worth saving. Even after the storms, it remains one of the most vibrant cities in the United States (I\u2019m not unbiased: my own mother recently referred to the place as \u201cyour beloved New Orleans\u201d so take my endorsement with a grain of rice). Read the book, but when you\u2019re done, put it away and high-tail it to New Orleans. Go for the first time, go for the tenth time. Just go.Though she denies Gumbo Tales is a guidebook, a newcomer to the city or an inquisitive visitor who wants to get to know the place more intimately than a casual conventioneer does could do worse than to get a map, a highlighter, and a notebook to mark out, neighborhood by neighborhood, a hit list of po-boys, sno-balls, esoteric cocktails, bakeries, miscellaneous eateries, and watering holes.New Orleans is one of the world\u2019s great culinary destinations because of the people who love it so much. Roahen nailed it when she writes that people love the city as they love a person. And few have captured its residents\u2019 obsessions with eating and drinking more poignantly and lyrically than a transplanted Midwesterner who has embraced the New Orleans table with the zealotry of a convert.Sara Roahen has found her place."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I read this book before taking a long weekend to New Orleans.

Trachtenberg, Wall Street Journal\r\nA cocktail is more than a segue to dinner when it\u2019s a Sazerac, an anise-laced drink of rye whiskey and bitters indigenous to New Orleans. For Wisconsin native Sara Roahen, a Sazerac is also a fine accompaniment to raw oysters, a looking glass into the cocktail culture of her own family\u2015and one more way to gain a foothold in her beloved adopted city. Roahen\u2019s stories of personal discovery introduce readers to New Orleans\u2019 well-known signatures\u2015gumbo, po-boys, red beans and rice\u2015and its lesser-known gems: the pho of its Vietnamese immigrants, the braciolone of its Sicilians, and the ya-ka-mein of its street culture. By eating and cooking her way through a place as unique and unexpected as its infamous turducken, Roahen finds a home. And then Katrina.
