He had been showered with awards by 2000 when City of God was published.  Apparently he was so highly regarded as an author by this time that no editor or publisher dared criticise his work, or tell him that he was writing drivel. However, that is what City of God is---it's drivel.Why is it drivel?  It jumps incoherently from character to character and from decade to decade.  One page you're in NYC and the narrator believes his life is being made into a movie.  On the next page he's in jail for some undescribed crime.  On the next page the narrator is a different character in Lithuania during the Holocaust.  The following page you're in WWI--and on and on and on.  It's as if no editor dared question whether this was madness or genious.Well, it's madness.  Never confuse incomprehensible writing and great literature.  Just because the writer is highly regarded, doesn't mean he can't write a poorly organised and incoherent mess.  That's what this is---a mess."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Nothing"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I have read several other Doctorow books and enjoyed them but this is just a mess. I have no idea what he was thinking or why the sadistic love affair was included since it seemingly related to nothing else. What indeed was the purpose of the \"mystery\" of the cross. Other readers who have rated this a one star have said it better than I have but this is a complete waste of time and insult to readers of an otherwise brilliant author. This ranks as one of the worst books I have ever come across."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "A book whose total is less than the sum of its parts. The log-rolling reviews from other writers and lazy publishers describe a \"dazzling, virtuoso performance\" that is just logorrhea. The main character, whose caustic wit about the Christian Church we are supposed to admire, or perhaps be challenged by, converts to Judaism because he likes a rabbi. He rants on about the Christian church's sins against the Jews. There are scenes from a Jewish ghetto in WWII. All this has been said better before.His final speech, a rambling indictment of the church on the same subject offered as a prayer at his wedding to the hot rabbi, is ridiculous and in real life would clear a room. His great revelation is that he would believe in God if it satisfied his revenge fantasy against Holocaust perpetrators. Very disappointing book."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I found it somewhat difficult to read.  The story seemed to wander all over the place and it was hard to find the theme of the story.

Love the Pem character and the symbolism with the cross at the ending of the story. Love the expansive vocabulary and the lyricality of much of the prose, it almost sings in many places. It was a difficult read because it ran off the rails many times and I can't say in honesty it was an enjoyable one (the camp scenes were overly-long) but I Iiked the novel, if that makes any sense, in the way I \"like\" reading Graham Greene."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I didn't get past page 4."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "A really intelligent and well-educated individual with very good writing skills riffs on a wide variety of topics, with the riffs very loosely tied together with a few key characters.  Nothing that can really be called a plot; a few stories (some of them very good) and a lot of philosophizing.Interesting but at the same time tedious and sometimes almost irritating; at times one is tempted to say either \"who cares\" or \"so what\" or maybe both.Worth keeping for some of the riffs, which are good summaries of an intelligent point of view."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very interesting novel - the city is New York.
