Considering that I'm a native Spanish speaker I thought I should read one of his books. While I was in Mexico last month I went to a bookstore where a clerk recommended me \"Tomorrow in the Battle\" as the most popular book written by Javier Marias. I should admit that the introduction was very intriguing and that the writer did a good job in keeping me interested  about what happened to Maria and Victor after he left her dead at her bedroom. However very often the writer/protagonist gives too much detail and explains many things that are happening in his mind. I felt that he is not leaving too much for the reader to deduct or interpret, too much telling for my taste.  In some of these long sections I frankly had the impression the  writer was paid by word. It's obvious to me that Javier Marias tries to imitate Marcel Proust with his long paragraphs while lacking the beautiful style of the French writer. This was confirmed to me by a mention that Javier Marias makes of \"in Search of Lost Time\" almost at the end. However, I should admit that I found the twist at the end rewarding and made it worth the time I spent reading it. Because of the ending I changed my rating from 3 to 4.  A final comment, the title appealed to me from the beginning because reminded me of one of my favorite poems by Mexican poet Jaime Torres Bodet that starts with this line \"Tenme presente en medio de la lucha\"."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "altho the story basis was intriguing I found the author too digressing for my taste.  I would not but another book by him. I tended to skim the last half.  And probably missed the whole point but could not get past the digression."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Wonderful read just as all other books of this author but sometimes I wish he would be just a tiny bit more focused))). than again, it would then not be Javier Marias."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "While I didn't expect to find this interesting, it is very compelling like most Marias novels. I prefer it to All Souls and even The Infatuation (which starts slow and repetitive but gets good about 50 pages in. Marias always has great insights about life, death, and human nature that make all his books rewarding. I like how characters reappear in different novels creating a Marias world. I think Marias does deserve a Nobel. Definitely read after you read A Heart So White (still his best and one of my top 20 books ever)"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Great detailed account of a passingly weird experience, which the \"hero\" makes more complicated by refusing to let go of it and the people involved.
