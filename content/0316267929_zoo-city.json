Gut-wrenching and compact and so obscenely urban and down to earth you can almost feel the words oozing through your pores and into your bloodstream. Beukes isn't afraid of painting a vivid and visceral picture of a alternative neo South Africa and pushing every conceivable sensory detail through our ear-holes like a sharpened pencil.If it wasn't for the deus ex-machine/ semi non-ending it would have been one of my all time favourites and a very high five stars. As it stands it gets a 4.5 and a standing ovation as one of the better books I've read in a while"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Zoo City is a fantasy sci-fi thriller set in the near future in Johannesburg which uses Shona cosmology and animal familiars to examine a racism that is so ingrained that many don\u2019t even realize that it\u2019s there. Lauren Beukes\u2019 descriptions of both the vibe of the city and its physical reality capture the twin undercurrents of promise and foreboding that are Johannesburg today. The book suffers from a common flaw often found in the fantasy/sci-fi genre: while the setting up of Beukes \u201cworld\u201d and the storytelling and dialogue are spot on, the ending is unsatisfying and not on par with the rest of the book. The ride is much better than the final destination. That said, I read this while visiting Johannesburg and \u201cthe ride\u201d is so well done that I would recommend it to anyone visiting the city."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Enjoyed this very different fantasy. The place is South Africa and everyone who has sinned is attached to an animal which represents, in some way, their past sins. Take a chance on this one."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Zoo City was so weird, but definitely in a good way! Zinzi is a recovering addict and an ex-journalist who now writes scam e-mails when she's not using her magic to find lost items. While she's returning her latest finds, one of her clients winds up dead, she's a suspect, and someone wants to hire for a missing person (one of her no-nos!). Well, Zinzi needs the money after her payment is confiscated as \"evidence\" and soon she's sucked into the glamorous and dangerous music industry as she searches for a missing popstar.What I liked best about Zoo City was the format. It is mainly told from Zinzi's first person account, but there's also some addition documents thrown in. We get an example of one of her e-mail scams which we also get to see her follow up with the in-person portion. There's movie blurbs and reviews which explain more about the Aposymbiots (people who have animals linked to them). There's some magazine articles about the singers and producer that Zinzi is working with. It all came together very well and didn't disrupt the flow of the story at all. I just wish there had been something that fully explained where these animal companions came from and how they get tied to their human.Where Zoo City started to lose me was in the last 100 or so pages. Zinzi had already found Song, so what else is there? Sure the circumstances were quite suspicious, but I'm not sure that I cared anymore. Once Song is back home, there's suddenly more action and danger, and Zinzi just can't catch a break. It was a lot crammed in all of a sudden, and it did get to be a bit confusing in places. The ending is also quite bittersweet. I definitely can't call that a happy ending based on everything that happened. But I suppose things worked out at least for Zinzi?In the end, I liked Zoo City. It held my attention until nearly the end. The setting and world building are quite unique and interesting. I can honestly say that I hadn't read anything quite like this before."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Zoo City is a scab of a community, a crowded slum where some people a bonded with an animal 'familiar' - to use a (pardon the pun) more familiar term - referred to as 'zoos.'  Zinzi lives in Zoo City, along with her Sloth.  Zinzi has a 'gift' of finding lost things.  Though she doesn't like looking for lost people things are a bit tough for her right now and she needs the work.  She's hired by music producer Odi Huron to find a teen pop star - one of the members of a group known as iJusi.At one time in her life, Zinzi was a reporter, until a drug habit landed her in prison.  Now she's weighed down by guilt and her sloth, trying to find her path.  But as she searches for iJusi she encounters something pretty deviant...someone is snatching Zoos and cutting them up to sell their parts to make a little money to buy drugs.  And someone who knows about Zinzi's past is making her out to be criminal.Through the dirty, gritty streets in Zoo City, Zinzi has to evade both the criminals who inhabit the area and the law who would rather leave Zoo City to rot.I've written before, not too long ago, about my appreciation for Beukes' writing.  <em>Zoo City</em> is part horror/dark fantasy and part urban fantasy, and entirely original.  It's been a long time since I've read something that was this unique.  It is also incredibly gritty and dank.  Beukes writes so sharply that I felt I could smell the neighborhoods and the sewage drains and I could feel the fur of Zinzi's sloth.Beukes' writing is so incredibly captivating and the ideas she works with are so original, and her South African locations so unusual (to me at least) that it's easy to overlook the simplicity of the plot.  There's an awful lot that Beukes doesn't tell us - which I actually kind of like ... up to a point.  If answers don't come at all and I'm left with more questions than answers at book's end, then something might be missing.Still, I am at a point where, if I see Lauren Beukes' name on a book, I will want to read it because I know I will be taken somewhere completely new, and I like that a lot.Looking for a good book?  Lauren Beukes' <em>Zoo City</em> is a highly original dark urban fantasy that will leave you breathless and you might not even notice that the plot is a little on the thin side.I received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Wonderful, inventive and beautifully flawed characters. First sci-fi I've read from South Africa. I learned a lot of new words.  Fresh perspective.  I highly recommend this book and this author."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "4.5 stars.  Wow.  That was entirely different!  An exciting, insightful, strange, gritty, and unexpected ride.  Calling this book an urban fantasy and crime noir only scratches the surface.  The story takes place in Joburg, South Africa, in the early 2000s, with one major twist.  A worldwide phenomenon has occurred -- people who do things that make them feel extreme guilt (usually murders, rapes, and the like) are afflicted with Acquired Aposymbiotic Familiarism.  Sufferers with AAF, or colloquially the \"animalled\" or \"Zoos\", find that an animal has appeared (bear, sloth, mongoose, Maltese, scorpion, butterfly . . .  you get the idea) out of thin air as something of a familiar, and with their appearance the animalled develops some form of special ability.  The animalled cannot be separated by too much distance from their animals or else risk paranoia and increasing discomfort, and if their animal dies, the Undertow comes for them -- some sort of dark malevolent force.  The story's protagonist is Zinzi December, whose familiar is a sloth and who has the special ability of being able to find lost things.  Beukes has written an absolutely fantastic book, weaving sharp dialog and social commentary with action.  Since most of the animalled have committed some sort of terrible crime, there is discrimination against the Zoos (different countries have different norms), including housing discrimination.  The idea of two classes is especially interesting as it is set in South Africa.  Beukes reveals enough to make the world fully realized and interesting, but also leaves plenty of gray areas (as in the source of AAP is unknown, many theories abound, and people are divided over whether the special gifts are magic or have some rational basis).  A unique book and highly recommended."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I love this book.  This is a great mix of genres and Beukes is a fantastic storyteller.  Definitely give it a try if you're looking for something different."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I read Lauren Beukes' books from the end to the beginning her list.  This was a bit crazier than her newer novels.  Took me a few pages to get into the lingo, but when I got there, it was a good ride."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I really don't like not finishing books, especially when the author / publisher gives me a free copy, but this has led me to spend way too much time reading books I'm not interested in. And the author / publisher want honest thoughts on these books, so starting with this one, I'm going to try to stop finishing books I don't want to read: So I didn't finish it.In tons of series, you can start with the second, third, or even tenth book and not feel like you missed much, but that isn't true with this one. As far as I can tell, this one isn't even part of a series, but it seems like it is. Right from the beginning, I felt like I was missing some pretty important information. This could be partly because of the dialogue - there are a lot of words that needed to be defined, that weren't defined. I don't even know if they're real words, but they were used way too much to leave readers with no idea what they mean. If the author doesn't want to define them in-text, a glossary would be fine, but it needs something.The next reason I wasn't too interested was because of the setting. The setting is Zoo City, but with how many different racial / ethnic groups the story mentions, it felt like it was jumping around WAAAAAAY too much, even though all of what I read is set in Zoo City or the surrounding area.Zoo City and its culture also need a lot more background. This would help with my feeling like I was missing information, and it could also be a great time to introduce key terms. Zinzi could also use some more background, but that could be provided throughout the book - clarification: she does have a good background, but I think it could be introduced a little earlier, or at least have more details.Think that the book would be too long with the things I'm suggesting the author add? No problem. Some of the random crap in between chapters could be taken out to make room.Seriously, there was movie reviews at one point, and they weren't even complete reviews. Just the beginning, and then the [more] that you would click on to see the rest, except you can't do that because this is a freaking book. Oh, yeah, and this movie wasn't even mentioned in the story at all. So what's the point of the reviews being there?Maybe all of this stuff ends up being important at the end of the book - in case you're wondering, there was also a newspaper article, an interview, testimonies from prisoners, and an abstract from some paper - but I'll never know.I honestly hope you like this book better than I did, if you decide to read it.Note: I received this book for free
