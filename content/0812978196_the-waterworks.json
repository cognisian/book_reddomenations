While trying to unravel the mystery, Pemberton disappears, sending McIlvaine, his employer, the editor of an evening paper, in pursuit of the truth behind his freelancer\u2019s fate. \r\n\r\nLayer by layer, McIlvaine reveals a modern metropolis surging with primordial urges and sins, where the Tweed Ring operates the city for its own profit and a conspicuously self-satisfied nouveau-riche ignores the poverty and squalor that surrounds them. \r\n\r\nIn E. L. Doctorow\u2019s skilled hands, The Waterworks becomes, in the words of The New York Times, \u201ca dark moral tale . . . an eloquently troubling evocation of our past.\u201d\r\n", "asin": "0812978196", "rank": "357259", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51VjhAgXZ6L.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
