Brilliant portrait of British Raj India and the ethnic conflicts between the different political and religious groups and genders. Forster captures the essence of India in his beautiful descriptive passages and the rhythm of the English spoken by Indians, Hindu and Muslim, alike.

M. Forster set against the backdrop of the British Raj and the Indian independence movement in the 1920s. It was selected as one of the 100 great works of 20th century English literature by the Modern Library. The novel is based on Forster's experiences in India, borrowing the title from Walt Whitman's 1870 poem in Leaves of Grass.\r\n\r\nThe novel is set in the fictional city of Chandrapore, which is said to have been based on the city of Bankipur, a suburb of Patna in the state of Bihar in India.\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around four characters: Dr. Aziz, his British friend Mr. Cyril Fielding, Mrs. Moore, and Miss Adela Quested. During a trip to the Marabar Caves (modelled on the Barabar Caves of Bihar), Adela thinks she finds herself alone with Dr. Aziz in one of the caves (when in fact he is in an entirely different cave), and subsequently panics and flees; it is assumed that Dr. Aziz has attempted to assault her.\r\n\r\nAziz's trial, and its run-up and aftermath, bring to a boil the common racial tensions and prejudices between Indians and the British who rule India.\r\n\r\nWikipedia", "asin": "0156711427", "rank": "31713", "city": "Bankipur", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IaTtJ2bfL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
