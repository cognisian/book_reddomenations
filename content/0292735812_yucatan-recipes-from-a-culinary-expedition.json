History, biology, food, geography, photography. I couldn't even begin to absorb it all in one sitting. I love the Yucatan. I've been there numerous times, eaten well, and am very interested in the culture of the Maya. That said, I clearly only scratched the surface in three trips. This book clearly demonstrates the beauty of what can happen when one spends 10 years researching and fine-tuning something that is clearly the core of one's heart. I would love to meet David Sterling one day, and shake his hand for creating a \"cook book\" that is worthy of passing down to my 12-year-old son as a family heirloom.

With a foundation of native Maya dishes made from fresh local ingredients, it shares much of the same pantry of ingredients and many culinary practices with the rest of Mexico. Yet, due to its isolated peninsular location, it was also in a unique position to absorb the foods and flavors of such far-flung regions as Spain and Portugal, France, Holland, Lebanon and the Levant, Cuba and the Caribbean, and Africa. In recent years, gourmet magazines and celebrity chefs have popularized certain Yucatecan dishes and ingredients, such as Sopa de lima and achiote, and global gastronomes have made the pilgrimage to Yucat\u00e1n to tantalize their taste buds with smoky pit barbecues, citrus-based pickles, and fiery chiles. But until now, the full depth and richness of this cuisine has remained little understood beyond Yucat\u00e1n's borders.\r\n\r\nAn internationally recognized authority on Yucatecan cuisine, chef David Sterling takes you on a gastronomic tour of the peninsula in this unique cookbook, Yucat\u00e1n: Recipes from a Culinary Expedition. Presenting the food in the places where it's savored, Sterling begins in jungle towns where Mayas concoct age-old recipes with a few simple ingredients they grow themselves. He travels over a thousand miles along the broad Yucat\u00e1n coast to sample a bounty of seafood; shares \"the people's food\"at bakeries, chicharroner\u00edas, street vendors, home restaurants, and cantinas; and highlights the cooking of the peninsula's three largest cities\u2014Campeche, M\u00e9rida, and Valladolid\u2014as well as a variety of pueblos noted for signature dishes. Throughout the journey, Sterling serves up over 275 authentic, thoroughly tested recipes that will appeal to both novice and professional cooks. He also discusses pantry staples and basic cooking techniques and offers substitutions for local ingredients that may be hard to find elsewhere. Profusely illustrated and spiced with lively stories of the region's people and places, Yucat\u00e1n: Recipes from a Culinary Expedition is the long-awaited definitive work on this distinctive cuisine.", "asin": "0292735812", "rank": "95208", "city": "Cancun", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61DPE4pV%2BzL.jpg", "country": "Mexico", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
