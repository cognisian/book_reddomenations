I didn't think I would be able to read a book on such a sorrowful subject, but I was pulled in and devoured the book. I can say the same about this book - The Unknown Terrorist. I did pick up this novel months ago and was put off by the explicit pole dancer's life, but I came back to it a couple of days ago and started again (from the beginning). I read it in two days. I know if you are attracted to his more fantastic and literary genre style, this book is not that. This is reality for many human beings on this planet (as off-putting as that can be in its grossness), but I truly came to care for the Doll. She became more real for me as this story unfolded and she transitioned from the Doll to Gina. Obviously, this book speaks volumes to the media-driven terrorist mentality with its pigeon-hole judgements set amidst real and imagined concerns. I think this would make a wonderful film and Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu immediately comes to mind as a worthy director."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Brutal but all too believable and could easily happen in today's world and with today's media.

Gina Davies is about to find out when, after a night spent with an attractive stranger, she becomes a prime suspect in the investigation of an attempted terrorist attack. \r\n\r\nIn The Unknown Terrorist , one of the most brilliant writers working in the English language today turns his attention to the most timely of subjects \u2014 what our leaders tell us about the threats against us, and how we cope with living in fear.
