It is interesting that she writes in the first person as a man, yet one does not get the feeling of femineity or overt heroism.  There is good balance although tedious plotting.  It's a very good read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The book is immediately cativating and heart-warming.  Shirley Hazzard and Francis Steegmuller take the reader along with them to love Naples and I never looked back.  I willingly let them force me to love their City just as I imagine they love it."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "It is not difficult to be impressed with Shirley Hazzard's command of the english language. But to weigh down one's writing with unnecessary complication is counter productive, if you seek to gain a wide audience. It might be me but I struggled with this book. It was, as I put it, over written with a surprising number of adjectives used to place the reader in the moment. Francis Steegmuller was as we know, a literary scholar, famous for his study of Flaubert. I can see his influence in this book. You could be forgiven for thinking that the sheer volume of historical information about Haples and particularly its history, was unnescssary to convey a reader's view of the place. I enjoyed Ms Hazzard's \"Greene on Capri\" book for it simple but effective descriptions of places and her's and Greene's time on Capri. Why not that simplicity here in her Naples book?A demonstration of one's vocabulary is not needed to paint the picture. The flowing elegance of Gore Vidal is proof enough of this. Ezra Pound used to tell Hemingway \"to avoid adjectives at all cost\". Not bad advice as his economical, pared down style was effective in letting the reader fill in where needed with imagination. His success was put down to ease of reading as one reason for him to successfully reach the widest possible audience.Academic writing has its place I suppose, maybe in college but not on the pages destined for general readership.Two stars for cleverness. I really did want this to flow, as I looked forward to a study of Naples, a place I wanted described to me in easy to read prose.Bill Hanson."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "In poetic language, this book doesn't shy away from some of the more harsh realities of Napoli, but brings to light its many beauties, too. Hazzard's book reads like a collection of love letters, or the journal entries of a mother to her child--her affection unmistakable and unconditional (though I think she's willing to see this 'child' more clearly and honestly than most mothers assess their offspring).It's easy to become weary and frustrated with Naples at times (I have occasion to visit regularly because of family), but this book provides welcome reminders to look deeper, to appreciate the privilege of slowly coming to know a place of such complexity and long history, so many colors, textures, tastes and, yes, smells; and a people of such vitality, resourcefulness and resilience.This is a wonderful book that offers Napoli the respect and admiration it is due, despite its shortcomings, and will hopefully inspire readers to visit, to stop being afraid of it, to appreciate and perhaps even, one day, to love it as Hazzard clearly does."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The Ancient Shore is a very erudite collection of meditative essays on Naples, that ancient, mysterious Italian city that combines the ancient, the beautiful, the comedic, the diabolical and the grotesque into an admixture both arcane and awesome. Shirley Hazzard is an erudite author and her prose is learned and languid like the city she admires, although at times her writing can seem more somnambulant than sophic.  The book includes a nice collection of black and white photographs."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Having lived in a suburb of Naples for two and a half years I could relate to much of what was written.  The writing is so poetic and delicious that you will want to reread some of it to others just to enjoy it again.  I only wish I had read this book before I moved to Naples so I could have pondered that unique perspective before facing the angels and demons that awaited me."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I love her books- her style, the language, the contents (never dull, yet never heavy)- just perfect! I love her fiction and now, also her essays! Must read if you love Napoli and surroundings...

They have felt the pulse of Naple,  the temperament of the locals and written about it in beautiful prose.Naples is always a mixture of chaos and calm; of shouting and respect; of colors and light.  As they write, \". . . Neapolitans move among their extraordinary architecture as in a natural element:  Even the gradest edifices are not \"monuments\" but expressions of temperament in their nobility, their strangeness or sweetness, their theatricality.\"  Thankfully Naples is still relatively unvisited by hordes of tourists and remains our personal, secret jewel.

It was the beginning of a long love affair with the city. The Ancient Shore collects the best of Hazzard\u2019s writings on Naples, along with a classic New Yorker essay by her late husband, Francis Steegmuller. For the pair, both insatiable readers, the Naples of Pliny, Gibbon, and Auden is constantly alive to them in the present.\r\n\r\nWith Hazzard as our guide, we encounter Henry James, Oscar Wilde, and of course Goethe, but Hazzard\u2019s concern is primarily with the Naples of our own time\u2014often violently unforgiving to innocent tourists, but able to transport the visitor who attends patiently to its rhythms and history. A town shadowed by both the symbol and the reality of Vesuvius can never fail to acknowledge the essential precariousness of life\u2014nor, as the lover of Naples discovers, the human compassion, generosity, and friendship that are necessary to sustain it.\r\n\r\nBeautifully illustrated by photographs from such masters as Henri Cartier-Bresson and Herbert List, The Ancient Shore is a lyrical letter to a lifelong love: honest and clear-eyed, yet still fervently, endlessly enchanted.\r\n\r\n\u201cDeep in the spell of Italy, Hazzard parses the difference between visiting and living and working in a foreign country. She writes with enormous eloquence and passion of the beauty of getting lost in a place.\u201d Los Angeles Times\r\n", "asin": "0226322025", "rank": "191536", "city": "Naples", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JPiPeU8BL.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
