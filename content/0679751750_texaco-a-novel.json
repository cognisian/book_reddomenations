Long after her parents\u2019 deaths, she founded the quarter known as Texaco in 1950, outside the city of Fort-de-France, Martinique. Texaco, owned by Texas Oil Company, had subsidiaries in South America and in the Caribbean. On Martinique, Texaco housed large tankers on land near a mangrove swamp.Prior to Madame Laborieux deciding to build on Texaco\u2019s property, like other poor Martinicians, she inhabited a hutch on the steep slopes, known as the morne, with dirt floors. As a young woman, she lived and worked for families, as a nanny or housekeeper in the city of Fort-de-France.Middle aged, childless, and alone, Madame Laborieux no longer wanted to live on the hills feeling the heat from the fiery sun. She found land near the sea with a gentle slope, temperate winds, and the scent of herbs. This was Texaco; she thought it magical.The watchman was not enchanted with her appearance on Texaco\u2019s grounds, nor was the owner. Madame Laborieux faced numerous expulsions from the property, but continuously returned. More families arrived and dotted the region. Like Madame Laborieux, they erected crude dwellings on stilts, made of tin, crate wood and asbestos, planted vegetables and fruit trees. Eventually the homes, although still crude, were built with bricks and cement.In 1980, the Urban Planner, known as the \u201cChrist,\u201d arrived to Texaco. Without electricity and plumbing, the city judged the property unhealthy and had decided to raze the area.In her own words, Madame Laborieux, provides the Urban Planner her inspiring family history, beginning with her father, Esternome Laborieux, a carpenter by trade, born a slave and freed years prior to Martinique\u2019s abolishment of slavery in 1848. Convincingly, she changed the minds of those in authority, obtaining proper housing and utilities.The author, Martinician, Patrick Chamoiseau, taped the late Madame Laborieux to write this book. Texaco, first written in French, won the 1992 French Prix Goncourt for Texaco.Chamoiseau captured Madame Laborieux\u2019s history replete with her father\u2019s voice; a fascinating man. She revealed the quality of transparency and purity in her father and mother, Idom\u00e9n\u00e9e. And in Madame Laborieux\u2019s own story, you felt the sensitivity, suffering, sadness, passion, loss, lovers, longing, humor, and courage. Madame Laborieux was an indomitable spirit, a woman of profound substance. No doubt, she left an indelible impression on Martinicians.I thought the run-on sentences, although at times poetic and beautifully written were sometimes annoying. This might have been due to Madame Laborieux speaking on tape, in Creole and French. I felt emotionally spent after reading the account of Madame Laborieux\u2019s history. I gave this book four stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "An historical fiction, but the only one I know of which is from the perspective of a Caribbean persona. It speaks from every part of the history of the islands, from a perspective of the sea, to the beach, the streams, the old plantations, the deep valleys, the hidden mountain springs and the tops of ridges. It is not about dates or epcohs. It emphasizes and reflects the islanders in how they think, how they move. Every Caribbean person should read this book and those looking for a more actual look into one of the most historically dynamic regions of the world."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "It was a decent novel but i never would have picked it up if it wasn't for a class."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "i bought this book as part of my mphil research and the way the story is intertwined with the country's history is quite intriguing."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Translating is a difficult thing, and I imagine it's more difficult when you're dealing with Creole and French and language itself is the theme, and no translation is ever finished... but that said... the translators make some really odd choices that make reading this book difficult. They tend to maintain what I assume to be the original Latin phrasing and cognates. I don't speak French, but I'm fluent in Spanish and translate from that language, and in this book I've run across many awkward latin-like phrasings that make me wince. Just two examples:\"It's complicated but here's the real thread: the best bearing was a skin without slavery's color.\" (71)First of all, a more natural way to say this would be \"the real thread is this\" but second and most importantly, what does \"here's the real thread\" mean? That's a metaphor that just doesn't exist in English, as far as I know. And what does \"the best bearing\" mean? I can sort of guess from context, but no one would write a sentence like that in English. Similarly, somewhere I saw a reference to someone's head as a \"pumpkin.\" Maybe that makes sense in French/Creole (it definitely makes sense in Spanish) but in English, if you want to compare someone's head to a vegetable, it's a gourd, or a melon.\"Sunday afternoon became a rite for him.\" (81)I imagine the French here is similar to the Spanish, rito... quick dictionary check says maybe \"rites\"? But you don't really say \"rite\" in English unless you're being very specific/archaic. You say ritual. Like, a Sunday-afternoon ritual. I don't want to be nit-picky, but the text is full of little things like this, and they bug me. It's up to every individual translator to what degree he or she wishes to maintain the tone of the source language, its unique metaphors, images, etc. They may have good reasons for the choices they made. It's an art, not a science. But to my taste, this translation lacks grace, and the text ends up feeling choppy and Latin."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Reading \"Texaco\" is like taking a walk along the ocean. Sometimes the reader walks along a sandy beach and the gentle waves lap against bare toes. However, most of \"Texaco\" is similar to climbing the giant, jagged rocks along the coast while the violent waves crash around you. It's worth the work for once you climb the rocks you find the tidal pools full of treasure.Poetry. Aching, haunting poetry. Completely fascinating"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "this book feels alive in your hands. I found myself feeling almost a deficiency of life compared to the aliveness in the book. not sure i spoke clearly. read the book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is the first book I've read by Chamoiseau, it reminded me of Gabriel Marquez's \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\", and is really fine literature, magical & funny, a caribbean tale of the island of Martinique.  It begins in the time of slavery on the sugar plantations and ends in more modern, corporate times.  The book's ending is surprisingly uplifting and postive.  It was hard to decide what rating to give this book - certainly it deserves the highest praise, however I have a feeling this book is much better read in its' original language.  There are footnotes throughout explaining original Creole terms used.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in Caribbean history or \"universal\" world literature."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "While I have greatly profited from the translator's hard work and I do recommend that anglophones have a copy of her English version handy; reading this book in English is like reading Faulkner or Joyce translated into French.

The shantytown established by Marie-Sophie is menaced from without by hostile landowners and from within by the volatility of its own provisional state.
