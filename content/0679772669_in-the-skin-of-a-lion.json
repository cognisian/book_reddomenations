The writer goes back and forth in time and place.As usual, the writing is poetic, insightful, subtle, complex. The book is full of exquisite description, mixing emotion with motion, action and reaction with detail. He writes the sensual and sensitive,  visual and visceral into every scene. He is a true poet!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Before I this book, I read The English Patient by the same author.  His prose is as beautiful and graceful as poetry or ballet.  However, if you were to ask me specific questions about either of them about what happened to this one and why, did do-and-so get together with the other, why did so-and-so do that crazy thing he did, did he save her from the war,when and why did he do what he did, DID he do that, etc., my answer to you would be, \"I don't have the vaguest idea.\"  I read this book to read more flowing prose, but maybe this time, I'd be practiced enough to speak informatively and correctly these veiled stories.  Well, I am here to tell you to \"GIVE UP\".  If you do figure out all the characters, then I'll send you my 30 and 30 questions about each one, I'll have my friends send them to you.  We'll have a huge party to understand it all.  Perhaps we'll charge for attendees and put out small refreshments.  That TRULY is the best way!!!  Now someone volunteer,!!

The character development of the main character \"Patrick\" is next to non-existent. This book has no sense of pacing either. One moment they're working at a leather tannery, and in the next paragraph they're sucking semen through each others teeth. The main character because clinically insane half way through without any explanation. All in all, this book is just a slew of artsy metaphors and awful characters making the worst possible decisions at the worst possible times mixed with sudden over-the-top erotica.
