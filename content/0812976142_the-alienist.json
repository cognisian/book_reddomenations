I could not put it down and when I did, I awaited the time that I could pick it up once more. It was a pleasant surprise to enjoy it as much as I did considering I dislike reading stories from the first person point of view. However, the story managed to convince me not to put it down immediately. The only reason that I made it 4/5 is that the ending was rather disappointing and anti-climatic. All in all, an excellent read."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "If you\u2019re entertained by the variations of Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple, Hercules Poirot and tv shows like CSI and Criminal Minds then this is right up your alley.  This book takes you back to the early days of the science of criminology and forensic science with original characters that are true to the historical setting.  There is lots of historical background interwoven into the story that makes it more fascinating but also adds so much detail that it gets a little bogged down at times and slows the momentum of the story.  Still there is enough suspense and mystery to keep you turning pages to the very end."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great historian, great story teller, great writing. I am missing the 808 gang already, even a non- thriller reader should picks this novel up."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "While this was required reading for composition at my college, it was a fun book to read. This is not a book for the faint of heart or those who do not tolerate violence against children or sexual deviance, even in the non-fiction realm. It has graphic aspects. Carr gives a wonderful account of late 19th century New York City and thrills with interesting commentary about the city at that time, and develops a solid story with a friendship woven into a tense investigation.

On a cold March night New York Times reporter John Schuyler Moore is summoned to the East River by his friend and former Harvard classmate Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a psychologist, or \"alienist.\" On the unfinished Williamsburg Bridge, they view the horribly mutilated body of an adolescent boy, a prostitute from one of Manhattan's infamous brothels.\r\n\r\nThe newly appointed police commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt, in a highly unorthodox move, enlists the two men in the murder investigation, counting on the reserved Kreizler's intellect and Moore's knowledge of New York's vast criminal underworld. They are joined by Sara Howard, a brave and determined woman who works as a secretary in the police department. Laboring in secret (for alienists, and the emerging discipline of psychology, are viewed by the public with skepticism at best), the unlikely team embarks on what is a revolutionary effort in criminology-- amassing a psychological profile of the man they're looking for based on the details of his crimes. Their dangerous quest takes them into the tortured past and twisted mind of a murderer who has killed before. and will kill again before the hunt is over.\r\n\r\nFast-paced and gripping, infused with a historian's exactitude, The Alienist conjures up the Gilded Age and its untarnished underside: verminous tenements and opulent mansions, corrupt cops and flamboyant gangsters, shining opera houses and seamy gin mills. Here is a New York during an age when questioning society's belief that all killers are born, not made, could have unexpected and mortal consequences.\r\n", "asin": "0812976142", "rank": "12155", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51xJlrRV5%2BL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
