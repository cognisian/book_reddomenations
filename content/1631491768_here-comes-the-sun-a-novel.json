Just when you think it can't get any more depressing, it pulls you down further.  But I thought more about it and that isn't a commentary on how well the book is written.  To be fair, the story was engrossing--I was rooting for (some of ) the characters but every time I did, something awful would happen.  People here have commented that they had a hard time reading the dialect but I listened to the audiobook, which is a great way around that.  I was VERY disappointed in the ending, as the author goes into some detail about what happens to one of the main characters and virtually nothing is said about the others.  Unless she's waiting for the sequel?  Lots of unanswered questions, things not wrapped up.  That said, if you don't mind depressing stories that don't have happy endings, you might like this book."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "no review"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This book was so beautifully written (though hard to read sometimes given the nature of the story).
