The book has many levels, reading it is like peeling an onion, each time revealing more information, about the country, about being an American in the DR with the pros and cons that brings, but also about family life and the traumas and tribulations that brings, along with the damage that family relationships can cause.There  are some shocking moments and revelations and one cannot help but think how different life might have been had the author been brought up on mainland USA surrounded by like peers, rather than on a semi deserted coconut plantation.The Coconut Latitudes also leaves one with questions, why did this happen, what happened to her or him. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone interested in the Dominican Republic."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A must read.

So I was surprised that after reading a few pages of Rita Gardner's memoir about growing up in the Caribbean, I was hooked.  Although she's telling her own coming-of-age story, her work transcends the particular to say something that speaks to all of us as we reach the stage of no longer idealizing our parents. Rita's book also made me realize how truly exposed a writer must feel when they spill their family secrets; I can see why Rita waited until the other members of her nuclear family had passed away before producing the book. That said, I applaud her for being able to talk about her unusual upbringing in such a compelling and lyrical way. She drew me into her story but did not make me feel like a voyeur. It can't be easy to achieve that balance. Bueno!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A book I could not stop reading.  I felt her emotions from start to end.
