The choice to write subject based fragments is interesting and I think would have been more successful if each were as balanced and provoking as the best of them were. Without chronological order to tie the fragments together each segment must carry its own weight. When one fails it feels like a missing piece or a lost opportunity. There's still much to be gained from reading Ru, and the powerful chapters make it worth the time it takes to get to them."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "You have to be willing to go back and forth with her, but she has a very natural style, and she is not glamorizing Vietnamese people.

I was disappointed that it said that none of characters were real, yet reading about Kim Thuy it obviously was based on her own experiences.  The book was beautifully written especially as it was a translation. There were some enchanting vignettes and others almost horrific.  The book is so relevant today when you see the problems faced by those currently fleeing despotic regimes.  I was surprised that when we went to Vietnam no one had told us about the no no of touching someone's head, the cultural issues about food were fascinating. Part of the charm of the book is also in what is not said, she leaves certain matters in the air.  I understand that another of her novels M\u00e3n is even better, I can't wait to read it."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Decades before the current refugee crisis in Europe, the world had faced an almost similar - by means of transportation, at least - human catastrophe: the Vietnamese trying to escape by boat the war ravaged country. Kim Thuy was one of those people, arriving in Canada when 10. Ru - lullaby in Vietnamese, but sounding also like the French word for street and river - is her account of her identity appropriation.Like a slow river, the writing - I've read the English translation, as the book was published in French - flows, with point-counterpoint of topics developed from a vignette to the other. 'I first saw the light of day in Saigon, where firecrackers, fragmented into a thousand shreds, coloured the ground red like the petals of cherry blossoms or like the blood of the 2 million soldiers deployed and scattered through the villages and cities of a Vietnam that had been ripped in two'.It is less than autobiography, and more an account of the 'boat people' destinies and past, aimed to be a 'voice of the Vietnamese people', aiming to compensate the silence of historical references. The life in the new society - Canadian in this case - was hard, but achievable, and many succeeded build a new life. According to her literary testimony, there were less tensions and drama, just a lot of work and desire to integrate. Each one of the slow paced stories is a testimony, tells a little human story revealing more about the Vietnamese society, its human touch and lost memories. Although a literary fiction, it forces the reader to go deep into the anatomy of feelings and to open up to a new world. At the end of the book, the slow sound of the river song still flows in your ears, reminding you to see more than a thing differently. It is both history, especially political history - and psychology in one single little book. You may feel guilty that it took some time to understand this generation of Vietnamese and grateful for such a testimony to bring you the shades of truths.Rating: 4 stars"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Beautifully written.

In Vietnamese it means lullaby; in French it is a small stream, but also signifies a flow - of tears, blood, money. Kim Th\u00fay's Ru is literature at its most crystalline: the flow of a life on the tides of unrest and on to more peaceful waters. In vignettes of exquisite clarity, sharp observation and sly wit, we are carried along on an unforgettable journey from a palatial residence in Saigon to a crowded and muddy Malaysian refugee camp, and onward to a new life in Quebec. There, the young girl feels the embrace of a new community, and revels in the chance to be part of the American Dream. As an adult, the waters become rough again: now a mother of two sons, she must learn to shape her love around the younger boy's autism. \r\n\r\nMoving seamlessly from past to present, from history to memory and back again, Ru is a book that celebrates life in all its wonder: its moments of beauty and sensuality, brutality and sorrow, comfort and comedy.", "asin": "1608198987", "rank": "304494", "city": "Montreal", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Uta0MU6vL.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
