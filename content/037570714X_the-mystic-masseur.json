But his new success causes trouble with his father-in-law, and with a politician via the local press...There are some very humorous moments:flatulent aunt, ''The great Belcher\" - 'she was so overcome she could only belch and ask for water. She got Coca-Cola. It made her burp between belches and she remained uncommunicative for some time.'Or Ganesh's later literary efforts: 'Only two months after the publication of 'What God Told Me' Ganesh scored a stupendous success of scandal. His inspiration was the musical toilet-roll rack.

Naipaul's first novel is a comic look at the Indian community in Trinidad, a theme he pursued in the (better) 'Miguel Street' and perfected in his timeless comic work 'A House For Mr Biswas'. Having read those two works before 'Mystic Masseur' I found this very much a first novel and a prototype for his later comic works. This has all the ingredients of educated fools, the absurdities of religion and politics and martinet wives that hallmark Indian humour-probably all influenced by Naipaul's observations. Worth a read if you haven't read  'Miguel' or 'Biswas' and still so even if you have."}]}, "authors": ["V.S.
