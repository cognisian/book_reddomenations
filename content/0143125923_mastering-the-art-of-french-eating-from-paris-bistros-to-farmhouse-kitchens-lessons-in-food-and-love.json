I  use  dairy products very  very  sparingly and very infrequently,  EVO instead of butter  99% of the time,  very  very very little  red meat only  a tiny bit a few times  a year, no tripe , bacon only 1-2 x annually, no steaks, no  hamburgers, no  frites (  french fries  ever),  lots of  vegetables, salads,  fish,  chicken ,  fruit, lentils and other legumes.  I cook  mostly Middle  Eastern food  which is  healthy and delicious,  that's  what we eat out also ,  we also eat healthy Indian food, particularly at a vegetarian  restaurant near us, and sushi."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I picked up this book hoping, from the title, that it would be a thoughtful examination of the French culture and particularly the French attitude towards food, a kind of guide to the pleasure-loving way of life that they're so envied for, \u00e0 la French Women Don't Get Fat but without the dieting angle. Instead, I was disappointed to discover that this book is no more than a printed-and-bound food blog. Full of personal anecdotes of little to no substance, enthusiastic descriptions of food, and the occasional, infuriatingly shallow foray into the country's rich culinary heritage. All that was missing were the insta-worthy photos of each dish (which even mentions taking!!!). Gag.It felt to me like a book she needed to write just to have something to do while her husband was away for the year. I got the impression that she wanted to be congratulated for existing in a foreign country and speaking basic French. She wrote an entire chapter about a kind of sausage which she refused to ever take more than a single bite of. At the end of it I asked myself, why do I care about this at all..?If you want to read the bland chit-chat between an American and her ex-pat friends in Paris and then hear her describe what a crepe tastes like, be my guest. Personally, I was not inspired and even a little bit annoyed that this book got published.

A lifelong foodie and Francophile, she immediately begins plotting gastronomic adventures \u00e0 deux. Then her husband is called away to Iraq on a year-long post\u2014alone. Suddenly, Ann\u2019s vision of a romantic sojourn in the City of Light is turned upside down.\r\n\r\nSo, not unlike another diplomatic wife, Julia Child, Ann must find a life for herself in a new city.  Journeying through Paris and the surrounding regions of France, Ann combats her loneliness by seeking out the perfect pain au chocolat and learning the way the andouillette sausage is really made. She explores the history and taste of everything from boeuf Bourguignon to soupe au pistou to the crispiest of buckwheat crepes. And somewhere between Paris and the south of France, she uncovers a few of life\u2019s truths.\r\n\r\nLike Sarah Turnbull\u2019s Almost French and Julie Powell\u2019s New York Times bestseller Julie and Julia, Mastering the Art of French Eating is interwoven with the lively characters Ann meets and the traditional recipes she samples.
