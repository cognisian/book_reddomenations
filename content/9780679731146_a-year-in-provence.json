He endures January's frosty mistral as it comes howling down the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, discovers the secrets of goat racing through the middle of town, and delights in the glorious regional cuisine. A Year in Provence transports us into all the earthy pleasures of Proven\u00e7al life and lets us live vicariously at a tempo governed by seasons, not by days.", "asin": "0679731148", "rank": "23189", "city": "Provence", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51CkaBTOPIL.jpg", "country": "FR", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
