I'd include all Colombians in this recommendation as well but I think that while they'd find it interesting, they've long since understood the message. I initially started this book only for the subject matter and really didn't expect to like it, as I usually don't appreciate essays or short stories, they always seem to leave me wanting. But it has been only 6 months since my exodus from Bogota and this brought back so many memories and added an extra Gabo shine to them that I found myself wanting to go back immediately! I only wish I'd had this to read before living in Colombia. The accounts in this book really show the influence of magic realism in the everyday mundane. Sadly, though I'd read all of Gabo's works I suffer from a North American pragmatism that usually means I see things in the context of us versus them. In my \"us\" category we don't see magic, we see reasons, absurdity, and superstition. Magic belongs to \"them.\" Alas, after reading this book, I don't want to be a pragmatic North American anymore, I want to be Colombian!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I enjoyed reading this book as I had visited Colombia, and  reading the essays  brought all the magic  of the country back to me.

Some of the essays here are really top-notch writing, others less so, but all of them contribute in some way, creating a wealth of different perspectives on the country and its celebrated author.
