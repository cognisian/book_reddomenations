I sort of bought it on accident, searching for another book with the similar title Le Flaneur. Ended up choosing this one.

The stroll is more of a symbolic one, as White wanders in and out of the varied histories of the City of Light. White writes about Baudelaire, Colette, the present \u201cheirs\u201d of the French throne and the marginalized minority groups such as the Blacks, Jews, Arabs and even gays.  At first I was disappointed that there wasn\u2019t more physical wandering described; however, I grew to appreciate White\u2019s perspective and insights about topics not usually covered in other books about Paris.\u201c\u2026Paris, land of novelty and distraction, is the great city of the fl\u00e2neur \u2013 that aimless stroller who loses himself in the crowd, who has no destination and goes wherever caprice or curiosity directs his or her steps.\u201d"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "There aren't enough words in the English language to describe how much I love reading Edmund White. I have been reading his books for the last two decades and there isn't a novelist out there who can write so eloquently through the prism of what it is to be gay in America. I just got done reading The Flaneur: A stroll through the paradoxes of Paris. This is a must read for anyone who has been to Paris or wants to go someday like me. His perspective is almost that of a cultural anthropologist who is able to weave together his vast knowledge of history with his own experience revealing key moments in the evolution of Paris as a center for humanitarian causes and the progenitor of a very specific national identity that can only be called French. It is jaw dropping how much he knows about art, classical music, literature, religion and history (ideal for anyone who has a degree in Liberal Arts). I felt like I got to know on a very personal level writers that I don't know much about such as Collette, Baudelaire and Balzac. But what I like most about White's writing is that he is not afraid to reveal his own flaws especially in terms of his lifelong battle with his sexuality and the desire to be recognized as a great writer. Although this is not what drives The Flaneur, for it is a great read of anyone gay or straight, it just leaves an indelible mark on me that I can be who I am, warts and all, and still find meaning and enrichment in the landscape of human living. And that no matter how degraded, burdened by social status or marginalized one can be, the ability to create intelligibility out of ones suffering and to communicate that to others can never be taken away or disregarded."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I love this French word and was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, it has little to do with aimlessly strolling around Paris and more to do with the author's political/social rhetoric.

Edmund White, who lived in Paris for sixteen years, wanders through the streets and avenues and along the quays, into parts of Paris virtually unknown to visitors and indeed to many Parisians. \r\n\r\nIn the hands of the learned White, a walk through Paris is both a tour of its lush, sometimes prurient history and an evocation of the city's spirit. Edmund White's The Fl\u00e2neur is opinionated, personal, subjective.\r\n\r\n As he conducts us through the bookshops and boutiques, past the monuments and palaces, filling us in on the gossip and background of each site, he allows us to see through the blank walls and past the proud edifices and to glimpse the inner human drama.\r\n", "asin": "1582342121", "rank": "917461", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51J7w6ivvJL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
