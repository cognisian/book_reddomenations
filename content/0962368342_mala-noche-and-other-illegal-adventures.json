It is a vividly homoerotic account of Curtis's passionate and mostly unrequited love for several Mexican street youths who come to Oregon seeking jobs and money. \r\n\r\nMala Noche, also one of Van Sant\u2019s first films, captures well 1970s Portland, before Skid Row residents were evicted and the area was turned into \u201cThe Pearl\u201d and homeless shelters and cheap hotels became stores selling expensive junk. \r\n\r\nThe powerful imagery is reminiscent of Jean Genet and of other Beat Generation writers. There is great sadness in the lives of these lost young men but also great beauty and dignity, which Curtis effectively captures. \r\n\r\nIllustrated with the author's photos and drawings and accompanied by several essays and poems, this book deserves a place in both Hispanic and gay literature collections", "asin": "0962368342", "rank": "1737475", "city": "Portland", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/7143S9DGTYL.gif", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
