The book is so well-written, the flow of the narrative is wonderful and the stories are just so engrossing.  Absolutely, a wonderful exposition of the end of World War and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the beginning of the modern Turkish Republic.  Having seen the movie The Water Diviner (amongst some others), the period is really wonderfully evoked by this author.Highly recommended."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "great read"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Well written and researched"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A delightful and reliable survey of early 20th Century Istanbul!

For the first time ever, they had agreed to use a nationally unified calendar and clock. Yet in Istanbul\u2015an ancient crossroads and Turkey's largest city\u2015people were looking toward an uncertain future. \r\n\r\nNever purely Turkish, Istanbul was home to generations of Greeks, Armenians, and Jews, as well as Muslims. It welcomed White Russian nobles ousted by the Russian Revolution, Bolshevik assassins on the trail of the exiled Leon Trotsky, German professors, British diplomats, and American entrepreneurs\u2015a multicultural panoply of performers and poets, do-gooders and ne\u2019er-do-wells. During the Second World War, thousands of Jews fleeing occupied Europe found passage through Istanbul, some with the help of the future Pope John XXIII. At the Pera Palace, Istanbul's most luxurious hotel, so many spies mingled in the lobby that the manager posted a sign asking them to relinquish their seats to paying guests.\r\n\r\nIn beguiling prose and rich character portraits, Charles King brings to life a remarkable era when a storied city stumbled into the modern world and reshaped the meaning of cosmopolitanism.\r\n\r\n32 photographs", "asin": "0393351866", "rank": "442030", "city": "Istanbul", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fv5M0A7-L.jpg", "country": "Turkey", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
