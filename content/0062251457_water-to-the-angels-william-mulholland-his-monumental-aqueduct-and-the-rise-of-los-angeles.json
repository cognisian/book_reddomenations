Self-taught genius (something not allowed, almost not politically correct these days - no diploma in..... whatever?  Horrors!), resourceful and clever, he persisted against all odds by being so persuasive that most who worked with (or against) him thought they were getting the last word.  Terrific read, educational without being preachy."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This story, featured in the movie Chinatown, has always fascinated me. It could have happened no where else but California and particularly in Los Angeles. No wonder it was made into a film.

Not more then 5 minutes in and  the term son of a B was used twice. How can I feel safe letting them proceed to listen if this is the into?
