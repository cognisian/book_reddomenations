It was a gift for our nephew who is a car designer and although he has never been to New York we thought he would admire the author's talent.  He was both awed and inspired by it.  It got such a rave review that we also purchased several more and sent them to friends who live in New York.  This book is very unique and well done.  Made us want to head to New York to use as a guide book to admire the artist's buildings."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "cute little book and interesting thing about nyc!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Felt to much like a child story book."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Just sketches - was looking for old photos & desciptions"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "To those reviewers who also wanted information about the buildings as well - this is not that book. It is explained how the book came about, pure and simple. This book is a very personal view of New York architecture through an illustrator's eyes. A visitor, he lived in New York for a few years, gradually drawing the buildings which caught his eye. The buildings seem alive, they have personality and style - a visual feast. This is a special book for those who know and love New York. Apparently, the author has even had commissions to do individual New Yorkers' own dwellings."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Was a gift to a New Yorker and he really liked it.
