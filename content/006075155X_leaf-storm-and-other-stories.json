It is 2:30 pm on Wednesday, 12 September 1928. It is the funeral of the foreign doctor \u2013 \u2018the most hated man in town.\u2019 Only Colonel Aureliano Buendia, his 30-year-old daughter Isabel, and \u2018the child\u2019 who is almost 11 years old, attend the funeral; the rest of the town would rather let the old doctor rot. Isabel wonders how they will treat her now.The 60-years-old doctor arrived in Macondo 25 years earlier, in 1903, and lived for the first eight years with the Colonel. Through the three narrators (three generations of the Buendia family) we learn of Isabel\u2019s husband who abandonned her nine years ago, never to return, when \u2018the child\u2019, the boy, was two-years-old. We learn of the Colonel\u2019s wife, Adelaida, and \u2018Pup\u2019 the priest. And we learn why the townfolk despise the foreign doctor so much.Leaf Storm is about abandonment, loss, betrayal, rejection, solitude, reclusion and isolation, and the rituals of death. The writing of Gabriel Garcia Marquez is succinct, evocative, and sensory. This novella is the precursor to One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967, published in English in 1970) set in the same fictional town, with some of the same characters. Although I am reading this novella many years after reading the novel, it nevertheless excels as a stand-alone short story by the Colombian winner of the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature. And it makes me want to read One Hundred Years again."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Good book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Brilliant author and great set of short stories. The short stories make fun campfire tales."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "... which was actually the initial prelude. I've read a number of the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, most notably, his classic\u00a0One Hundred Years of Solitude (Harper Perennial Modern Classics)\u00a0as well as\u00a0Love in the Time of Cholera (Oprah's Book Club). I first read \"Leaf Storm\" a few decades ago, and decided it needed a re-read. Like William Faulkner, who found a seemingly inexhaustible source of material in that small postage-stamp size of earth that is Lafayette Co., Mississippi, which he fictionalized as Yoknapatapa Co., so too Marquez produced story after story based on his own town of Aracataca, Columbia, which he would fictionalize as Macondo. Both Faulkner and Marquez would win the Nobel Prize, separated by a bit more than four decades.\"Leaf Storm\" was published twelve years before \"One Hundred Years...\" It is a novella which sets the stage for his later work. All the familiar elements are there: the town itself, of Macondo. Always in the background is the Civil War, which tore Columbia apart, dating from the 19th Century. The Civil War provides so much of the impetus for current actions. And there is the \"magical realism\" that is the hallmark of Marquez' style... those seemingly impossible events that just happen.Marquez draws the reader in with the death of a doctor that the town hated. The search for the \"why\" carries the reader through the first half of the novella. As Marquez describes the town's feelings, in a style reminiscent of Faulkner : \"...satisfied rather at seeing the longed-for hour come, wanting the situation to on and on until the twirling smell of the dead man would satisfy even the most hidden resentments.\" In fact, the authorities deliberately delay burying him... so that the town can smell the odor of his dead flesh. Now, that is hatred, in a classic sense.  So, what did the doctor do to merit this? It is actually what he did NOT do: he refused to treat wounded soldiers during the Civil War.  Hum. Proving that there are many disparate threads that seem to tie together, I had to reflect upon the various administrators of VA hospitals who denied medical care to veterans. As the priest in Marquez' story posits it: their burial should be conducted by the sanitation department.In this early novella of Marquez, his narrative powers are quite apparent. He tells the story from three different points of view, which span three generations. There is Colonel Aureliano Buendia, who, as a point of honor, originally decided to shelter the doctor, and is determined to see that he has a proper burial, despite the town's feelings. The other two narrators are Buendia's daughter, Chabela, and her child. And always, there is how Marquez describes Macondo, and its founding: \"Arriving there, mingled with the human leaf storm, dragged along by its impetuous force, came the dregs of warehouses, hospitals, amusement parlors, electric plants; the dregs made up of single women and men who tied their mules to hitching posts by the hotel, carrying their single piece of baggage, a wooden trunk or a bundle of clothing, and in a few months each had his own house, two mistresses, and the military title that was due him for having arrived late for the war.\"The publisher of my copy, issued in 1979, was Picador. They tacked on six short stories, of varying quality, as it always seems, to fill out their offering.  \"The Last Voyage of the Ghost Ship\" is five pages long, but only one sentence.  Take a deep breath.  It is a stylistic precursor to\u00a0The Autumn of the Patriarch.  And I found the story \"Blacaman the Good, Vendor of Miracles\" a riff, between Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Thomas Pynchon.I was going to originally rate it 4-stars, since I found the ending somewhat unsatisfactory, but upon further reflection, decided it was simply an excellent prelude for \"100 years...\", thus, 5-stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Cut to the Chase:The stories that work in this novel are powerful and enthralling\u2026 the first line, spoken by a young boy, is \u201cI\u2019ve seen a corpse for the first time.\u201d  Each of the stories in this collection is dense, seeming to reach beyond the dramas of each character\u2019s individual events and tragedies, but it is the title story which most diligently holds and mesmerizes us. Though the other stories in the collection are well-written and constructed, I have to admit that they didn\u2019t pull me in the same way \u2013 many are fable-like: a man with wings, a vicious miracle-seller swindler whose child assistant becomes a true miracle-worker, an unidentified drowned man who seems to have such fantastical proportions that he eventually changes the way the villages think as well as how they construct and design their houses. The pacing also slows down after the title story, and while the passages are often quite poetic and beautiful, there is often very little action to push the story forward. The stories are still entertaining, just less involving, depending more on lyrical language than compelling or realistic characters.Greater Detail:\u201cLeaf Storm\u201d is short and covers only 30 minutes in the lives of three protagonists, a young boy, his mother, and his grandfather, as they each separately prepare for the funeral of the dead doctor. Through our changing narrators we learn about the history of the town \u2013 how the leaf storm brought a banana company which transformed Macondo, at least temporarily, into a thriving, prosperous town.  We learn how the doctor, unnamed throughout the piece, first arrived to the colonel\u2019s family and set up his practice, only to be forgotten when the banana company\u2019s physicians replaced him.  We\u2019re told that the doctor locked himself into his room, receiving no patients and seeing no visitors for years afterwards \u2013 not even Meme, who worked as a servant within the colonel\u2019s household and eventually became the doctor\u2019s mistress.  The stories unfold slowly and mysteriously \u2013 we start at the end, when the doctor is dead, when the town has already collapsed, become abandoned, and we are taken slowly through the past, so that each of the little mysteries are answered: what happened to the young boy\u2019s father, why the doctor is hated, as well as why the colonel seems determined to secure a respectable burial for the doctor.Other selected synopses:\u201cA Very Old Man with Enormous Wings\u201d \u2013 an old man who speaks an unintelligible language (which a priest quickly concludes is not Latin) and has enormous (though tattered) wings is found hurt and kept in the chicken coop, where an enterprising couple decide to sell admission\u201cThe Handsomest Drowned Man in the World\u201d \u2013 a fable-like tale about how the discovery of a very large, very handsome drowned man captures the hearts and imaginations of a small fishing village.\u201cBlacaman the Good, Vendor of Miracles\u201d \u2014 a fable-like tale about a charlatan who sells miracles and restorative ointments and buys a local boy to be his apprentice/accomplice.\u201cMonologue of Isabel Watching It Rain in Macondo\u201d \u2013 the only one that is linked back to the title story, has Isabel, the middle generation representative from our title story, recalling a large rain storm while her husband was still living with them, she was pregnant, and the doctor (though unmentioned) was still alive.\u201cNabo\u201d \u2013 another fable-like tale about a man who is kicked in the head by a horse and afterwards lives in total seclusion and isolation, so that the only reason people know he is still alive is because the food they prepare for him is taken and eaten, three times a day, for years.Comparisons to Other Authors:I\u2019ve mostly just read Marquez\u2019s older works, and this is a much quicker introduction to a master writer. Though it veers from fantastical to real throughout the collection, and I think that not all of the stories are as tightly wound as the first, it\u2019s a good set of stories. In terms of other short story collections that tie together as a connected series of short stories, I can\u2019t think of examples that are older, but it seems increasingly common in newer works (Melissa Bank\u2019s The Wonder Spot, the last few stories in Lahiri\u2019s Unaccustomed Earth \u2014 though I would probably pick this collection over either of those)."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I especially loved the \"A Very Old Man with the Enormous Wings.\" It smacked of surrealism and was simply and beautifully written. Very melancholic in tone and narrative, as expected of Gabriel Garcia Marquez."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "What can I say?There is a reason that Gabriel Garcia Marquez is a master. He didn't just have a unique and powerful way of writing, he also had a unique and powerful way of seeing the world around him. I am also reading Gabriel Garcia Marquez, A Life by Gerald Martin. It has been a fascinating journey, reading Leaf Story as I read about the early years of his life in Colombia and traveling in Europe, what used to be the U.S.S.R., the United States, and Cuba.It was easy to give this book 5 stars. A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings may still be my favorite story, but the entire book got under my skin.\u2028The brilliance is this: The leaf storm is the arrival of--for lack of a better term--industry to the small town of Macondo. The leaf trash are the elements of the population that the storm blows into town, leaving the residents already there feeling like outsiders.This is presented in the prologue. What follows is so unique. It is not factual, it is like watercolor bleeding on a wet canvas. The stories sprawl into the psyches of the imagined citizens.
