(It also helped when I found the glossary of Aboriginal words sprinkled throughout at the back.) So much to admire in this and it feels like being invited in on a special journey. It's so challenging to write a novel that engages actively with complex and important political issues - such as Native Title, care of the land, cultural differences, the continuing legacy and impact of the invasion, what non-indigenous people can receive, learn and contribute, etc etc. Melissa Lucashenko handles it all with amazing skill and heart and a light deft touch. Recommended."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Really enjoyed the writing for most of the novel, the last few chapters tended to be too drawn out."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Single mother, Jo Breen, doesn\u2019t have an easy life, especially not after purchasing a farm through her divorce settlement. The farm\u2019s rundown, her moody thirteen-year-old daughter is less than cooperative, and maintaining the grounds at a local cemetery doesn\u2019t pay the bills. But Jo\u2019s proud of her land, her Aboriginal heritage, and she plans to make something of it and her life. The appearance of a good-looking man named TwoBoy Johnson, who\u2019s battling for Native Title rights, adds both excitement and frustration for Jo. Meanwhile, unsettling signs and strange voices from the land itself make Jo question her connection to the past and her future as the stakes for all of them might be higher than she thought.There\u2019s a lot to like about this award-winning novel. The characters\u2019 voices are strong, their beliefs, choices, and conflicts are well portrayed.  The descriptions of the land are so detailed defined that I felt as if I was there. Thankfully, a glossary of terms at the back of the book helped with the jargon, although not all of the words were there, so I had to guess at some.I didn\u2019t like the way the story lagged in places, though. There\u2019d be moments of tension or conflict or even tragedy, then things would calm down for many pages of not much happening. Jo\u2019s lifestyle is such that she spends a lot of time alone, which makes much of the book an inner monologue narrative. This isn\u2019t a bad thing, but rather too much of a good thing. Although I learned a lot from this book, I didn\u2019t find it as engaging as I\u2019d hoped it would be."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Interesting and original characters, absorbing plot, significant issues and written in fresh, gutsy language that reflects a refreshingly different and important world view."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The main character rang true.

I had read a few reviews of this book and wondered what to expect. At first I found it very convoluted and confusing, after finishing it I wondered why it took me so long to get into the rhythm of the book. I had to reread the first few chapters a couple of time and then it rolled along nicely for me. The language and lingo I just had to set aside and to accept what I thought the meanings were and that helped. I got to enjoy the Characters more and more as the book developed. By the time I had closed the book for the last time I was truly engaged and that surprised me as it had taken so long to get into it and initally I found the Characters abrasive. At the end of the book I loved them all, well mostly all.
