However, I lost interest in all the characters because they seem embodiments of a theme, or thesis, or a cliche (and the starving newspaperman in Paris who is aware that he is a cliche or the lively countess with her many lovers is not more thrilling because of that awareness, or because their self-conception is the opposite of the public persona they project).  I didn't care what happened to anyone in the book and also lost believe that any persons experienced the setting and era of the book in the way the characters did."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Social commentary of fascinating times, Paris in the 20's, Berlin later and the horrible forming of Hitler's era.exciting, shocking, sometimes romantic"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Not historical enough, easy read, would have loved if Violette Morris was given greater depth. It is sad the writer agreeably made her a monster rather than develop on more of how she actually was as a person in a positive light. There is always good behind the evil, of which I would have liked to hear more about. It only shed the depressing side of Violette.(Lou)"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Fantastic book.

It is a place of intoxicating ambition, passion, art, and discontent, where louche jazz venues like the Chameleon Club draw expats, artists, libertines, and parvenus looking to indulge their true selves. It is at the Chameleon where the striking Lou Villars, an extraordinary athlete and scandalous cross-dressing lesbian, finds refuge among the club\u2019s loyal denizens, including the rising Hungarian photographer Gabor Tsenyi, the socialite and art patron Baroness Lily de Rossignol; and the caustic American writer Lionel Maine.\r\n\r\nAs the years pass, their fortunes\u2014and the world itself\u2014evolve. Lou falls desperately in love and finds success as a race car driver. Gabor builds his reputation with startlingly vivid and imaginative photographs, including a haunting portrait of Lou and her lover, which will resonate through all their lives. As the exuberant twenties give way to darker times, Lou experiences another metamorphosis\u2014sparked by tumultuous events\u2014that will warp her earnest desire for love and approval into something far more.", "asin": "0061713805", "rank": "584253", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Vr-T4%2Bn%2BL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
