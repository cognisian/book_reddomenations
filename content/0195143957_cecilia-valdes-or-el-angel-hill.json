Just wished iti would have been the long original version"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Cuban literature is known for the poetry and not for novels. Cecilia Valdez, nonetheless, is excellent, written by an expatriate in America who was active in the struggle for independence from the scummy Spaniards. It is a blistering denunciation of slavery in Cuba via the vehicle of a novel, akin to Uncle Tom's Cabin, only much harsher. It also offers a window of the times (aside from the issue of slavery).Having several memorable characters, the story is interwoven with contemporary details and minor historical events and descriptions of architectural, economic, political and agricultural facts. An importer of African slaves, also owning a sugar cane plantation has a wastrel son who is interested in a beautiful mulato girl, unbeknownst to him that she is his half-sister. Their father has seen to her financial means without her knowing who he is, and what is his relation to her, and is intent on keeping them apart in order to avoid an incestuous relationship.I read the story in Spanish so I cannot judge how good are the translations."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A classic of Spanish-American literature, although not so well-known.  Set in nineteenth-century Cuba, it reveals in a lively way the nature, both charming and horrific, of the slave and white and black and mulatto society emerging toward revolution."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Set in colonial Havana, Cecilia Vald\u00e9s by Cirilo Villaverde opens a window to the evils of slavery and colonialism in early 19th century Cuba. Written in 1839, Villaverde was describing contemporary evils much as Harriet Beecher Stowe did. Think of it as the Cuban Uncle Tom's Cabin, even if it goes light on violence and heavy on flowery romance.Our eponymous heroine is a strikingly beautiful quadroon orphan who -- unbeknownst to her -- is the product of an adulterous union between C\u00e1ndido de Gamboa, a lustful and wealthy landowner and slaveholder, and a mulata slave, who dies in childbirth. Eager to avoid a scandal, Don C\u00e1ndido ships his illegitimate mixed-race daughter Cecilia to an orphanage. Her grandmother, Chepilla, after five years, is able to regain custody of the girl through threats of exposure, and brings Cecilia up, but Chepilla doesn't disclose Cecilia's paternity. The coquettish and beautiful Cecilia has many admirers, but she gains a dangerous one: Don C\u00e1ndido's legitimate eldest son and heir, Leonardo.Leonardo Gamboa is engaged to the well-born and white Isabel Ilincheta from Alqu\u00edzar, a good match arranged by Leonardo's mother with a girl Leonardo has known since boyhood. However, like his father, Leonardo has a roving eye. Leonardo unwittingly falls in love with Cecilia, his half-sister, and she with him. But the fickle Leonardo abandons Cecilia for Isabel Ilincheta and respectability. Needless to say, this tale of star-crossed lovers will end tragically.In addition to critcisms of slavery, the novel also shines a light on the racial and class system of colonial America. The Spanish-born oligarchs top the social hierarchy, followed by the white Cuban colonists (criollos), sorted by wealth and family distinction. Class distinctions also exist among those who are mixed race and those who are black, between those who are free and those who are still enslaved, those who toil on the sugar plantations and those in domestic service at the homes of the elite, between those who were born on Cuban soil and those who were plucked from Africa.The novel needs to be read in light of its 19th century origins. Like the Spanish literature of its day on which this Cuban classic was modeled, Cecilia Vald\u00e9s is a great deal more flowery than Latin American or Spanish literature today -- or even than the novel's British or American contemporaries. Like 19th century novels, Cecilia Vald\u00e9s reads as a melodrama. However, the story is still an interesting one, and Cecilia Vald\u00e9s is still considered the greatest Cuban novel of the 19th century.This abridged Audible.com edition is an excellent introduction to 19th century Spanish literature (Cuba was still a Spanish colony then) for upper-level Spanish students and especially for hispanohablantes like me trying to get a firmer foundation in the great literature of heritage. The multi-cast recording makes the action easy to follow, and at just a little over two hours, this abridged version won't get too overwhelming. This isn't just for those trying to improve their Spanish."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I don't like reviews that tell me the story--so let me simply say that this is a great read.

Originally published in New York City in 1882, Cirilo Villaverde's novel has fascinated readers inside and outside Cuba since the late 19th century. \r\n\r\nIn this new English translation, a vast landscape emerges of the moral, political, and sexual depravity caused by slavery and colonialism. Set in the Havana of the 1830s, the novel introduces us to Cecilia, a beautiful light-skinned mulatta, who is being pursued by the son of a Spanish slave trader, named Leonardo. Unbeknownst to the two, they are the children of the same father. Eventually Cecilia gives in to Leonardo's advances; she becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl. When Leonardo, who gets bored with Cecilia after a while, agrees to marry a white upper class woman, Cecilia vows revenge. A mulatto friend and suitor of hers kills Leonardo, and Cecilia is thrown into prison as an accessory to the crime.\r\n\r\nFor the contemporary reader Helen Lane's masterful translation of Cecilia Vald\u00e9s opens a new window into the intricate problems of race relations in Cuba and the Caribbean. There are the elite social circles of European and New World Whites, the rich culture of the free people of color, the class to which Cecilia herself belonged, and then the slaves, divided among themselves between those who were born in Africa and those who were born in the New World, and those who worked on the sugar plantation and those who worked in the households of the rich people in Havana. \r\n\r\nCecilia Vald\u00e9s thus presents a vast portrait of sexual, social, and racial oppression, and the lived experience of Spanish colonialism in Cuba.", "asin": "0195143957", "rank": "563629", "city": "Havana", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510zENDV3JL.jpg", "country": "Cuba", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
