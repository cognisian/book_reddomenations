The writing is out-of-the-box superb: one astounding sentence after another, each of which subverts its own assertion.

Highly recommend."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Ben Lerner\u2019s 10:04 recalls the postmodernism of Amis, DeLillo, and transposes its solipsism onto the 19th century aesthetic of a Sebald. At times beautiful, and often funny, Lerner\u2019s experimentations nevertheless fail to amount to a sustained engagement with the problems he treats. Casting a version of himself\u2014at times in the first person, at times in the third\u2014Lerner takes us through the story of his confrontations with a potentially fatal illness, questions of artificial insemination, and the structure of time. One wonders if he realizes the preciousness of his Brooklyn aesthetic; we encounter detailed treatments of the conceptual art world, his co-op, etc. Perhaps stripping down this paraphernalia would reveal the clarity of his voice in future work."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "As I mentioned in another review, a couple of novels I\u2019ve read recently have had authors using techniques I don\u2019t typically like but, somehow, managed to do so successfully.  (The Nix by Nathan Hill is the other example.)In this case, Mr. Lerner has written a post-modern, self-referential novel that blurs the line between memoir and fiction. In 10:04, we have as protagonist a writer writing a book about a writer writing a book about the same experiences that are described in this book.  Usually, I despise these kinds of stories.Mr. Lerner, however, manages to overcome my dislike.  He does so by a plot that bounces around in clever, short scenes and by a prose style that revels in amazing intelligence while still engaging the reader\u2014a fine line that is too often difficult to manage.  He also succeeds because, frankly, this book is short.  I\u2019m not sure I could have tolerated this for an extended period.  But, as it is, it is an excellent read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book is amazing! I just finished it recently, and I'm dying to re-read it already because I know that there must be hundreds of nuances and clever little bits that I missed completely on the first read-through.

Some of the writing is just brilliant, and that makes up for the rather wandering plot.  The ideas in this book are very original.
