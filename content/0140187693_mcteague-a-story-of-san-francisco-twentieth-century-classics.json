McTeague is a dentist who learns his trade by working with a disreputable practitioner. He is withdrawn, routine-bound and isolated, and brutishly strong. He falls in love with Trina, who is referred to him by one of his few friends, Marcus. Marcus is attracted to Trina, but steps aside so McTeague can woo her. Things change when Trina wins $5,000 in a lottery she entered before her marriage. Marcus is angry at letting her go; McTeague feels Marcus has no rights. Both feel entitled to control money that Trina won as a single person. Once she has money, Trina becomes a miser, lying about money she uses and refusing to turn loose of funds under any circumstances. A secondary story mirrors this; the maid Maria tells anyone who will listen that her family once owned a marvelous set of solid gold dishes and utensils. The local junkman, Zerkow,  marries her, and drives himself to madness trying to find the gold. Both marriages degenerate into truly awful spousal abuse. In both cases, the focus on money leads to greed violence and a desire for vengeance that takes over every relationship. Trina and McTeague cannot weather reversals of fortune; they separate, and McTeague goes on a headlong, ill-fated quest for more money.The only people who escape to a constructive relationship are an older couple that are afraid to court until late in the novel, after the man has sold a patent for binding articles. They are able to finally find love and a supportive partnership. 'McTeague' is a dark but well written novel.  My problem is that Norris constantly refers to McTeague as 'stupid.' If I had a dollar for every time he did, I could buy gold dishes. How stupid could McTeague be if he is a dentist, even a dicey one? Isolated, crude, hidebound and flawed, yes, but the constant use of 'stupid' shows a contempt for the character that he doesn't earn until later in the story.  Modern readers should be aware that the book is open about anti-Semitism toward Zerkow, which reflects how people felt at the time. Also, Trina's family is German, and these characters use an exaggerated German accent every time they speak, which is unnecessary and slows down the pace of the nove."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Don't buy this book if you want to avoid eye strain.

This edition by Amazing Stories, however, is very difficult to read due to its layout.

Few works have captured the seamy side of American urban life with such graphic intensity.\r\n\r\nFrank Norris\u2019s 1899 novel explores the impact of jealousy and greed on an otherwise typical relationship. McTeague has been adapted twice for film, including the 1924 film Greed, directed by acclaimed auteur Erich von Stroheim.\r\n\r\nThe novelist Frank Norris is almost forgotten today, but in books like \"McTeague,\" published in 1899, he paved the way for a whole generation of American writers--a generation that included Theodore Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis and, less directly, Hemingway and Fitzgerald. McTeague is a dentist saddled with a grasping wife, and the book chronicles his rise and fall in awkward but powerful prose. \r\n\r\nThis type of social realism, so contrary to the uplifting entertainment of the day (and to Mark Twain's more fanciful, comic novels), provided turn-of-the-century America a disturbing mirror in which to view itself.", "asin": "0140187693", "rank": "293603", "city": "San Francisco", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51FsMGRth1L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
