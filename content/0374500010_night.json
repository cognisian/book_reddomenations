This new translation by Marion Wiesel, Elie's wife and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language and spirit truest to the author's original intent. And in a substantive new preface, Elie reflects on the enduring importance of Night and his lifelong, passionate dedication to ensuring that the world never forgets man's capacity for inhumanity to man.\r\n\r\nNight offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.\r\n\r\n\u201cA slim volume of terrifying power.\u201d The New York Times", "asin": "0374500010", "rank": "480", "city": "Auschwitz", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41kkT0WKkXL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
