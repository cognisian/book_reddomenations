The Barletta family is somehow cursed.  The father, Cosimo,  is evil to the ends of his fingertips.  The revelations at the end stagger the imagination, though one guesses who the guilty party or parties are.  All the characters are well-drawn, especially Giovanna.  I thought Montalbano was going to give in to his lust for the girl, but he luckily restrains himself.  Bravo, Salvo!  We meet all our old friends, Mimi', Fazio, Catarella and the doctor.  We are glad to do so.  I have the DVD of this one, which was released before the book was translated into English.  I must see it again and find out if it accurately follows the story line of the book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I love all of his books.
