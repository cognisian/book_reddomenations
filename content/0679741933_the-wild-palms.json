Having read Faulkner's best-known masterpieces a few years ago, I had had my eye on _The Wild Palms_ (1939) for a while. The novel certainly has a good reputation (unlike, say, _Requiem for a Nun_), but it seems to me it is often eclipsed by the novels that Faulkner published before it. I for my part regard _The Wild Palms_ as an example of Faulkner at his best. So, if you've enjoyed _The Sound and the Fury_, _As I Lay Dying_, _Absalom, Absalom!_, _Light in August_, and _Go Down, Moses_, you will love _The Wild Palms_. I'd even say if you haven't read the other novels, if you're new to Faulkner and are thinking of starting with _The Wild Palms_, by all means, do so.Known also as _If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem_ (the author's original title), _The Wild Palms_ consists of two equally compelling interwoven stories: \"Wild Palms\" and \"Old Man.\" In a sense, _The Wild Palms_ could be regarded as Faulkner's greatest structural experiment, as the two stories are not directly related: there is no unity of time, place, or character. The two stories, however, are tightly related thematically. The obvious link is that both are concerned with men dealing with women. To me, the most important theme the two stories share is that of individual freedom, and what people choose to do with it.In \"Wild Palms,\" two lovers go on a mad adventure as they try to escape respectability. \"Old Man\" follows a convict on the loose during a flood and his efforts to take a pregnant woman to safety. As I said, freedom is an important issue here, and I couldn't stop turning the pages of _The Wild Palms_ as I wondered whether the main characters would \"do the right thing\" in the end and find the redemption that so many Faulkner characters seek, though only some find.Why two stories? Faulkner wrote each one separately. He started with \"Wild Palms,\" which was to be a short story but developed into a novel. \"Old Man\" was written later and interwoven with the first story \"as a counterpoint to [\"Wild Palms\"], in an effort to maintain the intensity of the latter story without allowing it to become shrill\" (from the editor's note). Given the genesis of the text, many have contested whether _The Wild Palms_ is really a novel, but then the same question has been asked of _Go Down, Moses_, which is composed of short stories. The great Spanish novelist Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela once defined the novel as \"a book featuring the phrase 'a novel' under its title\" (I'm paraphrasing). Is _The Wild Palms_ a novel? \"Sure,\" I would say, \"it's a Faulkner novel.\" Looking at the issue from another perspective, those who answer the question negatively are still getting an awesome deal: two novels for the price of one.The ten years between 1929 and 1939 saw the publication of Faulkner's best work. (If we have to choose a low point in this decade, that would probably be _Pylon_, though this is still a good novel.) _The Wild Palms_ brings Faulkner's decade of creative virtuosity to a magnificent close. The novel, incidentally, was greatly influential in France (it provided the structure for Agnes Varda's film _La Pointe Courte_, which some take to mark the true beginning of the French New Wave) and in Latin America (the translation to Spanish was by Borges).Next on my Faulkner reading list: _The Hamlet_ (1940).Thanks for reading, and enjoy the book!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This was a book by Faulkner, so good anyway, but I'm pretty sure I lost the train of thought along the story (ok I have read it all in a bookshop without buying it while I was waiting a friend - it was a long wait).
