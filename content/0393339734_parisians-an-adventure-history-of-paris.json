Each chapter is a different story.  Be ready to be surprised by some of the stories.  Most were interesting but a couple challenged my interest.  Most chapters written like a historical novel adding conversations that would obviously not be known but I personally didn't mind that.  It made the stories more interesting and real.  Worth a read if you are very interested in the history of Paris."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great writer.
