But this book I found very hard to enjoy.  Each chapter is a short story that seems to end before you understand what happened to the character.  The story flow in some of the chapters was confusing.  There are also numerous \"F-word\" occurrences and it also helps if you can interpret Ebonics in some chapters."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Maxine Beneba Clarke demonstrates remarkable range in Foreign Soil. The stories shift between Australia and less developed countries, as Clarke explores triumphs and tragedies that connect lives in cultures that are quite different from each other.\u201cDavid\u201d tells the story of two Sudanese women in Australia. One fled from her village with two sons and memories of a third. The younger woman faces the older woman\u2019s disapproval because she wears her hair short, dresses in jeans, has abandoned religion, and rides a bicycle. Yet it is ultimately the bicycle rather than Sudanese tradition that binds the two women in this touching, sad story. It\u2019s easily my favorite in the collection.\u201cHarlem Jones\u201d is a young man whose parents moved to London from Trinidad. He establishes his individual identity by joining a group protest against the police killing of a black man. The story is honest in its refusal to paint a more uplifting picture of forsaken lives.\u201cHope\u201d is about a girl from the mountains who goes to Kingston to find her place in the world and instead learns hard lessons about love. It\u2019s a sweet \u201cslice of life\u201d story that should please fans of romance (as opposed to fans of romance fiction).\u201cForeign Soil\u201d tells the story of Angela, who falls in love with Mukasa and leaves Australia behind when he takes her to Uganda. In his own world, however, Mukasa seems like a different person. The story is bleak and troublingly unfinished.\u201cShu Yi\u201d is the name of the new kid in school. The story\u2019s narrator, a brown-skinned girl named Ava, is relieved that someone has replaced her as the target of bullies in their white suburban Australian neighborhood. When Ava\u2019s mother forces her to be Shu Yi\u2019s friend, the outcome is surprising. This is my third-favorite story in the collection.\u201cRailton Road\u201d is the Brixton headquarters of young black rebels who are assembling to express their growing discontent. The story highlights characters who take different approaches to black empowerment while sniping at each other and treating women as slaves.\u201cGaps in the Hickory\u201d is a story of poverty, prejudice, and pride. Poverty should transcend race as a unifying force, but some characters in the Mississippi setting of this story are blinded by bigotry as they rage against people of different races and sexual identities. The themes are particularly relevant today, as bigots cling to an imagined past that never existed. This story, like some others in the collection, is masterful in its use of dialect. Its combination of an ugly present and a hopeful future make it my second-favorite story in the volume.\u201cBig Islan\u201d is about the restlessness of life in Jamaica. The story is again notable for its use of dialect.\u201cThe Stilt Fishermen of Kathaluwa\u201d tells the story of Ansanka, a boy soldier who fled from Sri Lanka and is now being detained in Australia. The story alternates between Ansanka\u2019s harrowing young life and the unsatisfying life of the lawyer who interviews him in a detention facility. I love the story\u2019s contrast between people who think they have problems and people who really have problems.A girl who gets stuck hanging upside down symbolizes life\u2019s deeper problems in \u201cThe Sukiyaki Book Club.\u201d The writer enters the story to explain that she doesn\u2019t know how to rescue the girl. Parental fear -- the writer\u2019s need to assure that her own kids are safe and well adjusted (or at least safe) -- is the story\u2019s focus. I\u2019m not fond of stories in which writers intrude into the narrative, so this was my least favorite.In \u201cAviation,\u201d a woman whose husband was killed on 9/11 is asked to become an emergency caregiver for a Middle Eastern child no family will take. The story is a brief but powerful look at misdirected prejudice.None of the stories in Foreign Soil are bad, most are quite good, and a handful are excellent. I appreciate the attention to important themes that are overlooked by modern authors who so often devote themselves to the trivial. If I could, I would give Foreign Soil 4 1/2 stars, rounded up to 5 because this is an impressive group of stories."}]}, "authors": ["Maxine Beneba Clarke"], "isbn": "1501136364", "longitude": 151.2164539, "periods": ["2000s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "Foreign Soil: And Other Stories", "word_cloud": "love globe author tell great tale interest show talent indeed exist everywhere highly recommend base recommendation find excellent find hard enjoy chapter short story seem end understand happen character story flow chapter confuse also numerous occurrence also help ebonics chapter demonstrate remarkable range shift le developed country explore triumph tragedy connect live culture quite different tell story sudanese woman flee village son memory third younger woman face older woman disapproval wear hair short dress jean abandon religion ride bicycle yet ultimately bicycle rather sudanese tradition bind woman touch sad story easily favorite young man parent move establish individual identity join group protest police kill black man story honest refusal paint uplifting picture forsake girl mountain go place world instead learn hard lesson love sweet slice life story please fan romance oppose fan romance fiction tell story fall leave take world however seem different person story bleak troublingly name new kid school story narrator girl name relieve someone replace target bully white suburban australian neighborhood mother force friend outcome surprising story headquarters young black rebel assemble express grow discontent story highlight character take different approach black empowerment snip treat woman story poverty prejudice pride transcend race unify force character set story blind bigotry rage people different race sexual identities theme particularly relevant today bigot cling imagine past never exist story others collection masterful use dialect combination ugly present hopeful future make story restlessness life story notable use tell story boy soldier flee detain story alternate harrowing young life unsatisfying life lawyer interview detention facility love story contrast people think problem people really girl get stuck hang upside symbolize life deeper problem writer enters story explain know rescue girl fear writer need assure kid safe well adjust least safe story focus fond writer intrude narrative least woman husband kill ask become emergency caregiver child family story brief powerful look misdirect bad quite good handful excellent appreciate attention important theme overlook modern author often devote trivial star round impressive group", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature"], "summary": "From a new voice in international fiction, a prize-winning collection of stories that cross the world\u2014Africa, London, the West Indies, Australia\u2014and express the global experience \u201cwith exquisite sensitivity\u201d (Dave Eggers).\r\n\r\nIn this collection of award-winning stories, Maxine Beneba Clarke gives voice to the disenfranchised, the lost, and the mistreated.
