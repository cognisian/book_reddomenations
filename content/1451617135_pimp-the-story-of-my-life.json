This is alternately described as fiction and non-fiction. After reading it, I can see why. I'm sure it is the author's real story of his life, and a view into his world. On the other hand, as a pimp, he has a pension for exaggeration. In some passages, you start to question if what he's saying is really possible. I think that's the reason the book contains the little disclaimer about it being a work of fiction. Nonetheless, it is a fascinating glimpse into the psychology of pimps and prostitutes and surprisingly informative. The slang is from the 20's and 30's and kind of hard to understand sometimes, but the book includes a handy glossary. Pimp is both a page turner, and a significant work. I'd highly recommend it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I liked this book because the story actually pulls you in.

The book that brought black literature to the streets is back to show the Hip Hop generation what it\u2019s all about, where they came from. By telling the story of one man\u2019s struggles and triumphs in an underground world, this book shows the game doesn\u2019t change - it just has a different swagger. Iceberg Slim's story is now depicted in a major motion picture distributed worldwide. Iceberg Slim: Portrait of a Pimp shows Slim's transformation from pimp to the author of 7 classic books.\r\n\r\nAs real as you can get without jumping in, this is the story of Slim\u2019s life as he saw, felt, tasted, and smelled it. Only he could tell this story and make the reader feel it. If you thought Hustle & Flow was the true pimp story, this book is where it all began. This is the heyday of the pimp, the hard-won pride and glory, small though it may be; the beginnings of pimp before it was dragged in front of the camera, before pimp juice and pimp style. A trip through hell by one man who lived to tell the tale. The dangers of jail, addiction and death that are still all too familiar for today\u2019s black community. \r\n\r\nThough it is a tale of his times, it will remain current and true for as long as there is a race bias, as long as there is a street life, as long as there is exploitation.\r\n\r\n''Pimp is an eye-boggling netherworld documentary, a (--) tale of ferocious emotion, expressed through action.''
