Morgan's portraits are all of those who were in some way related to Skid Road of Seattle, the path down which the logging industry drug its logs, creating many a \"skid\" and the unofficial dividing line between the wealthier of the city (or at least the respectable) and that part of town where the rest of the U.S. got the nickname Skid \"Row\". Here you'll find portraits of pioneers, yellow journalists, importers of women, vaudeville promoters, whorehouse investors, rabble rousers, and labor organizers all trying to make it in Seattle. A great read whether or not you know any other of the city's or the Pacific N.W.'s history, but it is limited to glimpses (albeit very entertaining glimpses) rather than a thorough historical survey of the city."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Thanks!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "We live in such a COLORFUL city!!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "if you want to know about the Northwest this is the book to read.
