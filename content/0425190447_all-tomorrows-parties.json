I really liked the way Gibson blended the old characters with some new ones in this saga of the life and death of a post-earthquake SF Golden Gate bridge-based temporary autonomous zone (Google that term if you don't know what a TAZ is) and the people who live in it. Scifi, cybe-rmysticism, corporatism, antique watches, and the use and abuse of the internet are all  featured in this entertaining wrap up."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This product logistics is very fast, I am very satisfied with it, the price is cheap, quality is very good for anyone.

Made no real point. I'm a huge Gibson fan but I think this one of the inflection points in his career where he seems to have fired his editor and gone off the deep end as far as rambling messes. Read it to finish out the series but don't expect much, his newer work like The Peripheral is even worse."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Classic Gibson, love it.

His body shakes with fever dreams, but his mind roams free as always, and he knows something is about to happen. Not in Tokyo; he will not see this thing himself. Something is about to happen in San Francisco\u2026\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe mists of San Francisco make it easy to hide, if hiding is what you want, and even at the best of times reality there seems to shift. A gray man moves elegantly through the mists, leaving bodies in his wake, so that a tide of absences alerts Laney to his presence. A boy named Silencio does not speak, but flies through webs of cyber-information in search of the one object that has seized his imagination. And Rei Toi, the Japanese Idoru, continues her study of all things human. She herself is not human, not quite, but she\u2019s working on it. And in the mists of San Francisco, at this rare moment in history, who is to say what is or is not impossible\u2026", "asin": "0425190447", "rank": "550966", "city": "San Francisco", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/412638N0RFL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
