Overall, just way waaaay WAAAAAAAAAAY too much background filler to support a story that never really delivers the goods. The detailed exploration of the characters would have been great if the story had been up to snuff. The setting is definitely intriguing, but the book just ends up feeling like a 12-hour long director's cut of The Royal Tenenbaums. I think authors (and screenwriters) are often confused into thinking that the children of the uber-wealthy are always interesting subjects. Many tales of idealistic offspring clashing with their rich, materialistic parents have been told. This one is just an extremely over-detailed one, that slogs alongside a pretty pedestrian (and often forgotten) plotline. By the time the book gets back on track and attempts to wrap-up said plot, I had pretty much ran out of gas in my attempt at caring. A good editor could have chopped this down into something that would have been at the very least okay, but this gigantic, bland tale of wealthy New Yorkers is a total snooze and an excruciating read that never seems to end."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Great read about New York in 1970's.
