It's not a standard history book, more vignettes of various topics related to the city.  It's perfect book for bedside reading.  Not a page turner that you can't put down, more like a leisurely stroll with an interesting friend with a conversation that ranges all around London.  The writing is very good, and I find myself repeatedly amazed at how the author was able to organize and present such a plethora of relatively unrelated information in such a cogent manner."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Lots of information on the founding/formation of London, but sometimes very dry and hard to follow on the Kindle.

Vividly anecdotal and brilliantly original.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important study of the city ever written, London confirms Ackroyd\u2019s status as what one critic called, \u201cour age\u2019s greatest London imagination.\u201d Much of Peter Ackroyd\u2019s work has been concerned with the life and past of London, but this new book is his definitive account of the city. For Ackroyd\u2019s London is a living organism, with its own laws of growth and change, so London is The Biography , as the book is subtitled, not a History. Here Ackroyd portrays London from the time of the Druids to the beginning of the twenty-first century, noting magnificence in each age. But this is not a simple chronological record.\r\n\r\nHe writes chapters on the history of silence, the history of light, the history of childhood, the history of Cockney speech, and the history of drink. He constructs a comprehensive, multilayered image of the place, animated by his concern for the close relationship between the present and the past, and the peculiar \u2018echoic\u2019 quality of London which actively affects the lives and personalities of its citizens.", "asin": "0385497717", "rank": "65442", "city": "London", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51QqSLJK15L.jpg", "country": "England", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
