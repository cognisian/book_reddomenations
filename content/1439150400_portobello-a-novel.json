This one was consistently out at the library and I finally got to read it. I have to say it wasn't my favorite of her books, though it is still quite good. Similar premise of several interwoven narratives of morally and otherwise challenged characters in London tangentially connected by crimes. There is a quality to Rendell's characters, they tend to be wretched, in fact I think of them as rendellian wretcheds, there is just a way she wrote about psychology of things that oppress a person be it poverty, lack of drive or obsessions. In this case it is primarily the latter. The main character becomes spectacularly obsessed with a specific kind of sweets and nearly allows it to screw up his life. In fact it is this character that I had a problem with the most. He's well to do, has a comfortable life, intelligent and yet makes really bizarre choices. I'm not just talking about his obsession. The behavior I'm referring to is his strange careless for personal safety. Inviting random strangers in on chance the money he found belongs to them, leaving his house burglar ready. Rendell does a terrific job of describing the psychology of obsession and in all fairness she never did care all that much for likability of her characters, but this time the ratio was dramatically off for me and not enough occurred otherwise to offset it. Still absolutely worth a read, such strong writing, the Portobello area described so vividly, it becomes a character itself, the one constant player, despite the changes, observing patiently the clumsy humanity scurrying past it, scheming and plotting and trying to get by. Well observed. Well written. Recommended."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Firstly, did Ruth Rendell actually write this?

The text was extremely repetitive."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Stephen King is quoted that Rendell creates stories of \"obsession, instability, and malignant coincidence.\"  To that I would add psychological creepiness and downright weirdness.  I found the book distasteful, from the three unemployed, on-the-dole losers to the gallery owner's unrelenting addiction.  Almost every page had a description of his desire for Chocorange.  Also annoying was the doctor who by almost any standard overstepped her objective role to \"friend\" the schizophrenic.  Arson, burglary, murder, family ostracism - the book has it all.There was not one character to relate to and the vaunted description of Portobello was as junky as its nearby characters' lives."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of her best!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Another mixture of Ruth's dysfunctional people.
