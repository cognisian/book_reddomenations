This book is such a mish-mash of events and, often poorly and inaccurately, disguised personalities that it should not be rated as 'fiction' but rather a poorly written compilation of facts.  I personally have known and have counted among my close friends many of the characters in this book.  Except for some obvious descriptions and badly disguised names, these people are nothing akin to those in this book.  Factual errors abound in names, events, characters and locations - which wouldn't be too bad if the book were truly a work of fiction.  However, putting a bunch of misrepresentations based on fact into a book doesn't qualify as either 'fact\" or \"fiction\".  And as for learning about the lovely people of Jamaica ...  how can anything important be learned from such a hodge podge of informatioN?"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I spent a fair amount of time doing business in Kingston Jamaica in the late 1980s, travelling there about a dozen times in five year period, and my work led me to various places on the island. Even though it was written by an outsider, I have read very few books that really captured the feeling of the place and the people in the way that \"The Book of Jamaica\" did. I wonder how much of the central character, the American writer, was based on Banks himself?I loved the atmosphere and plotline of the book, and Banks conveys much of Jamaican culture with great insight and skill.  However it was hard for me not to despise the main character, a neurotic American writer who neglects his family to hang out with his fascinating, \"exotic\" Jamaican friends.  An American trying to beat Jamaicans at rum drinking and dominoes is pure foolishness!  But it rings true as something a typical American visitor would try to do. Eventually as the central character becomes more involved with the real Jamaica and the lives of his new friends, he gets a lot more than he bargains for.  A book well worth reading."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I judged a book by it's cover and bought this book mostly because of the title.  I am an American and have always had an unexplainable fascination with Jamaica.  I have been to Jamaica twice but don't claim to know much about the history of the culture.  When I saw what the story was about and the date on the book I was interested, so I began to read...The beginning of the book started off extremely slow (for me) with the story of the murder and the many different characters involved became confusing at times.  I was surprised during the second part of the book to get sucked in to the story of the narrator, the Maroons and Nyamkopong.  The characters were very beleivable to me and I ended up loving the book!Being that it is not written by a Jamaican from a Jamaican point of view it may not be a \"guide to jamaica\" but for me it captures the feeling of the culture from an American's point of view.Long story short- It was not what I expected but I enjoyed it and recommend it."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "It was interesting to me to read reviews of this book written by Jamaicans or people who have more first-hand knowledge of Jamaica than a beach vacation can provide. This is because, for me, the cultural and political aspects of Jamaican life that were depicted in _The Book of Jamaica_ far outweighed in interest anything about the protagonist/narrator. I found it odd how unable I was to hold the plot involving the expatriot professor in my mind while I was reading. It created an unpleasant effect because his story would occasionally interrupt the story of the Maroon communities and I would remember that there was more than one thing the story was about. The proportions, in this sense, felt wrong to me.This said, I found the communties and lifestyles described here to be fascinating reading and Banks (at least apparently) wrote with loving respect about the Jamaican culture and people. A nice change from the usual cliche descriptions."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Forget all the Guides to Jamaica. If you really want to know how an American might feel living in my country, where \"no problem\" is the national password, yet a country full of problems, read this little known--at least in Jamaica--book. It captures the undertow of violence as well as the beauty of the place, giving a most realitic and compelling description, albeit in fictional form. You will want to read this book before taking a short or long visit. Though Russell Bank's experience won't be yours, that is, unless you choose to stay."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The plot of this early Bank's novel revolves around a vacation to the  seductive island of Jamaica by a college professor and his wife. They rent  a home with patio and swimming pool on the outskirts of Port Antonio.  Servants come on each day to cook and clean. The couple is protected from  the turbulence of the island's cultural and political life by a fence made  of both wire and social class (not to mention race). But the professor, the  narrator of this tale, soon finds himself enjoying the company of the  locals; in particular a young Rastafarian who has plenty of powerful  Jamaican ganja he is very willing to share. Sure enough, before too much  time has elapsed, the professor is smoking all the day long and providing  transportation in his rental car to a small group of Marroons and Rastas  that stay locally for short periods of time but live up in the mountains  where they have their marijuana fields and live in villages with their  families.There are several trips back to the island after the narrator's  life is completely transformed by his experiences during the first. His  wife no longer accompanies him however as their marraige was one of the  first casualities of his abrupt new fascination with Rastfarianism, Marroon  culture, and ganja. You can imagine! But what starts out as an adventure  full of promise, unfortunately follows an inevitable course ending in  sorrow and not a little horror. Any attempt to blithely transcend  differences of race and class are doomed, the author seems to be saying.  And ganja will not of its own power make a story turn out all right,  regardless of it's enormous capacity to create an internal state that seems  to be mystically protected from all outward harm. In fact the opposite may  be true. Ganja may release traits and fuel decisions that create a trend  which rushes towards confrontation with dis-associated, unwanted  self-aspects and a pressing need to re-assess one's relationship with the  basics of self-preservation and the will to continue living.This is a  compelling, well-written novel that has the advantage of having marijuana  as one of its central characters. The role marijuana plays in the story and  in fueling the psychological development of the protaganist is handled  skillfully and raises interesting questions about what effect heavy use may  have on the trajectory of one's life. As a Jamaican travelogue, the book  will spellbind as it is really a tour de force of gritty observational  writing. Banks obviously harbours a deep love for Jamaica and a well-earned  respect for the raw power of Jah Rastafari as expereinced through the  taking of his sacremental offering; the holy herb ganja."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Mr. Banks wastes the opportunity of a lifetime by  trying to tell a confused, inaccurate, story set in Jamaica. He is not the first, and probably will not  be the last American to come to Jamaica looking for  simple answers, and finding none goes ahead anyway with results that are  laughable in some instances and insulting at others. I am an American,  married to a Jamaican who has lived in Kingston and that owns a house in  the Port Antonio area and so am very familiar with topics Mr. Banks touches  on in his novel. One could get a better insight into Jamaica by reading the  original James Bond novels set in Jamaica by Ian Fleming (Dr. No, The Man  with the Golden Gun etc.) than to try to get any insight from this  regrettable effort."}]}, "authors": ["Russell Banks"], "isbn": "0060977078", "longitude": 0.0, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "Book of Jamaica", "word_cloud": "love anyway several time pleasure interesting sporadic account adventure investigation glorious history culture include crime scandal rock island only buy favorite list whole easy recommend want really better event often poorly inaccurately disguised personality rat rather poorly write compilation fact personally know count close friend many character obvious description badly disguise name people nothing akin error abound name event character location bad truly work fiction however put bunch misrepresentation base fact fiction learn lovely people anything important learn hodge lodge information spend fair amount time business late travel dozen time year period work lead various place island even write outsider really capture feeling place people way wonder much central character writer base love atmosphere plot line conveys much jamaican culture great insight skill however hard despise main character neurotic american writer neglect family hang fascinating exotic friends american try beat rum drink domino pure foolishness ring true something typical american visitor eventually central character become involved real live new friend get lot bargain well read judge cover buy mostly title american always explainable fascination twice claim know much history culture saw story date interest begin beginning start extremely slow story murder many different character involve become confuse time surprise second part sucked story narrator character believable end love write jamaican point view capture feel culture american point story expect enjoy recommend interesting review write people knowledge beach vacation cultural political aspect jamaican life depict far outweigh interest anything find unable hold plot involve ex patriot professor mind read create unpleasant effect story occasionally story community thing story proportion sense felt wrong say find community lifestyle describe fascinate read least apparently write love respect jamaican culture people nice change usual cliche description really want know american living country problem national password yet country full problem little know least capture undertow violence well beauty place give realistic compelling description fictional form want take short long visit experience stay plot early revolve vacation seductive island college professor wife rent home patio swim pool outskirt come day clean couple protect turbulence island cultural political life fence make social class mention race professor narrator tale soon find enjoy company local particular young rastafarian plenty powerful jamaican ganja willing share enough much time elapse professor smoking day long provide transportation rental car small group locally short period time live mountain marijuana field live village several trip back island narrator life completely transform experience first wife longer accompanies however marriage first causality abrupt new fascination culture ganja imagine start adventure full promise unfortunately follow inevitable course end sorrow little horror attempt blithely transcend difference race class doom author seem say ganja power make story turn right regardless enormous capacity create internal state seem mystically protect harm fact opposite true trait fuel decision create trend rush towards confrontation unwanted press relationship basic continue compel advantage central character role marijuana play story fuel psychological development protagonist handle skillfully raise interesting question effect heavy use life travelogue spellbind really gritty observational write obviously harbor deep love respect raw power experience take sacramental offering holy herb ganja bank waste opportunity lifetime try tell confuse inaccurate story set first probably last american come look simple answer find none go ahead anyway result laughable instance insult others american married live own house area familiar topic touch better insight reading original novel set insight regrettable effort", "genres": ["Essay", "History", "Travel Writing", "Politics"], "summary": "Banks explores the complexities of political life in the Caribbean.\r\n", "asin": "0060977078", "rank": "1353315", "city": "Jamaica", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51L0UV2OnXL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
