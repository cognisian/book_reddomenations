These classic stories are well written and fun to read. Victorian England is a fascinating setting as the reader is transported back to this more formal and reticent time. The mystery is always entertaining and the action and suspense will still resonate with readers today. Read and enjoy."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I thoroughly enjoyed reading the entire collection of Sherlock Holmes.
