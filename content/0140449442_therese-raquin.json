That French guy you don\u2019t have to read. Stendahl, check. Balzac, check. Flaubert, check. Zola? Do not pass GO, do not collect $200, proceed without stopping straight to the 20th century. Right? Wrong. No better place to start than this novel labelled as \u201cputrid literature\u201d by the critics. Zola, only 27 when the novel was published, responded to the uproar in his 1868 Preface to the Second Edition:\u201cIt is quite evident that my work belongs to my critics, and that they may consider it repulsive without giving me any cause for protest. What I do mind, however, is that not one of the prudish journalists who blushed as they read THERESE RAQUIN seems to me to have understood this novel. If they had understood it, perhaps they would have blushed even more, but I should now be enjoying the private satisfaction of seeing that they were disgusted for the right reason.\u201cI set out to study temperaments, not character. That sums up the whole book. I chose protagonists who were supremely dominated by their nerves and their blood, deprived of free will, and drawn into every action of their lives by the predetermined lot of their flesh. Therese and Laurent are human animals, nothing more. In these animals, I have tried to follow step by step the silent operation of desires, the urgings of instinct and the cerebral disorders consequent on a nervous crisis. The love between my two heroes is the satisfaction of a need; the murder that they commit is the outcome of their adultery, an outcome they accept as wolves accept the slaughtering of a sheep; and finally, what I have been compelled to call their \u2018remorse,\u2019 consists in a simple organic disruption, a revolt of the nervous system when it has been stretched to breaking-point. I freely admit that the soul is entirely absent, which is as I wanted it.\u201dPutrid literature? Count me in. Slumming, perhaps, but a slum in which the actions of the protagonists are portrayed with a cold eye for telling details as well as acute psychological analysis of desire, passion, revulsion, hatred. This in a novel that moves with cinematic swiftness, finishing off in under 200 pages. Pity that dull, dreary Dreiser learned so much from Zola without ever learning the very French art and practice of concision. High points include chapters XI Murder, XIII Morgue, XVII Insomnia, XX Wedding, XXI Ghost, XXVI Stroke, XXX Cat, XXXI Vice, and XXXII Oblivion.

The numbing tedium of her life is suddenly shattered when she embarks on a turbulent affair with her husband\u2019s earthy friend Laurent, but their animal passion for each other soon compels the lovers to commit a crime that will haunt them forever. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin caused a scandal when it appeared in 1867 and brought its twenty-seven-year-old author a notoriety that followed him throughout his life. Zola\u2019s novel is not only an uninhibited portrayal of adultery, madness, and ghostly revenge, but also a devastating exploration of the darkest aspects of human existence.\r\n\r\nRobin Buss's translation superbly conveys Zola's fearlessly honest and matter-of-fact style, combining fidelity to Zola's idiosyncrasies with easy fluency in English. This edition also includes an introduction discusses Zola's life and literary career and the influence of art, literature, and science on his writing, as well as the preface to the author's second edition of 1868, a chronology, suggestions for further reading, and notes.", "asin": "0140449442", "rank": "254560", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/516-f%2BIKZAL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
