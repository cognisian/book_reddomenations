C., and its most famous (or infamous) mayor. It is unfortunate that Marion Barry succumbed to drug use, which eclipsed his outstanding record as a mayor of Washington, D. C. Under his administration the downtown area of Washington was built up. The books reveals the underhanding of D. C. politicians who were in office long before Barry was old enough to vote. It is a good book to have in one's personal library."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This book is very well-written, thorough, and engaging, if a bit dry at times. Through covering most of DC's history, focusing mainly on Marion Barry the man and mayor, some important events and decisions are necessarily glossed over. Overall, though, an invaluable resource for anyone seeking to understand the DC political landscape.The Afterword describing the 20 years following the book's initial publication in 1993 is a nice addition, though not as detailed as previous eras covered. Ending in April 2014, just a few months before Marion Barry's death.One major complaint -- far too many spelling, typographical, and layout errors for such a respectable tome. The publisher needs to hire a better copyeditor to go through this edition line by line. Not sure if this problem is limited to the Kindle version or present in print as well."}]}, "authors": ["Harry S.

Jaffe and Sherwood have chillingly chronicled the descent of the District of Columbia\u2014congressional hearings, gangland murders, the establishment of home rule and the inside story of Marion Barry\u2019s enigmatic dynasty and disgrace. Now their afterword narrates the District\u2019s transformation in the last twenty years. New residents have helped bring developments, restaurants, and businesses to reviving neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nThe authors cover the rise and fall of Mayors Adrian Fenty and Vince Gray, how new corruption charges are taking down politicians and businessmen, and how a fading Barry is still a player. The \u201ccity behind the monuments\u201d remains flawed and polarized, but its revival is turning it into a distinct world capital\u2014almost a dream city.\r\n\r\nHarry Jaffe has been a national editor at The Washingtonian magazine since 1990. Tom Sherwood is a reporter for NBC4 in Washington, specializing in politics and the District of Columbia government.
