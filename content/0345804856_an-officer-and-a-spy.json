The true flavors cannot be rushed and require a good 15 years of cellar time before it peeks. Time can be a friend.In 1895, Dreyfus is condemned to life on a deserted island for treason, and Picquart absolutely believes in Dreyfus's guilt. But then, Picquart discovers information that leads him to believe Dreyfus is innocent. More chillingly, the more Picquart tries to do the right thing, the more he realizes that others will stop at nothing to silence him.First of all, when I snagged this book from someone else's reading list, I had (somehow) come to the conclusion that this book was a romance between an officer and a spy. Well, I was wrong. Romance existed in the book, but it was of the most realistic and practical sort. The intertwining story of Dreyfus and Picquart seems to be a real life story of the underdog, fighting against back room political deals. It's both drawn out and action packed.When the book ended, I may have wailed aloud that I wasn't ready to be done. Why? Because I, too, had suffered and triumphed through the ordeal that Dreyfus and Picquart experienced.I recommend it to you if you're interested in pre-WW1 history."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent!

But as an American who lived through the Watergate era, this book shows how that crisis of government culpability and cover-up was compared with the Dreyfus Affair. As this marvelous retelling of the French crisis and scandal shows, the closer parallel might also be the O.J. Simpson trial, for issues of \"race\" ran deep into both, to the detriment of discovering what really happened.  Like both American events, the Dreyfus Affair captured everyone's attention, prejudices and fears in France for years. I learned of this trying to read Proust's volume where 200 pages describe a dinner party where everyone argues Dreyfus, and I realized I'd need to know more history to make sense of it. I did, but this novel is far the most exciting well-done piece for all those curious about this horrific episode."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Important story, written like a thriller, brilliantly researched."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Unique writing style... captivating insights into the intense period of blatant anti-semitism in what one would believe was a sophisticated epoch of French history.

Welcome to 1890s Paris.\r\n \r\nAlfred Dreyfus has been convicted of treason, sentenced to life imprisonment on a far-off island, and publicly stripped of his rank. Among the witnesses to his humiliation is Georges Picquart, an ambitious military officer who believes in Dreyfus's guilt as staunchly as any member of the public. But when he is promoted to head of the French counter-espionage agency, Picquart finds evidence that a spy still remains at large in the military\u2014indicating that Dreyfus is innocent. \r\n\r\nAs evidence of the most malignant deceit mounts and spirals inexorably toward the uppermost levels of government, Picquart is compelled to question not only the case against Dreyfus but also his most deeply held beliefs about his country, and about himself.", "asin": "0345804856", "rank": "49833", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517hMcLQobL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
