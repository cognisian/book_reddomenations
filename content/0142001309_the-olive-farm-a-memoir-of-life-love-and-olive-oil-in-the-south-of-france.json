The author has the talent to write so that paragraphs can be read in one scan. If you have ever seen an old building in the French countryside and thought \"We could fix that up and live here?\", this is your book.  It's a bit different to Peter Mayle's book A Year in Provence, with more focus on growing Olives and the challenges of doing it all while still doing one's day job (in other countries no less ) and with little funds to do it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Funny, poignant, romantic, and entertaining!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Read in one day!

I was captured from the first page. I almost felt like I was in the South of France. She has a whole series of the Olive books and I plan on reading them all. After hearing about her experiences, I don't plan on buying a home in France, however. The regulations and ability to get anything done are killer."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This was my second reading of this wonderful book.

Michel presents their life savings to the real estate broker as a down payment for the farm, embarking the family on an adventure that will bring them in close contact with the charming countryside, querulous personalities, petty bureaucracies, and extraordinary wildlife (including a ravenous wild boar) of Provence. \r\n\r\nIn the spirit of Peter Mayle\u2019s A Year in Provence and Frances Mayes\u2019s Under the Tuscan Sun, The Olive Farm is a splendid tour of southern France, from the glamour of Cannes to the Iles de L\u00e9rins and a Cistercian monastery on the tiny isle of St. Honorat, to Carol Drinkwater\u2019s own small piece of land, which she transforms from an overgrown plot of weeds and ivy to a thriving, productive farm, transforming in the process her own dream of a peaceful and meaningful life into reality.", "asin": "0142001309", "rank": "446956", "city": "Cannes", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sSAIXGR6L.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
