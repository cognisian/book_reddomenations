Moving and atmospheric as usual."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "James Lee Burke is a favorite author of mine. Loved much of his work, but this one is  a mess. If you like endless  maudlin worrying about mortality and endless liberal griping and an endless series of disconnected scenes then this book is for you. But remember, others have said, and I agree, it has a very thin and very unbelievable  plot. To me the conclusions (there were mind-numbing botches)  left me scratching my head. Halfway through I wondered where and how the myriad characters were going and how this jumble  was going to come together. . We have a delusional Dave Robicheaux pondering and fearing death--not just once or twice. Throughout we get his lengthy  introspective on meeting his mother and father on a old time river boat. Vietnam death memories come to play.  In the end Clete joins in Dave's  fears.  Perhaps it's because the writer is approaching his eighth decade (born 1936) as he admits in the book. Alafair has grown up and once again makes friends with unsavory people, including murderers. Except for one scene, Alafair is tiresome. Molly is disgusted with Dave's illusions. Clete going over the top with violence.  As a cop, Dave  lets an admitted murderer slide. There is the old  Nazi war criminal with his own agenda who  wants to kill  Dave, and  oil men who put hits on not only Dave, but Alafair and Molly--which was known to them but they seem to shrug it off. . The oil men are there because of the gulf oil blowout.  The usual creeps like child abusers, women femme fatales,  Mafia figures portrayed as dum-dums, crooked, rapist cops, down-and-out blacks, teen savants, drinkers, rotten corporations that are ruining the wetlands,  helpful hookers, and jolly drug dealers show up. The over-the-top scenes  could not support all these characters resulting in an unsatisfactory story. ."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Long book, rather lame subject matter but the writing is terrific.
