While Buddy Bolden's life unravels in real time, he helps create America's original music: jazz; burning himself out in the process. Set in New Orleans, Ondaatje pulls out all the stops to make this fictional account of Bolden's erratic and flamboyant life sizzle with a jazz structure in its own right. Not a structure suitable to some, but strong writing until the end. Good stuff."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a powerful book telling the story of Buddy Bolton who played coronet during the Storyville era of New Orleans at the turn of the century. Only this skillful poet/author could capture the turmoil, violence, beauty, rhythms, obsessions and self-destruction that permeated this place and time. Bolton was not only a  jazz coronet player but also a barber who knew and passed on all the local gossip. He was an alcoholic addicted to whiskey and in love with two women. The reader watches him as he sinks into more and more depression and manic behavior; his music more wild and frenzied, unique and exciting. Throughout the story the writer brings the reader into Bolton\u2019s music.  He breaks up voice and tone in scenarios with stunning paragraphs and narratives. It gives the book a haunting, frightening quality as Bolton slowly goes insane. This book is unique and brilliant\u2014extremely moving."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I loved this book.  It is beautifully and poetically written.  The format is great and expect it also to be different.

I presented a paper on this book. I totally understand that there is a purpose in writing his book in this way, as he wants to liken his writing with the improvisation of Bolden's life and music."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Truly incredible book.A must read for aspirin artists, musicians, and writers."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The book often gets confusing due to the constantly changing perspective.

Unfortunately, I found Ondaatje's debut almost unbearable: the typical \"let's do it strange\" thing, pretentious, experimental in the worst sense, boring and unable to stir emotions, or at least a little amount of admiration for style or storytelling. Just some interest for the real people the fiction is built around. I won't give Michael a second chance, and I'd better stick to the rule: read an author only when he's dead, if his books are still around."}]}, "authors": ["Michael Ondaatje"], "isbn": "0679767851", "longitude": -90.0701156, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "Coming Through Slaughter", "word_cloud": "phenomenal unique beautiful novel pleasure read much muscular write tight phrase eye detail run riff house fire life unravels real time help original music jazz burn process pull stop make fictional account erratic flamboyant life sizzle jazz structure right not structure suitable strong write end stuff powerful tell story play coronet era turn century only skillful turmoil violence beauty rhythm obsession permeate place time jazz coronet player also barber knew pass local gossip alcoholic addict whiskey woman watch sink depression manic behavior music wild frenzied unique excite story writer bring music break voice tone scenario stun paragraph narrative give haunt frighten quality slowly go unique moving love beautifully poetically write format great expect also different now live mean even always part move place love style present paper totally understand purpose write way want liken write improvisation life music truly incredible artist musicians writer often get confuse due constantly change perspective personally story pretty interesting love jazz love much find recommend buy immediately unfortunately find debut almost unbearable typical let strange thing pretentious experimental worst sense bore unable stir emotion least little amount admiration style storytelling interest real people fiction build second chance better stick rule author dead still", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Historical Fiction"], "summary": "Many readers still claim this haunting, atmospheric novel of Michael Ondaatje's as their first love - a novel as sensual and erotic today as ever it was. \r\n\r\nAt the turn of the century, the Storyville district of New Orleans had some 2000 prostitutes, 70 professional gamblers, and 30 piano players. But it had only one man who played the cornet like Buddy Bolden - he who cut hair by day at N. Joseph's Shaving Parlor, and at night played jazz, unleashing an unforgettable wildness and passion in crowded rooms. Self-destructively in love with two women, he embodied all the dire claims that music places on its acolytes. \r\n\r\nAt the age of 31, Buddy Bolden went mad.
