I underlined so many passages and turned down so many corners to refer to later. My daughter read the book and I need to order her a copy now. It is the kind of book you want to keep, not read and get rid of."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "If you love New Orleans, you will feel like you are eating this book and bonding with a kindred spirit that you never met.

It leaves an otherwise pleasant book on a note of despair and political bitterness. Better to have left this out entirely as it didn't fit the tone of the rest of the book. But that shouldn't dissuade anyone interested in New Orleans and its people and history from reading the first 95%."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Lots of celebratory crap here, of course, but his showpiece \"My City My Wilderness\" is worth the price of the ticket with its pungent mixture of observations.

How apt that a refugee born in Transylvania found his home in a place where vampires roam the streets and voodoo queens live around the corner; where cemeteries are the most popular picnic spots, the ghosts of poets, prostitutes, and pirates are palpable, and in the French Quarter, no one ever sleeps.\r\n\r\nCodrescu's essays have been called \"satirical gems,\" \"subversive,\" \"sardonic and stunning,\" \"funny,\" \"gonzo,\" \"wittily poignant,\" and \"perverse\"\u2014here is a writer who perfectly mirrors the wild, voluptuous, bohemian character of New Orleans itself. This retrospective follows him from newcomer to near native: first seduced by the lush banana trees in his backyard and the sensual aroma of coffee at the caf\u00e9 down the block, Codrescu soon becomes a Window Gang regular at the infamous bar Molly's on Decatur, does a stint as King of Krewe de Vieux Carr\u00e9 at Mardi Gras, befriends artists, musicians, and eccentrics, and exposes the city\u2019s underbelly of corruption, warning presciently about the lack of planning for floods in a city high on its own insouciance. Alas, as we all now know, Paradise is lost.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans, Mon Amour is an epic love song, a clear-eyed elegy, a cultural celebration, and a thank-you note to New Orleans in its Golden Age.", "asin": "1565125053", "rank": "485362", "city": "New Orleans", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Tgg2uFzNL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
