Perhaps because I've been a student of Russian culture for over 50 years I was especially attuned to what Miller had to put up with to travel around in a totalitarian state and get people to tell him the truth.  And the jokes were of the same tenor as Russian jokes!  Unlike some of the negative reviewers I considered Miller's style unobtrusively polished, a little like Paul Theroux.  Many other works on Cuba and Latin America were cited in the text and the book functions as an unofficial bibliography, motivating one to do further reading.  I intend to seek out the other books written by this author."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This book was ok. It gave a nice glimpse of life inside Cuba in the 1990s and some interesting insights into Cuban culture. It wasn't really written in a compelling style and was sort of a pastiche of a travelogue. I came away not really caring much about any of the characters or the author himself."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Thought provoking look at Cuba, the good, the bad and the ugly."}]}, "authors": ["Tom Miller"], "isbn": "0465005039", "longitude": -82.3658671, "periods": ["2000s"], "title": "Trading with the Enemy: A Yankee Travels Through Castro's Cuba", "word_cloud": "write great true story line accurately portray personality culture shortly visit deprecation good information great most interesting long revolution destroy lot canard fact data well personal contact get back first visit rigid spot story teller back change write private restaurant lodge good portrait life good look life beat path long time continuously engross perhaps student russian culture year especially attune put totalitarian state get people tell truth joke tenor russian joke negative reviewer consider style unobtrusively polish little work cite text function unofficial bibliography motivate reading intend seek write author ok give nice glimpse life interest insight culture really write compelling style sort pastiche travelogue come away really care much character author provoke look good bad ugly", "genres": ["Travel Writing", "Politics"], "summary": "\u201cHavana knew me by my shoes,\u201d begins Tom Miller\u2019s lively and entertaining account of his sojourn for more than eight months traveling through Cuba, mixing with its literati and black marketers, its cane cutters and cigar rollers. Granted unprecedented access to travel throughout the country, the author presents us with a rare insight into one of the world\u2019s only Communist countries. Its best-known personalities and ordinary citizens talk to him about the U.S. embargo and tell their favorite Fidel jokes as they stand in line for bread at the Socialism or Death Bakery. Miller provides a running commentary on Cuba\u2019s food shortages, exotic sensuality, and baseball addiction as he follows the scents of Graham Greene, Jos\u00e9 Marti, Ernest Hemingway, and the Mambo Kings. The result of this informed and adventurous journey is a vibrant, rhythmic portrait of a land and people too long shielded from American eyes.", "asin": "0465005039", "rank": "432501", "city": "Havana", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51hRMuOKuDL.jpg", "country": "Cuba", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
