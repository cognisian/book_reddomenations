The patriarch, Kweku, deserts the family in Boston and never explains that he has been fired as the chief surgeon.  He became the scapegoat after he was unable to save the life of a member of a very powerful family.  He leaves his wife, Fola, their son, twins and youngest daughter.  The reader is allowed to dip into all of their lives and see how each suffers from his absence.  Years later, he dies after hearing that Fola has moved to Ghana where he is living with his second wife. Their children travel to Ghana to attend his funeral and  they bond as a unit. Selasi uses a unique method of storytelling and her wisdom leaves much to chew on."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Perfect, clean and frankly new"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Loved this book.

I am a religious book reader and being that im from Ghana I was very proud and excited to read this book but it just didnt catch me. Maybe this book is for the older people (im 27) but I was bored and uninterested i felt like my grandmother who is into poems and somehing would have enjoyed it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "If, like me, you find yourself bogged down a time or two, or discouraged by the seeming disjointedness, take heart.  The last third brings it together and brings it home.Home to the human condition.  Family love and heartbreak, human ambition and the wreckage it can make, wanting to belong and, in this globalized world, wanting not to belong, art and devastation, the longing to salvage meaning from the struggle, it's all here.Clearly written by a woman, but with a lot of insight into the male heart, too.  Selasie has that rare gift, a feel for how life feels, and she uses it judiciously and artfully to bring a hundred flashes of insight and a few powerful scenes.The family was devastated by an injustice in the heart of an institution that should have been safe from such abuse.  The stresses that built up in the years of reaching that position just washed the family solidarity away.  The mother's resulting depression led to even more betrayal.  And many years later, the family gets together for the father's funeral, and secrets come out.If that sounds melodramatic, then I have misled by encapsulating.  The most striking thing about \"Ghana Must Go\" is the texture, the feeling that life's disappointments and frustrations are given subtle shape by the postures we have taken, but given life and meaning by the inner self which, in a real way, we all share."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book is MUST READ!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I love African writers, No-Violet Bulawayo, Pettinah Gappah, Chimamanda Ngozi-Adichie......and Ive just addedd Taiye Selasie.
