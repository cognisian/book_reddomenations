The story is nothing remarkable. The lead character, Verloc, lives in England and runs a shop that sells disreputable goods. He lives with his wife, her mentally challenged brother and her mother. Verloc is secretly employed by another European power. Anarchists are planting bombs all throughout Europe, and Verloc\u2019s employer is concerned that England does not take the anarchist threat seriously enough.Verloc is ordered to make a strike that will wake up England to the need to be more vigilant against terrorism. Specifically, he is ordered to make a symbolic strike against science by destroying a famed observatory. The local police are watching his shop and other anarchists, and the inspector, Heat, who is watching that group, has to report to an assistant commissioner who doesn\u2019t want to move against one of its members because doing so would disrupt the social circle.Verloc uses his wife\u2019s challenged brother to place the explosive, but the brother stumbles and dies horrifically. When Mrs. Verloc learns what happens, Verloc makes a confession of sorts, but doesn\u2019t realize how she cared for him. She kills him and tries to flee with one of his comrades who, instead, takes her savings. She ends up committing suicide.That\u2019s more or less it for the plot. Verloc is the most completely drawn character, and Mrs. Verloc, too, is complete. Heat, the inspector, is believable. The rest are generally placeholders. Why is it so great? Is it the first exposition of modern terrorism? I suppose that could be it. Is it because the way Conrad writes -- sentences that are annoying at first but, when you come to live with that language, they become unbelievably insightful into human motivations -- makes any full-length work of his something that has to be read? Maybe."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Timeline is to bizarre."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is both like and unlike other Conrad novels.  It takes place in a dark and dismal London populated by ineffectual anarchists, one of whom accidentally kills his brother-in-law, who is mentally incapacitated, in a botched attempt at a terrorist bombing, and is in turn killed by his wife.  The characters are just that, characters, their psychology painstakingly described, and the vision gloomy.  It is well worth reading."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A classic!  You won't be disappointed.

Acutely aware of his country-bumpkin status, he struggles with the modernity of Tokyo and its people, especially the young women, who enjoy freedoms that their provinicial counterparts do not. While walking around the University's famous pond one day, Sanshiro sees a beautiful girl and is lovestruck. He learns her name is Mineko, and because she is the younger sister of one of his fellow students he soon meets and befriends her. In the end, utterly unable to express his feelings to Mineko or even relate to her as a human being rather than a goddess, Sanshiro loses her to another man. But there's much more to novel than his unrequited love: there are university politics, real politics (Japan having recently won the Russo-Japanese War), and the constant tension between the feudal society that Sanshiro's elders were born into and the modern society that has supplanted it. Sanshiro's coming of age is also his country's, with all the attendant growing pains. The novel is fascinating for several reasons: first, the descriptions of Tokyo University are apt more than a century later, as I can attest after spending a day on campus in May. The pond, now called Sanshiro's Pond, is still a magnet for students and visitors, as is the famous Red Gate and the allee of old gingko trees beyond it. Second is the subplot about a student movement to appoint the University's first Japanese professor of English literature. In real life, that professor was Soseki himself, who famously took over the post of the Irish-Cypriot writier Lafcadio Hearn before resigning to write fiction. Last but not least, I found echos of \"Sanshiro\" in not one but two novels by Haruki Murakami: \"Norwegian Wood\" and \"South of the Border, West of the Sun.\" Murakami has long said that Soseki is his favorite writer, and in reading \"Sanshiro\" I understood the enormity of Murakami's debt to him."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "great quality"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I love the depth of Conrad's characters and the intricate plot lines they follow.

The innocent victims this poor man takes with him is another example of the tyranny of the Fascist regimes Sinclair despises.

The story is woven around an attack on the Greenwich Observatory in 1894 masterminded by Verloc, a Russian spy working for the police, and ostensibly a member of an anarchist group in Soho. His masters instruct him to discredit the anarchists in a humiliating fashion, and when his evil plan goes horribly awry, Verloc must deal with the repercussions of his actions. While rooted in the Edwardian period, Conrad's tale remains strikingly contemporary, with its depiction of Londoners gripped by fear of the terrorists living in their midst.", "asin": "0141441585", "rank": "84773", "city": "London", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41FvBnjzC%2BL.jpg", "country": "England", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
