The author provides much personal information about Ralph Lemkin and Hersch Lauterpach, chronicling their early history and their respective contributions to international criminal law.

It describes and analyses the inhumanity (perhaps that depravity cannot be called \"inhumanity\" since humans perpetrated it) of some humans against some others.  It raises the question whether, in the darkest corners of our minds, we all may really believe that some humans have a greater right than some others, to exist on this planet.

We have in Sands\u2019s East West Street a machine of power and beauty that should not be ignored by anyone in the United States or elsewhere who would believe that there are irreparable crimes whose adjudication should not stop at the border. . . .
