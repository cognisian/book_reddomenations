My French wasn't so good, and my progress was slow, but the book nonetheless struck me as funny and wonderfully off-kilter. The prose style was playful, but also clear. It didn't hurt that the historical era Barthes was talking about wasn't so far removed from my own awareness (I was born during the period when the articles were written). His way of looking at everything precisely, but from an unorthodox perspective and with a sense of ironic humor, had a deep influence on my own writing when I started writing a magazine column a few decades later. More recently, it's also influenced my teaching.I came to this translation thinking of assigning some essays as reading for college students in a business program. It didn't take long to ditch that idea: this translation would make it too tough for most of them to share my enthusiasm. The historical distance of the subject matter wasn't the problem -- some annotations and illustrations could help with that. In fact, one of the benefits of this edition is a small insert of illustrations to help the 21st Century reader visualize what Barthes was writing about. Many essays also have a short introductory footnote on their first page, providing historical context. The real problem is with the tone of the translation -- it makes Barthes sound insufferably pretentious and fussy. If you've ever been to a university party where some middle-aged professor is getting carried away with the sound of his own voice, it's a bit like that. If I'd begun with this version instead of the original, I'm sure I'd have gotten impatient with it about a third of the way through.Given how shaky my French was when I read the book the first time, I wondered whether maybe this translation captured the essence of Barthes, to which I'd been insensitive earlier. I've read a lot more French since then, including some dull and pretentious stuff. But when I checked now, Barthes still isn't that. Despite occasional flourishes (but precise ones), his vocabulary is mostly pretty clear -- which is how I managed to make it all the way through so many years ago. His sentences are long and full of clauses, but they have a rhythm lacking here.One particular issue I noticed from a random comparison is that the translators often distort the syntax that gave structure and poise to the French original. Here is an example from one of the more political essays, \"The Cruise of the 'Batory',\" contrasting the magazine Le Figaro's coverage of a 1955 French cruise taking tourists to visit the USSR with that of the refusal of some French soldiers to fight in Algeria. According to the magazine, the cruise had given the Russians a glimpse of a sort of cheerful anarchy and individualism among the disorderly French. Barthes's original essay ends as follows:\u00ab Lorsque quatre cents rappel\u00e9s de l\u2019arm\u00e9e de l\u2019Air ont refus\u00e9, un dimanche, de partir pour l\u2019Afrique de Nord, _Le Figaro_ n\u2019 a plus parl\u00e9 d\u2019anarchie sympathique et d\u2019individualisme enviable : comme il ne s\u2019agissait plus ici de mus\u00e9e ou de m\u00e9tro, mais bien de gros sous coloniaux, le \u201cd\u00e9sordre\u201d n\u2019\u00e9tait plus, tout d\u2019un coup, le fait d\u2019une glorieuse vertu gauloise, mais le produit artificiel de quelques \u201cmeneurs\u201d ; ile n\u2019\u00e9tait plus prestigieux mais _lamentable_, et la _monumentale indiscipline_ des Fran\u00e7ais, lou\u00e9e tout a l\u2019heure de clins d\u2019oeil loustics et vaniteux, est devenue sur la route d\u2019Algerie, trahison honteuse. _Le Figaro_ connait bien sa bourgeoisie: la libert\u00e9 en vitrine, \u00e0 titre d\u00e9coratif, mais l\u2019Ordre chex soi, \u00e0 titre constitutif. \u00bbHere is the translation in this edition:\u201cWhen four hundred Air Force veterans, called up for North African service, refused to serve one Sunday, _Le Figaro_ no longer spoke of the sympathetic anarchy and enviable individualism of the French: no longer any question here of museum or metro, but rather of colonial investments and big money; whereupon \u2018disorder\u2019 was no longer the phenomenon of a glorious Gallic virtue but the artificial product of a few \u2018agents\u2019; it was no longer glamorous but _lamentable_ and the _monumental lack of discipline_ of the French, formerly praised with so many waggish and self-satisfied winks, has become, on the road to Algeria, a shameful treason. _Le Figaro_ knows its bourgeoisie: freedom out front, on display, but Order back home, a constitutive necessity.\u201d (@148)A few observations about this translation:(a) In the first sentence of the passage Barthes strings together three sentences into one - but each clause is a complete sentence. One translation strategy might have been to punctuate the passage differently as two or three distinct sentences. Instead H&L; retain the one-sentence structure but make the flow choppier by subdividing into into four chained clauses, including two sentence fragments (\u201cno longer any question here \u2026\u201d and \u201cwhereupon\u2026\u201d). In doing so, they also make it hard for the reader to see the causal relationship between the topics of those two fragments. Compare a translation of Barthes\u2019s middle clause roughly as follows: \u201cas it was no longer a matter of museum or metro, but of big colonial bucks, \u2018disorder\u2019 suddenly wasn\u2019t the result of a glorious Gallic virtue but the manufactured product of a few \u2018agents\u2019\u201d.(b) H&L; insert formal and lengthy words where they weren\u2019t present in the original: e.g., \u201cwhereupon\u201d rather than \u201csuddenly\u201d for \u2018tout a l\u2019heure,\u2019 \u201ca constitutive necessity\u201d for the adjective \u2018constitutif,\u2019 \u201cphenomenon\u201d rather than \u201cresult\u201d for \u2018fait,\u2019 and \u201ccolonial investments and big money\u201d for the intentionally coarse \u2018gros sous coloniaux\u2019 (as in \u201cbig colonial bucks,\u201d \u201ccolonial big money\u201d or something similar).(c) In the last sentence, H&L; erase Barthes\u2019s balanced contrast of freedom and order as reflected in the parallel syntax of the concluding clauses. They also downplay his irony by omitting the adverb \u201cbien\u201d (\u2018well\u2019), and ignoring the bourgeois resonances of \u201cvitrine,\u201d connoting a shop window.  Something closer to the sense of Barthes\u2019s last sentence might be: \u201c_Le Figaro_ knows its bourgeoisie well: freedom on display in the shop window, as decoration, but Order at home, as foundation.\u201dAll in all, the translators\u2019 choices make Barthes seem much more pompous and distant from the reader than he really was; and in passages like the one just quoted, they also downplay his political engagement.Many reviewers here on Amazon managed to enjoy this book despite the problems I've described.

The book consists of fifty-three short essays on the \"material culture\" of 50s France and the structure of its interpretation in the French media, with a long \"theoretical\" essay, \"Myth Today\", appended. When the original English translation came out in 1972, nearly half of the short pieces were expurged. This was at the beginning of the \"theory\" craze in English-speaking countries, and it might have been felt that essays on already-dated aspects of French life might stifle appreciation of Barthes' semiological pronunciamentos. The decision by Hill and Wang to present the entire work in a new translation is to be deeply appreciated; Barthes distinguishes himself from other \"foggy froggies\" in the exquisite pointillism of his writing on topics as mundane as detergent or plastic.Really, at this stage of his career Barthes resembled nobody outside *l'Hexagone* more than Adorno, and even does the dismal German one better in a political pungency visible on every other page: in 1957 France was in the process of being divested of its colonies, and confronted domestically with one M. Poujade, a know-nothing political populist trying to rally small businessmen against 'the swamp'. (Barthes was clearly not beholden to a \"party line\" but he came up with many good lines himself; \"politically committed\" people who have reflexively dismissed him as an effete aesthete have to see what he does with the material of everyday oppression which Althusser handled far more \"mechanically\".) Furthermore, those who bemoan Criticism Today have not much to blame him for, as any time 'high culture' comes up in the book it is handled in a supernaturally deft manner.

Roland Barthes wrote in his preface to Mythologies. There is no more proper instrument of analysis of our contemporary myths than this book\u2015one of the most significant works in French theory, and one that has transformed the way readers and philosophers view the world around them.\r\n\r\nOur age is a triumph of codification. We own devices that bring the world to the command of our fingertips. We have access to boundless information and prodigious quantities of stuff. We decide to like or not, to believe or not, to buy or not. We pick and choose. We think we are free. Yet all around us, in pop culture, politics, mainstream media, and advertising, there are codes and symbols that govern our choices. They are the fabrications of consumer society. They express myths of success, well-being, or happiness. As Barthes sees it, these myths must be carefully deciphered, and debunked.\r\n\r\nWhat Barthes discerned in mass media, the fashion of plastic, and the politics of postcolonial France applies with equal force to today's social networks, the iPhone, and the images of 9/11. This new edition of Mythologies, complete and beautifully rendered by the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning poet, critic, and translator Richard Howard, is a consecration of Barthes's classic\u2015a lesson in clairvoyance that is more relevant now than ever.", "asin": "0809071940", "rank": "22520", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B0ANBVQQL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
