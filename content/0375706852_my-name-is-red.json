These are so ingeniously depicted that I'm surprised the book hasn't become celebrated as a work which lets a reader glimpse into a culture foreign to most contemporary Westerners.The theme of Turkey's divide between East and West, as exemplified in the work of figurative manuscripts, is best read for oneself rather than summarized.  Other themes such as the nature of art itself, the relationship between art and Islam and the relationships between master and pupil are strewn throughout the work.  All the while Pamuk tells such a compelling story that the narrative could have been published without this philosophical depth.There is a lot more that could be said about this novel: its serious themes right along playful asides that keep the novel from being too ponderous, the surprisingly realistic characters in a work of historical fiction (although the artists sometimes seem superhuman-Pamuk is an artist himself after all), the honest depiction of both the glories and depravities of Ottoman culture but, again, its best to discover these on your own than have someone provide spoilers of Pamuk's masterpiece.In brief, if you are looking for literary fiction which also depicts a largely unknown culture (except to Turks) you could hardly find a better choice.  If you are looking for an interesting mystery, you will find it but hopefully you will also take in this fascinating depiction of Ottoman culture."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book gives the feel of Turkey viewing Italy in 1590 just as Romola by George Eliot gives the feel of Italy viewing Turkey in the same decade.The two books also lay bare many of the religious struggles in the respective regions, including orthodoxy, blasphemy, heresy, and (more in Romola) true faith.In Romola the activity is the gathering of ancient texts. Ironically in Europe, Aristotle had been newly recovered because the Muslims had kept it safe and Averoes brought it back to Europe. There are texts of Platonists being gathered, like Ficino and Cabalists. The priest, Savanarola is a character and so is Machiavelli.In My Name is Red, the activity is the drawing and coloring of book illustrations. This mirrors the activity of text-gathering in Romola.I think someone could write some good thesis papers comparing these two books."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I liked the way the story is told through not only people but also anthropomorphized concepts.

Their task: to illuminate the work in the European style. But because figurative art can be deemed an affront to Islam, this commission is a dangerous proposition indeed. The ruling elite therefore mustn\u2019t know the full scope or nature of the project, and panic erupts when one of the chosen miniaturists disappears. The only clue to the mystery\u2013or crime? \u2013lies in the half-finished illuminations themselves. Part fantasy and part philosophical puzzle, My Name is Red is a kaleidoscopic journey to the intersection of art, religion, love, sex and power.
