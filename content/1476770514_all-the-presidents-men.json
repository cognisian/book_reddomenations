While this book certainly tells the tale of what is perhaps still the most consequential feat of 20th-century journalism, it is not a nonfiction book that reads like a novel. It is, however, worth the read, if only to provide hope given the current chaotic mess that is the US Executive branch of government.The factors that prevent All the President\u2019s Men from achieving the lauded \u201creads like a novel\u201d status are perhaps beyond the control of Bernstein and Woodward, who prove themselves to be intrepid, reflective reporters who are not above admitting their own shortcomings or lapses in judgment. The story they uncover is such a byzantine quagmire of conflicting loyalties, stealthy connections, cloak-and-dagger schemes, and downright preposterous (yet true) accusations against the most esteemed government office in the US that one forgives them for failing to weave an intelligible plot out of the Gordian knot of intrigue that they discover. Furthermore, Bernstein and Woodward are not necessarily storytellers\u2014they are journalists telling the story of their story.Over 40 years after the Watergate scandal, the paranoia, hypocrisy, and dishonesty that emanated from the office of the President of the United States feel all too palpable in the current era, when we are forced to endure what will undoubtedly be regarded as the most ignorant, embarrassing, arrogant, appalling, and absolutely batsh*t crazy administration of all time. I simply hope that somewhere, working for a newspaper or website like the Washington Post, there are journalists in the mold of Bernstein and Woodward who will someday tell the story of 45\u2019s corruption and reveal him for the criminal that he is."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Good read"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A wonderfully well written narrative that is at once a political thriller and a day by day record of two journalists and their contribution to what became an historic event, namely, the downfall and resignation of a US President."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Currently reading the book, which is such a great read.

It's easy for people like me, born long after Watergate, to not grasp how shocking all of this was at the time, or to let our later knowledge of Nixon's corruption color our understanding of his downfall as inevitable. But the truth is that Richard Nixon was a very popular president (winning 49 states when he ran for reelection even though the Watergate burglary was already common knowledge), and no one could have predicted where the Post story would lead. Woodward and Bernstein place us squarely in the context of that time, documenting every step of their quest to discover who was pulling the strings behind Watergate in the face of enormous political pressure and initial public disinterest. It's a fascinating story of the relentless pursuit of truth, and a clarion call for all journalists to put that pursuit over politics."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Read this book with one eye on the current Trump administration.
