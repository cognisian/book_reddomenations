This is part of the series called the <i>Tempe Brenner \u2013 Forensic Anthropologist</i>.  This paragraph applies to all books in this series.  Tempe is a anthropologist who works for medical examiners in Montreal, Quebec and Charlotte North CarolineEven though the books are often very detailed in both location and the examination of the remains, the story often moves faster than you expect.Do you need to read this series in order:  YES or you miss out on too much of the back stories.Triggers: This is a book about medical examiners at its core, so lots of references to dead bodies, some are described in strong detail (in a forensic way).Our anthropologist ends up in some life threatening situations and on a couple of occasions in the series, animals are killed, sometimes gratuitously.  Relatives of Tempe often in up wounded as the bad persons try to get to her through her family.The skeleton is that of a young girl, no more than fourteen years old - and forensic anthropologist Dr Temperance Brennan is struggling to keep her emotions in check. Coroner Yves Bradette is being evasive, insisting the bones are ancient and of no interest. But it doesn't quite add up, and a frustrated Tempe is convinced that Bradette is hiding something. It's not Tempe's case; she's overwhelmed with more urgent work in the lab. But the nagging in her subconscious won't let up. A memory triggered, deep in her hindbrain - the disappearance of a childhood friend; no warning, no explanation. Working on instinct, Tempe takes matters into her own hands. But she couldn't have predicted where this case would lead, or the horrors it would eventually uncover. Can Tempe maintain a professional distance as the past catches up with her in this, her most deeply personal case yet?"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The Temperance Brennan books by Kathy Reichs - which led to the series Bones - are a great mix of real science, fun fiction, characters you like (and a few you don't) and looks at two geographical regions.
