Better than the second. A great author ( with an EDITOR ) would have combined the three into a single 600/650 page tome. By the time you make it to this one you\u2019re just tired of the tortures, poisoning, lost loves, and life in general, in Barcelona. My 2 biggest complaints. 1) one single mention of World War One!!?? And 2) For a trilogy named \u2018Cemetery of Forgotten Books\u2019 not much really took place in that building. Much, much more could have been written about the cemetery of books forgotten."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Fantastic! The series - Cemetary of Forgotten Books is wonderful!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Great book - last one I read from the series. I love the characters and the writing style, couldn't let go of the book. It gets 4 stars because the first 2 are better. The ending of the book feels quite rushed."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Ruiz is surely a genius. These books are beautifully written. I was carried away to Barcelona even though I\u2019ve never been there. This is a modern day classic and will surely be in the list of books you must read before you die.

I'd read the first two Zafon novels and hoped this would be of the same caliber.  In my opinion, it was not.  As others have said, the ending was abrupt and enigmatic.  I often prefer a novel or a movie to conclude open-endedly because it puts the task of an ending in my hands (or mind).  In this case, however, Zafon did not offer enough information, at least for me to enjoy working with my own creative conclusions.The author continues to entertain with his humor and horror and mystery.  I enjoyed reading more about Fermin who was introduced in Shadow of the Myst.My recommendation to those who have not read the first two books of the series is this:  Read them and fall in love with this tremendous author. They can each stand on their own.  Above all, don't start reading Zafon with this novel.  Better yet, as another reviewer has said, wait until the author completes The Prisoner of the Wind. It would be a mistake to judge his other work on the basis of this one."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Good Read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Wonderful story line.
