Laughter in the Dark gives a new perspective and makes the reader consider the love they are searching for, if any. The author, Vladimir Nabokov, is an intelligent man with a writing style that keeps the reader entertained. Vladimir takes us on a trip through the typical mid-life crisis but it winds up feeling like our own. Vladimir's writing makes the reader invested in Albinus's life and you wind up questioning his decisions and showing just as much emotion as Albinus does. Albinus suffers through heartbreak and denial that he created for himself. He left his wife for his 17 year old mistress, but doesn't know if she's worth it. Eventually throughout the story his mistress, Margot, finds her old ex-lover. A love triangle comes into play and the rest of the story involves wealth, death, and fake love. Laughter in the Dark provides an entertaining read where Vladimir attempts to conquer the mysteries of fate and the mental decisions we make for someone who doesn't love us."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Vladimir Nabokov is one of my favorite authors. Laughter in the Dark was a great read with an unexpected twist."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "*Spoilers*Actually, no need for a spoilers alert since Nabokov proceeds to tell us the entire plot in the first paragraph. By this ingenious opening, the interest is no longer in what's going to happen so much as how. Also, the interest comes in learning the specific details to what is a common story.This novel reminded me of Josef Von Sternberg's film The Blue Angel (1930) which came out two years earlier. It is almost cinematic with its short scenes and chapters, its concise use of imagery, and its pithy dialogue.Reading it, I couldn't help but admire the masterful use of prose while at the same time watching a train hurtling towards a cliff.Lastly, I found Margot and Rex to be frightening characters, especially Rex with his depravity."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "In the novel, Laughter in the Dark, Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s writing explores the secrecy and betrayal of affairs and the crumbling effect that comes with discovering the truth, targeting a young-adult audience and leaves the reader curiously wondering if their \u201cunder the radar\u201d love will bring happiness or pain.  A man, named Albinus, once had everything he could want, a family, money, and respect, but ends up with nothing in the end.  But how can a man lose everything in only one year?  Nabokov keeps the reader engaged in the beginning and end of the book, but lacks significant substance in the middle.  On the contrary to some ravishing reviews, many readers feel that Laughter in the Dark does not live up to Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s previous works and was seen to be too predictable."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "While the beginning and end fly by, the middle wanes to a painfully slow pace.

He was rich, respectable, happy; one day he abandoned his wife for the sake of a youthful mistress; he loved; was not loved; and his life ended in disaster.\" Thus begins Vladimir Nabokov's Laughter in the Dark; this, the author tells us, is the whole story\u2015except that he starts from here, with his characteristic dazzling skill and irony, and brilliantly turns a fable into a chilling, original novel of folly and destruction. \r\n\r\nAmidst a Weimar-era milieu of silent film stars, artists, and aspirants, Nabokov creates a merciless masterpiece as Albinus, an aging critic, falls prey to his own desires, to his teenage mistress, and to Axel Rex, the scheming rival for her affections who finds his greatest joy in the downfall of others.\r\n\r\nPublished first in Russian as Kamera Obskura in 1932, this book appeared in Nabokov's own English translation six years later. This New Directions edition, based on the text as Nabokov revised it in 1960, features a new introduction by Booker Prize-winner John Banville.", "asin": "0679724508", "rank": "347837", "city": "Berlin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41k-gJ3uy4L.jpg", "country": "Germany", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
