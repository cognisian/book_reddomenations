Zenia is smart and beautiful, by turns manipulative, vulnerable \u2013 and irresistible. She has entered into their separate lives to ensnare their sympathy, betray their trust, and exploit their weaknesses. \r\n\r\nNow Zenia, thought dead, has suddenly reappeared. In this richly layered narrative, Atwood skilfully evokes the decades of the past as she retraces three women\u2019s lives, until we are back in the present \u2013 where it\u2019s yet to be discovered whether Zenia\u2019s \u201cpure, free-wheeling malevolence\u201d can still wreak havoc. \r\n\r\nThe Robber Bride reports from the farthest reaches of the sex wars and is one of Margaret Atwood\u2019s most intricate and subversive novels yet.\r\n", "asin": "0385491034", "rank": "38768", "city": "Toronto", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51EwvRTnWWL.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
