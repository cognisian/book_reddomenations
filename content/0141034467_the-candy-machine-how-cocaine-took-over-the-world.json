He goes far beyond the damage caused by the trade, choosing instead to focus on the complicity of the \"war on drugs.\"Although primarily focusing on the United States (which makes sense given that the highest usage of cocaine takes place here), Feiling also explores the migration of cocaine production and smuggling routes, from South America to the Caribbean, to Mexico.This is fairly up-to-date information with statistics up to 2008 included.  He is heavy on the details, however, so if you are searching for a light read, this isn't it.  But if you find the subject as fascinating as I do, you'll enjoy Feiling's efforts here."}]}, "authors": ["Tom Feiling"], "isbn": "0141034467", "longitude": -75.573553, "periods": ["2000s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "The Candy Machine: How Cocaine Took Over the World", "word_cloud": "reality drug war usual lot country absolutely outstanding account drug le damage many legal extremely well research write anyone research stories impressive scary consider latest testimony newly apprehend dead insight business need understand people kill mexican drug war year outstanding certeza melhor liver we j lee sober com\u00e9rcio legal auto con segue tier impartial e t\u00e9cnico pro memo fatso no maid variant canto be carol visor progressista realist e liberal auto levando convidando o leitores format opinion sober dodo we apreciem leitura sober servo formula\u00e7ao publican we visa an social write fabulously comprehensive look rise fall rise trade go far damage cause trade choose instead complicity war drug primarily focus make sense give highest usage take place also explore migration production smuggle route fairly information statistic include detail however search light find subject fascinating enjoy ceiling effort", "genres": ["History"], "summary": "Cocaine is big business and getting bigger. Governments spend millions on an unwinnable war against it, yet it's now the drug of choice in the West. How did the cocaine economy get so huge? Who keeps it running behind the scenes?\r\n\r\nIn The Candy Machine Tom Feiling travels the trade routes from Colombia via Miami, Kingston and Tijuana to London and New York. He meets Medillin hitmen, US kingpins, Brazilian traffickers, and talks to soldiers and narcotics officers who fight the gangs and cartels. He traces cocaine's progress from legal 'pick-me-up' to luxury product to global commodity, looks at legalization programmes in countries such as Switzerland, and shows how America's anti-drugs crusade is actually increasing demand.\r\n\r\nCutting through the myths about the white market, this is the story of cocaine as it's never been told before.", "asin": "0141034467", "rank": "2130481", "city": "Medellin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51yMun3umVL.jpg", "country": "Colombia", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
