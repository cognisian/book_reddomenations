Corporations continue to grow and look for new, improved ways of hanging on to clients and have more pull and power than does the political system.  Here, individuals become corporations themselves, and social media is more 'real' (certainly more safe) than the outside world.Kendra is an art school drop-out and sellout.  She's become a walking billboard for a soft drink company - their logo shines through her skin and she's constantly craving the drink.  Toby is a video blogger who likes to think of himself as little more of a rebel than he probably is. Lerator is an AIDS-baby who works for a major corporation as one of their best programmers, but she gets a high from hacking.  And there is Tendeka, the rebel who pulls together the others and tries to cut short the strings of the corporations to the everyday people.The story is told from all four points of view, alternating by chapter.Of the Lauren Beukes books that I've read, this has so far been my least favorite.  There are many similarities with Zoo Story - mostly with the setting and the technology running amok ideas - perhaps this is becoming her signature, but because of the alternating points of view, the story becomes much more fractured.  I never quite bond with any of the characters because just when I felt I was about to understand them and see their side of things, I'd be switched to someone else's view.Because Beukes is so original, I spent a fair amount of time just grasping on to new concepts and trying to understand the world and the technology. Add this to the jumping points of view and I really struggled to get to know the people who mattered in the story.  Because for all her concepts, Beukes still writes about people and human behavior.  And without my connection to them, the story didn't have the impact that it should.I want to read this again.  Knowing now how the story is presented, and now more familiar with the setting, I think I'd be ready to pick up more on the characters' story.  But for a one-time reading, this just doesn't quite work.Looking for a good book? Lauren Beukes reaches out into some new territory once again, with <em>Moxyland</em>, but the fractured story-telling style keeps the reader from becoming fully vested.I received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I started this book, thinking how interesting it is because it's set in a dystopian world where being disconnected from your online device is almost like a death punishment. Very cool idea, and I enjoyed reading how the characters interacted in this new world. The only problem I have is that none of the characters in this book are really that likable. That might be on purpose but it makes it really difficult to keep reading when you can't connect with any of the main characters. Even the guy that wants to lead a revolution is kind of annoying to listen to in your head after just a few pages in his POV. I will try out Zoo City and see if it's any better err"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I very much enjoyed this book - it's an original take on a near-future dystopia, and I love that it's not the standard American setting. Science fiction set in Africa is interesting and exciting, and the cultural background was (imo) well portrayed. Very Blade Runner in feel, dark but not doom-saying. Would recommend."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Interesting, but didn't really float my boat. Ended rather abruptly."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "When I read Neuromancer, I thought that cyberpunk was just way too technical for me. I didn't major in computer science, I'm not a programmer, and you're going to completely lose me with all that sort of jargon. But then I read Snow Crash, and I felt like I \"got it.\" Moxyland is written more along that sort of vein: there's an element of grit and seediness amidst all the shiny future tech, and that is the sort of cyberpunk that I can get on board with.Beukes's world-building in Moxyland is impressive in how believable a future it seems to be. People today are already reliant on technology for nearly everything, and the way many people treat their phones, you'd think they were natural appendages. Moxyland takes all of that, but one step further.Now, while the stories and the world-building held real interest for me, I didn't find myself all that invested in some of the characters...All that being said, I still enjoyed reading Moxyland. Despite not being overly engaged by the characters themselves, their stories were interesting and I appreciated Beukes bringing aspects of actual Cape Town flavor (particularly slang) to her world's youth culture, instead of inventing something completely new for the sake of futuristic world-building. I thought that lent a more authentic sense to the possible reality of her world. If you're interested at all in things like corporate take-over dystopia or cyberpunk in general, I'd recommend giving this a try. It's not a book I really see myself RE-reading, but I'm certainly not sorry I picked it up. There are some interesting twists at the end...For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I really struggled through this book, it was very difficult to find any context for the story as there was no indication of the history behind the situation that the characters found themselves in, you realize that it is a form of rebellion against a form of control, but no idea why."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I spent the time in this book feeling disoriented while also spotting and leaning into ideas and concepts that seemed both possible, if not eventualities. This is a book that you plunge into an see where it takes you. I was pleasantly surprised by the layering of politics and pop culture, African specific memories and points of reference, and interesting characters. Well done!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I\u2019d been wanting to read this for awhile because the cover art looked nifty, but the reviews on Amazon weren\u2019t terribly stellar so I was hesitant. One of Beukes newer books, Broken Monsters, however, has been garnering a ton of really great press recently, so I figured what probably happened is that Beukes has writing chops out the wazoo, but there was a fundamental flaw in the plot of this particular story.I love dissecting stories and seeing what worked and what didn\u2019t, so I hopped into Moxy Land after rustling it up for next to zero money\u2019s on Amazon. Cheap is good. I like cheap.As I suspected the writing for Moxy Land was fantastic. Beukes took an incredibly difficult narrative style (alternating first person points of view every other chapter) and made it work pretty darn well. It\u2019s rare to see alternating first person points of view because what tends to happen is that the characters all become a blur. They all start sounding alike and acting alike. Bad news where compelling narrative is involved.But Lauren somehow makes it work. Each of her 4 point of view characters is distinct enough to remain engaging. That alone is impressive and speaks to her impressive writing chops.Moxy Land doesn\u2019t rest on the strength of the writing, however. The world building is superb. It\u2019s gritty and multi-layered with a depth that shows Beukes really knows what she\u2019s talking about.What I\u2019m about to say next might upset some people \u2018 cause I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t word it correctly and it\u2019ll bring a shit-storm of hate in its wake. I\u2019m prepared for that, but I\u2019ll tread carefully.The best Science Fiction/Fantasy women authors recently have been garnering a lot of attention for their unique and progressive takes on gender roles and sexual orientations and the cultural effects of those two dynamics on future societies: think Kameron Hurley\u2019s The Mirror Empire, or Anne Leckie\u2019s Ancillary Justice.Don\u2019t get me wrong, these are very important ideas with much fertile soil to be tilled. I think the genre as a whole is only strengthened by these types of works. But, my problem with these plot devices is that they become the entire plot. Sure, there is a story taking place underneath it all, but it\u2019s being blurred over.When people talk about Mirror Empire they talk about the unique matriarchal societies. When people talk about Ancillary Justice, they talk about the fact that Leckie only uses the feminine pronoun. What gets lost in all the hullaballoo is the story itself.That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but I tend to be a story guy. (Which, let me point out for those wondering, both of those books have great stories, but nobody ever talks about them. Only the gender issues.)Now, back to Moxy Land and Lauren Beukes, who is one of new favorite sci-fi women authors precisely because she doesn\u2019t let her story get bogged down by those facets of modern Sci-Fi which are quickly becoming tropes. There are compelling sexual orientations throughout the story, but they are flavoring which add a touch of realism, and not the point of the story itself.The problem with Moxy Land, however, is that the story moves really slowly. Things are happening, but with so many point of view characters, it\u2019s hard getting a feeling of urgency or forward progress. So the story kind of limps along until finishing with an anti-climatic fizzle. Oh, well. I chalk that up to Beukes being a newer author at the time of Moxy Land\u2019s writing. I suspect she\u2019s improved drastically in this area in her newer books which I\u2019m eagerly looking forward too.Pick up something by Lauren Beukes, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll regret it.Original review available on OneLazyRobotBlog.com"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Moxyland is a severely dystopian tale of a corporate apartheid state in Cape Town, South Africa, where the government punishes people through their cell phones and bio-weapons are used as crowd control.

Beukes's frighteningly persuasive, high-tech fable that follows four narrators living in a dystopian near-future.\r\n\r\nKendra, an art-school dropout, brands herself for a nanotech marketing program. Lerato, an ambitious AIDS baby, plots to defect from her corporate employers. Tendeka, a hot-headed activist, is becoming increasingly rabid. Toby, a roguish blogger, discovers that the video games he plays for cash are much more than they seem.\r\n\r\nOn a collision course that will rewire their lives, these characters crackle with bold and infectious ideas, connecting a ruthless corporate-apartheid government with video games, biotech attack dogs, slippery online identities, a township soccer school, shocking cell phones, addictive branding, and genetically modified art. Taking hedonistic trends in society to their ultimate conclusions, Lauren Beukes spins a tale of a utopia gone wrong, satirically undermining the idea of progress as society's white knight.\r\n\r\n\"Moxyland does lots of things, masterfully, that lots of sf never even guesses that it *could* be doing.\" William Gibson", "asin": "0316267910", "rank": "271235", "city": "Cape Town", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qoQ4s8RbL.jpg", "country": "RSA", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
