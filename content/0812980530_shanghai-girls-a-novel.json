This is what could have happened during that time."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Lisa See is by far my favorite author. I can never not connect with her characters. With the many themes of mother love, sister relationships, and the struggle of women I found a piece of myself in each book. Shanghi Girls not being the exception. I found my twin and myself in the characters of Pearl and May.Always fighting. Always blaming. But never abandoning the other.I cried a good amount of times and was grateful to read a story about immigrant women that had to struggle. It reminded me of my moms story of her quest to be an American citizen and the struggle of keeping with tradition.Give Lisa See a shot. She may bring you to tears but she\u2019ll give you hope as well."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Loved this book didn\u2019t want it to end"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "An enjoyable book, especially from the perspective of the lives of Chinese in California during the the period 1920 - 1960.  The characters were interesting, if somewhat predictable.  Somehow, I felt like the younger sister's character was not fully believable.  Overall a nice read for the beach or a long weekend.

Looking forward to the sequel."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "First set in the 1930\u2019s in Shanghai, China, and then in Los Angeles, this historical novel follows two Chinese sisters who are have very different values.  Told by the older sister, Pearl, the sensible one, the story examines how the two upper-middle-class \u2018beautiful girls\u2019 deal with the horrors of the Japanese invasion of China.  They struggle to escape the bombing of Shanghai.  Even the extraordinary beauty of the spoiled younger sister May doesn\u2019t help them.  Finally, using their wits alone, the two sisters manage against all odds to escape to Los Angeles, California, where their two \u2018husbands\u2019 from their abruptly arranged-marriages live.No longer members of a privileged class, the two sisters now face a life of hard labor, few luxuries, and over-whelming social prejudge.  One sister adjusts to life with her new \u201cfamily\u201d; the other continues to demand \u2014 and mostly gets \u2014 what she wants.  Tempers flair.\u201cShanghai Girls\u201d examines the definition of family, of love, of self-sacrifice, and of commitment.  It looks at the relationships between children and their parents and the relationships of siblings.  It also explores how dreams can destroy.Unfortunately, at times the plot of the novel is just too contrived.  Too many things happen at just the right time to force the plot along.  This is especially true of the ending.  Then there is the overwhelming amount of racial prejudice.  The author seems determined to fit in every racial injustice she can think of.  One area where Lisa See does excell, however, is in painting a good portrait of sibling rivalry."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Although this is a book of fiction, the story is filled with rich history. Through the voice of Pearl we learn the sacrifices and the suffering of our Chinese immigrants.
