It follows many generations of a single family, and we learn about politics, economics, prejudice, social mobility and women's issues.However, I didn't finish it, and this was (I think) due to reading it in Kindle format. I found it hard to keep track of all the characters through the generations. There was a family tree at the beginning of the book, but it was too small to read on the Kindle. Plus, I couldn't keep going back and forth to the front because of being on a Kindle. (It would have been way easier to flip to the front of a physical book.)  So I never did find out what happened to all of the very vivid characters. Boo."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Product as described.

Isabel attempts to immortalize their now-united families\u2014and, by extension, their homeland\u2014in a book. The tale that unfolds in her writing has layers upon layers, exploring the nature of love, marriage, family, and Puerto Rico itself.\r\n\r\nWeaving the intimate with the expansive on a teeming stage, Ferr\u00e9 crafts a revealing self-portrait of a man and a woman, two fiercely independent people searching for meaning and identity.
