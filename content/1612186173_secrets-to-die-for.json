Jackson thinks he\u2019s got a tight case against the meth-head dad who menaced Raina, but the evidence seems to leave his suspect in the clear\u2014and a homicidal sex offender still on the loose. What Jackson fears is that his new love affair with nurse Kera Kollmorgan may be knocking him off his game. And what he never expects is to find an ally in savvy reporter Sophie Speranza, who may have stumbled on the killer\u2019s shocking motive. But even as Jackson and Sophie team up to tighten the noose, their quarry zeroes in on his next victim\u2014ready to take his twisted game to the next level.", "asin": "1612186173", "rank": "1659464", "city": "Eugene", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41CJh7X3ePL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
