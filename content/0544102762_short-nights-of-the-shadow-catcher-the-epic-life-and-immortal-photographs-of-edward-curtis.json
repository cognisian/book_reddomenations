Well researched by someone who is very passionate about the subject matter. I would love to see Mr. Egan's view of the Shadow Catcher's experiences and work brought to life in film. What Mr. Curtis was trying to do needs to be brought out to a broader audience in a dramatic versus a documentary way . If done correctly the Mr. Egan's representation could have a significant impact on the conventional understanding of the life of the Native Communities which Mr. Curtis was trying to represent."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Timothy Egan has captured the essence of a remarkable man with an compelling narrative.  This book, which could be understood as history, biography or anthropology, reads like a novel.  Edward Curtis, as represented by Egan, was a man of integrity who insisted on letting Native Americans speak for themselves.  He did this through his relationships with his subjects, his photos and his accompanying materials (written textand primitive musical recordings.)"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It\u2019s terribly difficult after finishing the 6th in a series of Timothy Egan\u2019s books to declare a favorite. Yet,  Egan\u2019s  Short Nights of the Shadow Catcher: The Epic Life and Immortal Photographs of Edward Curtis \u2013 is -well \u2013 it broke my heart.The life and times of \u201cfanatical\u201d (self described) artists like Edward Curtis are rarely full of fulfilling, float you on air happiness.  Yet, his life had many interactions and endorsements by the day\u2019s rich and famous (Teddy Roosevelt and J. Pierpont Morgan (to name two - not that this makes any difference in terms of Curtis's immortal contributions).A man who attempted to capture the remnants of an ever encroaching genocide of the remaining inhabitants of the western tribes of Native Americans is a noble story. And noble is the way Egan tells it. Yet, it leaves you (the trajectory of Curtis\u2019s life) unfulfilled\u2026as the life stories of so many artists do.How Egan finds these tales and has the uncanny ability to weave story in and around the real-life characters he portrays \u2013 is \u2013 well \u2013 a mysterious literary talent that I\u2019m unsure if even he could describe it adequately. The book, story, prose, research and Egan\u2019s writing just make you salivate for the next page.This is an unequivocal FIVE STAR work (which I don\u2019t attribute to most literature I read). It is a treasure \u2013 just as the life of Edward Curtis and his enduring work was/is. I am really glad I read this book.

He moved in rarefied circles, a friend to presidents, vaudeville stars, leading thinkers. But when he was thirty-two years old, in 1900, he gave it all up to pursue his Great Idea: to capture on film the continent\u2019s original inhabitants before the old ways disappeared.\r\n\r\nCurtis spent the next three decades documenting the stories and rituals of more than eighty North American tribes. It took tremendous perseverance \u2014 ten years alone to persuade the Hopi to allow him to observe their Snake Dance ceremony. And the undertaking changed him profoundly, from detached observer to outraged advocate. Curtis would amass more than 40,000 photographs and 10,000 audio recordings, and he is credited with making the first narrative documentary film. In the process, the charming rogue with the grade school education created the most definitive archive of the American Indian.\r\n\r\n\u201cA vivid exploration of one man's lifelong obsession with an idea . . . Egan\u2019s spirited biography might just bring [Curtis] the recognition that eluded him in life.\u201d Washington Post \r\n\r\n\u201cA darn good yarn. Egan is a muscular storyteller and his book is a rollicking page-turner with a colorfully drawn hero.\u201d San Francisco Chronicle", "asin": "0544102762", "rank": "25694", "city": "Seattle", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51W3s1bhnaL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
