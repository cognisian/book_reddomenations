In the immediate aftermath of the First World War The leaders of the Allied nations, particularly the USA, Great Britain and France met to ostensibly put the pieces back together after the collapse of the Austria- Hungarian empire, the Ottoman Empire and Germany. The book includes a remarkable level of detailed anecdotal stories that illuminate the characters and interactions of the major personalities involved. Wilson, LLoyd George ,  Clemenceau and many others cross the stage in these pages as maps are redrawn, ethnic and tribal rivalries that had been dormant under the rule of now defeated empires are reawakened and a defeated Germany is chastised by the victors. Incredibly well researched and written this is an entertaining and fascinating book that brings to light the immense political pressures and difficulties faced by the Allies who were negotiating the fate of the world. It makes it clear that while the intentions were good as evidenced by Wilson's 14 points ( included as an appendix) , real world considerations and political jousting created the need for compromises and decisions that ultimately had tragic consequences. The author concludes that history has simplified these complex factors into essentially a formula that blames the stringent terms of the Treaty Of Versailles on what was to follow in Germany and lead to the rise of Hitler ,and makes a sound case that the reality and circumstances were much more complicated. From the Middle East to Eastern Europe to Africa and Asia the horse trading and decisions made in these fateful days , so well described in these pages, have echoed down the decades and many of those decisions shape the world we still live in almost 100 years later.Wilson's dream of a league of nations fairly constituted of nations of self -determined peoples seems naive in retrospect; a case of good intentions  colliding with reality that had innumerable and still not fully realized long term implications."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A super book telling how the world was changed after WW1."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Fabulous and complete review of effect on each country a result of Treaty"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "MacMillan concludes with some \u201cwhat ifs\u201d based on the flaw with her work.  The book is a defense of the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles.  While she ignores damning documents of the British begging Wilson to stop touring France collecting accolades and come to work, she does not alter facts.  She correctly identifies 1939 as the test of the work of 1919.  Her proof that Versailles was not the cause of the second world war is that Hitler would have wanted more land even if an absolute status quo was maintained in the prior settlement.  This statement comes just a few pages after pointing out that the Weimar Republic fell apart largely due to signing the treaty.  Even Hindenburg thought Hitler was a buffoon so it is very unlikely that Hitler would have had a successful career apart from the treaty.  The greatest flaw is that the work ignores Wilson diversion of the conference from one of a lasting peace to a League of Nations monument to himself.  The delays caused by this diversion allowed French and Italian greed to fester while the fourteen points became a lie to Germany that the peace would not look backward for a model.  Whether Germany had put together reports that the consequences of the peace would resemble what they became, Wilson had led them to believe this would not be the case.  MacMillan believes that the conference put into place many international legal norms and this justifies any other troubles.  This is a diversion.  The League of Nations was a failure, but it was worthwhile as a separate issue.  Wilson\u2019s insistence that the League be the first order of business was inept.  If the League was discussed at all it should have been a separate issue and not part of the actual treaty.  When diplomats met in Paris, their job was to formulate a treaty.  The treaty they put together made the rise of Hitler and the Second World War unavoidable.  In the closing \u201cwhat ifs\u201d, MacMillan should have included \u201cwhat if Wilson had not raised German expectations of a just peace and got down to business restraining France from its justified desire for revenge\u201d."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Outstanding history of a troubling time that screwed the world until today"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "delivery on time receive it next day . very nice . very good .
