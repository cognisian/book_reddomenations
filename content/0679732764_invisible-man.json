I find the story to be of shallow imagination, narrow, and short-sighted vision of possibilities open to a person of higher education and strong intelligence such as the protagonist of the story. His avenues of possible options were so common and lacked creativity. What could have been done with such an advantage is far greater than the author perceived and pursued in this rather disappointing story."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "good quick read!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a great book.

A first novel by an unknown writer, it remained on the bestseller list for sixteen weeks, won the National Book Award for fiction, and established Ralph Ellison as one of the key writers of the century.\r\n\r\nThe nameless narrator of the novel describes growing up in a black community in the South, attending a Negro college from which he is expelled, moving to New York and becoming the chief spokesman of the Harlem branch of \"the Brotherhood\", and retreating amid violence and confusion to the basement lair of the Invisible Man he imagines himself to be.\r\n\r\nThe book is a passionate and witty tour de force of style, strongly influenced by T.S.
