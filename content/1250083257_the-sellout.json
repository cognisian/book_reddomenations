It challenges the sacred tenets of the United States Constitution, urban life, the civil rights movement, the father-son relationship, and the holy grail of racial equality\u2015the black Chinese restaurant.\r\n\r\nBorn in the \"agrarian ghetto\" of Dickens\u2015on the southern outskirts of Los Angeles\u2015the narrator of The Sellout resigns himself to the fate of lower-middle-class Californians: \"I'd die in the same bedroom I'd grown up in, looking up at the cracks in the stucco ceiling that've been there since '68 quake.\" Raised by a single father, a controversial sociologist, he spent his childhood as the subject in racially charged psychological studies. He is led to believe that his father's pioneering work will result in a memoir that will solve his family's financial woes. But when his father is killed in a police shoot-out, he realizes there never was a memoir. All that's left is the bill for a drive-thru funeral.\r\n\r\nFueled by this deceit and the general disrepair of his hometown, the narrator sets out to right another wrong: Dickens has literally been removed from the map to save California from further embarrassment. Enlisting the help of the town's most famous resident\u2015the last surviving Little Rascal, Hominy Jenkins\u2015he initiates the most outrageous action conceivable: reinstating slavery and segregating the local high school, which lands him in the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Sellout is among the most important and difficult American novels written in the 21st century . . . It is a bruising novel that readers will likely never forget.\u201d Los Angeles Times", "asin": "1250083257", "rank": "5630", "city": "Los Angeles", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51MoVVfjSgL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
