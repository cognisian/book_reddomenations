Normally I\u2019m not a huge fan of the Mafia storylines but this was quite good and kept me guessing the entire time.  In fact, I\u2019m still not quite sure of the ending.  I guess it ends well for Montalbano but to be honest, I\u2019m not quite totally certain of that.  Anyway, is it possible this is the last of the Montalbano books?  I think I now have read them all.  It has taken me several years and if you have read my reviews you\u2019ll find that some I liked, others I did not.  I am a huge fan of the movies and they are why I read the books.  As I\u2019ve already written, the books are different and in fact Salvo (imho) is not all that likable in the books.  In fact he is kind of a jerk.  In the movies, he most definitely is not a jerk.  At any rate, the series was fun to read but maybe I am ready to move on.  But before I go, I just want to reiterate how attached I have become to all the characters in the books: Catarella, Fazio, Mimi... and all the rest.  Camilleri has concocted a family that will be impossible to forget.  And some day I would love to go to Sicily... although in my embarrassment I now can finally admit:  I don\u2019t like (nor eat) seafood.  Bueno, Salvo.
