Having read several histories on the subject, I would agree.  Published only a few years after WWII, it is a war correspondent's personal memoirs of his coverage of the entire struggle of Great Britain in Africa.  Moorehead takes us to little known conflicts in the former African colonies (Sudan, Abyssinia, etc) as well as the complete era of the North African campaigns from 1940 to 1943.  This is not so much a history but a journalist's story.  The detail is exceptional.  From Spartan life in the desert or rugged terrain of Ethiopia to the starkly oblivious social life in Cairo and Nairobi, his observations tell us what it was like.  Be forewarned, the text has not been scrubbed by modern editing to be politically correct nor adjusted to correct inaccurate historical details (battle casualties, etc) that many revised histories would have.  It is what was observed then, often with the biases of the men and leaders he lived with and reported on."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent book , covers a war as mysterious as the desert , and as extended as all the countries involved : Ethiopia, Sudan , Lybia, Egypt , Palestine, Iran, Irak ...Well written , first hand account by someone who was there."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The Desert War provides an excellent account of the Second World War in North Africa from the viewpoint of a well-connected extremely gifted journalist. It is a well written account of the war, but it offers the crucial context of an observer of events in North Africa at the time. Most historical accounts are written by academics 50 years after the event. Whilst veterans are still available, the author does not have first hand experience of the events.

The trilogy of books he wrote on the prolonged battles between Montgomery's Eighth Army and Rommel's Afrika Corps immediately drew universal acclaim, and remains and epic account as extraordinary now as it was then. \r\n\r\nThis reissue of Alan Moorehead's classic trilogy on the North Africa campaign 1940-1943 will coincide with the 75th anniversary of the Battles for El Alamein in July and October 1942.\r\n\r\nIn 1940, Alan Moorehead was sent to cover the North Africa campaign by the Daily Express, and he followed its dramatic course all the way to 1943. The three books he subsequently wrote about the Desert War \u2013 later collected as his \u2018African Trilogy\u2019 \u2013 were swiftly acclaimed as a classic account of the tussle between Montgomery\u2019s Eighth Army and Rommel\u2019s Afrika Corps, amidst the endless harsh wastes of the Western Desert. \r\n\r\nMoorehead was responsible for the celebrated insight that tank battles in the desert are like battles at sea, the lumbering tanks like ships lost in a vast ocean of sand. The New Statesman could not have put it better when it described his achievement with this riveting book: \r\n\r\n\"There is something of genius in the breadth and penetration of his vision, which encompasses the whole panorama of war and then narrows it down to the particular: the soldier stubbing out his cigarette before going into action, the expression on a tank commander\u2019s face as he is hit\u2026 The story of the African campaigns will go down in history as one of the great epics of mankind, largely thanks to Mr Moorehead\u2019s account.\"\r\n", "asin": "1781316732", "rank": "522273", "city": "Cairo", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515-sieXk8L.jpg", "country": "Egypt", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
