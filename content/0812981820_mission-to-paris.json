The emigr\u00e9 movie star Frederic Stahl is unusual, character wise, for Furst - but it combined two of my loves; the behind-the-scenes machinations of classical-era Hollywood, and the intrigue and espionage of Europe on the brink of WWII. Well done, sir."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Interesting settings, but not enough suspense.

Mission to Paris is one of my all time favorites of a number of his books I have read so far.

Hollywood film star Fredric Stahl is on his way to Paris to make a movie. The Nazis know he\u2019s coming\u2014a secret bureau within the Reich has been waging political warfare against France, and for their purposes, Fredric Stahl is a perfect agent of influence. What they don\u2019t know is that Stahl, horrified by the Nazi war on Jews and intellectuals, has become part of an informal spy service run out of the American embassy. Mission to Paris is filled with heart-stopping tension, beautifully drawn scenes of romance, and extraordinarily alive characters: foreign assassins; a glamorous Russian actress-turned-spy; and the women in Stahl\u2019s life. At the center of the novel is the city of Paris\u2014its bistros, hotels grand and anonymous, and the Parisians, living every night as though it were their last. Alan Furst brings to life both a dark time in history and the passion of the human hearts that fought to survive it.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of [Furst\u2019s] best . . .

In Furst\u2019s densely populated books, hundreds of minor characters\u2014clerks, chauffeurs, soldiers, whores\u2014all whirl around his heroes in perfect focus for a page or two, then dot by dot, face by face, they vanish, leaving a heartbreaking sense of the vast Homeric epic that was World War II and the smallness of almost every life that was caught up in it.\u201d The New York Times Book Review", "asin": "0812981820", "rank": "202859", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51bR6DLE4bL.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
