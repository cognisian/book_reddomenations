Of the three protagonists, Hollis and Tito are interesting, but I kept hoping Brown would kill Milgrim, the junkie, so I wouldn't have to read about him anymore. Flipping to his POV slowed the book significantly.In the end, the events of the book turn out to be a giant prank on the modern US intelligence apparatus orchestrated by Win Pollard (father of Cayce Pollard from the first book, though Gibson never comes out and says it)."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Intelligence and color like this are so increasingly rare.
