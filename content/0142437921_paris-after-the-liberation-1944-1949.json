The use of Diana Cooper's father's diaries (and his memoir filled out with the daughter's memories) is a major strength of this account of one of the most fascinating and troubling eras of French history. The book has wonderful variety and richly evocative accounts of many leading figures and events. A joy to read and savor."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I have several criticisms, which prevented me from rating it five stars.  There were a great number of names of famous (?) persons in all walks, art, literature, politics, military \u2013 you get the picture.  They breakdown into three categories: people you have never heard of, peoples whose name you vaguely recognize and people you know about (the largest group).  The author is British and he assumes everyone knows who he is talking about, this may be true for the English and Europeans but not so for Americans.  He should revise the book to give a one or two sentence biography the first time a name is mentioned.  The first part of the book describing French politics before the war is incomprehensible; in his defense, I spoke to a good friend from Paris and he says the French cannot figure it out either.  The last part of the book is a mad race to bring the book forward after 1949.  It is outside the scope of the book and unnecessary.  Otherwise \u2013 great, I enjoyed it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I've read most of Mr. Beavor's books, detail by detail.

Loved all the rest of Beevor's work in his other books.  This one had too much French without being interpretated.  Expected more information about Vietnam.  It did highlight how sorry the Grench are!!!  Currently reading After the Occupation: The Brutal Occupation of the Allies which really highlights the duplicity of the French!!!!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Love the detail Beevor always delivers.  This was the third of his works for me and I'm never disappointed!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A fascinating story well told: about France occupation, collaboration of Vichy, the great purges and reglements des comptes and Communist terror after the war, De Gaulle's grab to power and his later resignation, the frictions between him and the hated Anglo-Saxons, brutal and uneven justice meeted out against real or imagined collaborators, misery and hunger in post-war Paris, at the same time luxury among occupation officers and diplomats, class warfare and endless strikes, the tensions between militant Communists, the democratic centre and the Gaullists at the right, a vivid nightlife, and a great deal of intellectual creativity amongst writers, philosophers and artists, all this beautifully woven together and well told with hundreds of more or less interesting anectodes. Most focus on happenings and scandals amongst the upper classes, diplomats (including Cooper's grandfather-ambassador, whoses diaries and correspondence are extensively quoted).In the end all of this namedropping, who had what for dinner, who had an affair with whom, who was gay or not, becomes a bit tiresome. Also I find it a bit bizarre that the cover tells us that this is a funny story. Too many people did suffer, were shot or beaten to death in this book, not funny at all, rather a lot of senseless suffering"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The great historian antony beevor is having fun with this one.
