This was the most enjoyable book I've read in a while. I like the writers style - not too serious, but not insulting to ones intelligence. I've found it hard to find books that fall somewhere in between; but this book does. I don't know enough to challenge any of the facts in this book,  but it was believable enough to keep me engaged. I like reading books that give me a look into different cultures. This book did that. I would read more books by this author."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great plot and back story.

I particularly enjoyed the many issues addressed in this novel. I can't wait for the next installment."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A terrific series.  Not only are the characters, such as Darko, well done, you get a real sense of Ghana as well.  This is basically a procedural but it's not like any other you will have read, largely because of the setting.  The books can be a little slow at times but follow along and you'll understand that the pace is appropriate.  I've read them all but think this could easily be a standalone.  Try this one for a different twist."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I have to be honest - I did not read any other books in this series.  I had been told it could be a stand alone and in a lot of ways that is true.  Enough information is given about previous character relationships to be able to figure it out.  There is a lot going for this book - exotic location, interesting characters, variety of cultures.  The author does a good job at helping the reader be able to experience the environment - not just of the story but also of the characters lives."}]}, "authors": ["Kwei Quartey"], "isbn": "1616956305", "longitude": 0.0, "periods": ["2000s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "Gold of Our Fathers", "word_cloud": "give reserve page turner hard put enjoyable like writer style serious insulting one intelligence find hard fall somewhere know enough challenge fact believable enough keep engage read give look different culture plot back story culture history heartfelt hero face corruption look forward adventure very interesting background murder mystery have google information find line accurately interest move family like humor wife family have yet sure meet expectation even far decently write story dry atmosphere really come maybe idea base living different part continent good story lot twist plot really give insight well interest mystery relationship good well great mystery particularly enjoy many issue address next installment terrific series not character well do get real sense well basically procedural largely set little slow time follow along understand pace appropriate think easily different twist honest series tell alone lot way true information give previous character relationship able figure lot go exotic location interest character variety culture author good job help able experience environment story also character life", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Mystery & Suspense"], "summary": "Book 4/5 in the Darko Dawson Series\r\n\r\nDarko Dawson, Chief Inspector in the Ghana police service, returns in this atmospheric crime series often compared to Alexander McCall Smith's The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency novels.\r\n\r\nDarko Dawson has just been promoted to Chief Inspector in the Ghana Police Service\u2014the promotion even comes with a (rather modest) salary bump.

The office is a mess of uncatalogued evidence and cold case files, morale is low, and discipline among officers is lax. On only his second day on the job, the body of a Chinese mine owner is unearthed in his own gold quarry. As Dawson investigates the case, he quickly learns how dangerous it is to pursue justice in this kingdom of illegal gold mines, where the worst offenders have so much money they have no fear of the law.", "asin": "1616956305", "rank": "407316", "city": "Ghana", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51yMTutoxRL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
