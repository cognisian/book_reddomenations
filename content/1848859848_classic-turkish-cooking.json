The book was promised a week and more away, but it arrived in three days. Also, it was described as  \"Very Good Condition\", with \"signs of light shelf wear\". It arrived, in fact, in excellent condition, with nothing to differentiate it from a brand new book on a shelf at the store.Here is my wife's review:-----Please Reprint Classic Turkish CookingAlthough few Americans are acquainted with it, Turkish cuisine deserves a reputation as one of the world's finest.  As the French and the Chinese do, the Turks use seasonal ingredients to create imaginative contrasts in flavors and textures.Quite the contrast to the pretentious \"Plenty\" by Ottolenghi (which I have also reviewed) Classic Turkish Cooking offers the following practical tips to ensure good results: Table of Imperial and American Measures Table of English and American Ingredient Terms (courgette vs. zucchini, for example) Many explanatory paragraphs for ingredients commonly used in Turkish cuisine (Charcuterie, Cheese, Fruit, Herbs, Nuts, Olives, etc), listing regional origins and uses.The section on ingredients helpfully suggests how to thicken yogurt into a soft cheese, how to choose the type of oil best for the cooking process as well as to complement the other ingredients, and how to choose the best fruit and vegetables.  I heartily agree with the authors' suggestion that when cooking with tomatoes, it is better to use good canned tomatoes rather than pale out-of season tomatoes.The recipes indicate whether the dish is served for special occasions or for everyday fare, whether the preparation is easy or complicated, time-consuming or quick, and they are listed under the traditional Turkish name as well as the English translation.  The instructions are well-planned and well-explained.  The photographs are as beautiful as they are helpful.I wish I had this book thirty years ago!-----Excellent service with an excellent product!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great recipes and easy to find ingredients.
