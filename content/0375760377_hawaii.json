It pulls together the story of how Hawaii came to be - weaving tales of the native population and their trip from Bora Bora to their new home in Hawaii, the New England missionaries and ship captains who acquired the land, and built the the economy and the Chinese and then the Japanese who were brought in to work the fields. It is difficult to weave the strands of different stories into a coherent whole but it works here. I first read this book many years ago before a first trip to Hawaii. I enjoyed it just as much this time."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I think this is my third time around with this book.

Michener brings Hawaii\u2019s epic history vividly to life in a classic saga that has captivated readers since its initial publication in 1959. \r\n\r\nAs the volcanic Hawaiian Islands sprout from the ocean floor, the land remains untouched for centuries\u2014until, little more than a thousand years ago, Polynesian seafarers make the perilous journey across the Pacific, flourishing in this tropical paradise according to their ancient traditions. Then, in the early nineteenth century, American missionaries arrive, bringing with them a new creed and a new way of life. \r\n\r\nBased on exhaustive research and told in Michener\u2019s immersive prose, Hawaii is the story of disparate peoples struggling to keep their identity, live in harmony, and, ultimately, join together.\r\n\r\n\u201cWonderful . . .
