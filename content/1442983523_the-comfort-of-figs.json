Three young men work on the construction of this iconic steel bridge. Labouring high above the river in dangerous conditions, close bonds develop between them. But one slip can - and does - alter their lives forever. A generation later, Robbie, a young landscaper, grapples with his difficult relationship with his father, whose past is inextricably linked with the famous cantilevered bridge. Robbie is also battling to save his future with his girlfriend Freya, after a violent assault by a stranger sends her spiralling into herself. The Comfort of Figs is the engrossing story of the birth of a city and the burden of a family secret. Its legacy is two monuments - one of nature and one of engineering - both of them unforgettable.\r\n\r\n\"Simon Cleary's debut novel, The Comfort Of Figs, is as ambitious and meticulously constructed as the Queensland capital's Story Bridge on which it centres.
