It was always there, as Alistair Horne explains in his brilliant history of the City of Light. Horne foreshadows the revolution of 1789 by describing various events that shaped the monarchy, the aristocrats and the bourgeoisie into the entities that they were at the start of the revolution. Paris was a place mistrusted by the Kings of France from the day that Henri IV was assassinated there, leading to the establishment of Versailles, so that the king and the aristocrats became isolated from and out of touch with the City. I was a little surprised to see Horne make errors such as identifying Hortense as the sister in law of Josephine (Hortense was her daughter), but overall the book is great, written with style and focus."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A thoroughly enjoyable guided tour of the history of Paris by someone who knows the story hidden in every corner and behind every door."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great book"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Still reading it, but I love it!

Horne makes plain that while Paris may be many things, it is never boring.\r\n\r\nFrom the rise of Philippe Auguste through the reigns of Henry IV and Louis XIV (who abandoned Paris for Versailles); Napoleon\u2019s rise and fall; Baron Haussmann\u2019s rebuilding of Paris (at the cost of much of the medieval city); the Belle Epoque and the Great War that brought it to an end; the Nazi Occupation, the Liberation, and the postwar period dominated by de Gaulle--Horne brings the city\u2019s highs and lows, savagery and sophistication, and heroes and villains splendidly to life. With a keen eye for the telling anecdote and pivotal moment, he portrays an array of vivid incidents to show us how Paris endures through each age, is altered but always emerges more brilliant and beautiful than ever. The Seven Ages of Paris is a great historian\u2019s tribute to a city he loves and has spent a lifetime learning to know.", "asin": "1400034469", "rank": "74371", "city": "Paris", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519SC5SR0ML.jpg", "country": "France", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
