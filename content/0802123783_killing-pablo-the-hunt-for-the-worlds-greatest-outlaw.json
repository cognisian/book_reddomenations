In an intense, up-close account, award-winning journalist Mark Bowden exposes details never before revealed about the U.S.-led covert sixteen-month manhunt. With unprecedented access to important players\u2014including Colombian president Cisar Gaviria and the incorruptible head of the special police unit that pursued Escobar, Colonel Hugo Martinez-as well as top-secret documents and transcripts of Escobar's intercepted phone conversations, Bowden has produced a gripping narrative that is a stark portrayal of rough justice in the real world.", "asin": "0802123783", "rank": "21882", "city": "Medellin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Zd0GAzYGL.jpg", "country": "Colombia", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
