Roth's alter-ego Zuckerman returns to NYC for a medical procedure. The story includes some of Roth's pet tropes; the shadow character who \"threatens\" Zuckerman, in this case a younger writer; the woman he yearns for but can't possess. He is reunited with Amy Bellette. As Zuckerman deals with his incontinence, his angry outbursts, his inappropriate yearnings for a married woman too young to perhaps take him seriously, you come to realize you are reading the revelations of an unreliable narrator with memory loss and perhaps dementia issues. This eminently readable novel about the travails of aging engages, with moments of shock and humor, and is, of course, a must-read for those Roth fans pulled along in Zuckerman's wake."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "what can you say about Philip Roth that already hasn't been said numerous times.Great read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Have not finished yet but love all Philip Roth."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Lonoff = Henry Roth????"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Roth is always a good read.

It is also interesting but stupefying to read something that scans very easily because of his decades of accumulated skill that is nonetheless very haphazardly drawn and sketchy in some places, and maddeningly detailed in others, regardless of whether Roth seems to want to call our attention to a certain situation or character or if he is only noting something in passing. It is as though the lens keeps trying to find something on which to focus, but finds only background and some blurry objects in the fore. And, yes, the little woulda-shoulda dialogues written in theatrical form are actually something I found I kept stubbing my toes on after all that fast-paced scanning of blather already covered better and more entertainingly in other novels."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Haven't read a bad book by Roth, but this one seems to be more for his fans. Very well written and definitely has many great moments. Hard to get very involved with any of the characters though."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Roth's special gift in capturing a moment in reference to our time. His story telling technique is outstanding. His only sin is his overstating some of his positions.

Walking the streets of New York after so many years away, he quickly makes three connections that explode his carefully protected solitude. Suddenly involved, as he never wanted or intended to be again, with love, mourning, desire, and animosity, Zuckerman plays out an interior drama of vivid and poignant possibilities.\r\n\r\nRevisiting the characters from Roth's much-heralded The Ghost Writer, Exit Ghost is an astounding leap into yet another phase in this great writer's oeuvre.", "asin": "0307387291", "rank": "1194246", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KmI1yJZQL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
