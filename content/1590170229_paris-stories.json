She is writing for another time and place, and while that does not discount a book\u2019s quality (and in fact, it can be a virtue) for Gallant this scars the whole collection.  I found myself constantly searching for a perch where, as a person, I could feel the pulse of Gallant's stories.  I only found a few.Yes, Gallant can write, and write well.  And therein may be the central problem: her stories are too solidified, too set into place; they do not breathe, and this makes for suffocating reading."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Short stories some very good some just okay."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Mavis Gallant is a brilliant writer! Within every thoughtful sentence is a world of meaning and insight.  Her stories should not be read quickly; they are meant to be savored. Gallant's deep understanding and empathy for the lives of immigrants, writers, and lovers shimmers on each page.  We are uplifted and made all the better after reading her timeless work.  I think Elizabeth Strout's writing comes close in style and approach to that of Mavis Gallant."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Impressive collection of Gallant\u2019s stories.

I downloaded it in preparation for a week in Paris.  I soon discovered the stories are less \"stories\" than novellas.  Don't expect a quick read with this book.  Don't even try to breeze through it.  It's like a pot of gold and every nugget is something to be savored and cherished.  The stories are long and full of rich language and plot lines that are both interesting and unique.  So it's taken me almost a year to finish the book.  I say, so what? It was like a box of exotic Swiss chocolates that can't be eaten in one sitting...it needs to be savored, page by page (if you'll excuse the mixed metaphor.)There are a lot of pages in this book, so I would suggest getting it in a Kindle edition.  You'll save weight and it will fit snug on your lap as you read away in the Gardens of Luxemburg or in your soft feathered bed in a hotel near St. Suplice...like I did.Personally, I can't think anyone can see themselves as a traveller or serious reader or potential writer without having experienced this amazing book."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I am surprised by the rather good reviews - but I guess that is the beauty of having different tastes.The most important disappointment for me was the fact that the title of the book only means that these stories have been written during the time the writer lived in Paris. They are not about Paris. Nowhere on the cover, back or blurb does it say that. It's in the (long-ish) introduction that most of us won't read before we buy a book in a bookstore, and we obviously can't read when we buy online. Ondaatje sort of apologizes for it, saying that the writer herself eased his mind by saying that technically, they ARE Paris stories because they're written there. I say, technically, it's misleading and disappointing, especially for me, having bought this book not because of the writer but because of the subject.But, always willing to be introduced to new writing, I started reading. I have read three stories. And I will not read any more. I can say the stories are beautifully written - there aren't many writers like this. But the stories don't go anywhere. They have no beginning, no end, they're merely a description of random parts of people's lives. They are written in a way that you think there will be a climax, a secret revealed, an understanding dawning... but unless I'm particularly thick, there's nothing to understand, no hidden clue. They're very low-paced and drawn-out descriptions of uneventful lives. Well-written ones. But I couldn't help feeling a bit betrayed after each ending - like three unkept promises in a row."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Accurate description.
