Brutal. Well-written. Heart-breaking. Another in the great Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro series. The movie was good also. But the book was great."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "After reading Mystic River years ago and enjoying it, I was a little underwhelmed with Gone, Baby, Gone. Lehane obviously poses some serious moral issues and themes in this book, but the way he goes about pursuing and presenting such issues were less than stellar.For one thing, the characters were lacking and flat, in my opinion. The dialogue between the police/detectives seemed to ring artificial and forced, often in the form of them speaking in this way where they are trying to one up each other with smart aleck responses. They were also lacking in any emotional depth (I really felt zero connection to the main character, or any other ones, for that matter), and often were hard to distinguish from each other. Their interactions, dialogue, conflicts came across as a big clich\u00e9 or stereotype given their roles.Not only that, but Gone, Baby, Gone goes way over the top in various ways. The absurd amount of violence and language seemed a bit overreaching. I know the author is trying to make it \u201crealistic\u201d but he takes it too far and seems to be going for \u201cshock\u201d value points. Additionally, the plot goes in such a direction in the second half that is quite improbable and unrealistic. Couldn\u2019t really buy it.Anyhow, this was overhyped, and failed to deliver. More summer beach reading than anything else."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I am a huge fan of Dennis Lehane's Kenzie/Gennuaro novels - which have some of the best writing found anywhere. His \"A Drink Before the War\" is one of the greatest detective/crime fiction books ever written.This one fits in with the others, but whereas they all involve the darker side of society, Gone Baby Gone, at times, went too far. Parts of this were so depressing, made you wonder if we should survive. But I will keep reading the author's books; they are too good to miss."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Another in a confusingly plotted and violent series by Dennis Lehane, who I think is vastly overrated. This time, he wrote a book describing the most vile, sickening child abuse. I am done with his books."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A great read as are all Lehane's  novels!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Totally engaging. Lehane is a gifted story teller. I read the story through in one weekend. But, the story is very dark and depressing. Not exactly my style of reading/entertainment.

Amanda McCready\u2019s mom had left her alone to go next door to watch TV with her friend or so that was her story to the detectives and others later involved with the case. The child was kidnapped that night.Lieutenant Jack Doyle of Crimes Against Children (CAC) founded the unit and brought over Officers Poole and Broussard to assist the squad in their mission. Lt. Doyle was immediately brought in to investigate the missing child disappearance.Beatrice, Amanda\u2019s aunt, contacted private eyes she\u2019d seen in the media who worked to find kidnapped kids. She would do whatever it took including bankrupting the family to hire Angela Gennaro and Patrick Kenzie to find Amanda.Lieutenant Doyle tried to warn them away on their first meeting indicating that he had leverage from an unsolved murder he could dump into their laps. Then he played to their soft side to not take the case for it could end badly for the family and them.Angie and Patrick really didn\u2019t want to take the case for it brought back painful memories of an unsolved case. But, there was something about this one and the constant pleading from Beatrice that made them finally agree to the case. They informed Lieutenant Doyle of their plans and he warned them not to release info to the media and other ground rules that would keep just the CAC and them in the loop.Then things began to unwind as they uncovered Amanda\u2019s mom had stolen $200,000 from a drug dealer just before her child disappears. Strung out, Helene McCready finally owned up to stealing the money when a drug deal turned bad. Now it appeared that Amanda McCready was kidnapped because of her mom\u2019s involvement.The private eyes and Detective Broussard met with Cheese at the prison. He was the drug kingpin who supposedly got robbed. They planned to strike a deal where they would return his drug money for the little girl. Cheese would have nothing to do with it and told the PI\u2019s they weren\u2019t seeing things clearly.That didn\u2019t stop the detective and private eyes from finding someone within the organization to make the swap. It seemed while Cheese was in the tank his top man was making a run with his competition for his business. The detectives and private eyes would do anything to bring the little girl home. Their plan fell into place when they received a call to meet at the quarries to swap the $200,000 for Amanda McCready.The police force had blocked all the routes out of the quarry and the two detectives and private eyes were instructed where to go. The older detective, Poole, had an apparent heart attack climbing the treacherous path to the location. He told everyone to go on and call in the emergency once the little girl was found safe. The detectives were instructed by the kidnappers to go one way while the PI\u2019s went another up the quarry wall.The PI\u2019s found the little girl\u2019s doll floating in a deep murky water filled gorge. Angie immediately stripped and dove into the cold water to find Amanda McCready. She came up empty-handed after several dives while being rocketed by bullets from automatic weapons. The helicopter the police brought in couldn\u2019t reach her. She met Patrick and the others later at the pick-up location down the hill and found the two competing drug dealers dead in a car.  Police combed the area all night and the next day for the little girl. She wasn\u2019t found. Detective Poole was taken to the hospital where he was listed in critical condition.The private eyes, Angie and Patrick, realized they\u2019d reached a dead-end going that route. They made another attempt to rescue Amanda McCready by visiting Cheese, the drug dealer in prison. They had new ammunition since Bubba Rogowski, their friend, had gotten hit over the head while acting as their backup at the quarry. Although Cheese was a mighty big man, Bubba scared him to death whether on the inside or out. He knew he\u2019d get him and the PI\u2019s wanted to use that in their favor. It kind of worked only he wouldn\u2019t give up the name/s of the kidnappers immediately. He had something to do or someone he needed talk to first. The Cheese didn\u2019t live another 24 hours. He slipped on a wet floor and fell 40 ft. to his death. They were back to square one without a clue to Amanda McCready\u2019s location.Angie and Patrick, the private eyes questioned themselves and one another about continuing the case. They rehashed everything they knew until their old friend Bubba asked Patrick to play backup on one of his deliveries. It was a small neighborhood where everyone knows everyone - cops, PI\u2019s, drug dealers, addicts, prostitutes \u2013 you get the picture! The Dorchester boys/girls never forget the good or bad.Bubba had his reasons for asking Patrick\u2019s backup for his delivery. But, that could wait until later. He had high-powered firearms to deliver and collect the cash. On delivery, the buyer wanted the firing clips immediately that went with the guns. Bubba wouldn\u2019t let him have them until he counted his money and that took a while for he was constantly interrupted and had to begin counting again. Finally, the buyer\u2019s woman came out with her gun and this didn\u2019t stop Bubba\u2019s counting his money either. In the end, there was gunfire from the woman and others who found hidden weapons stashed in unlikely places to shoot at them. Bubba made an opening where the door once was and they got away. Bubba didn\u2019t leave them the clips for the automatic weapons he sold them.After getting safely away from the firepower, Patrick realized why Bubba had asked for him to ride along. There was something about the man that struck a memory. He had seen that face in one of the mug shots Detective Broussard had shown him of a perpetrator that did ungodly things to children. This might be a new lead in the case of finding the missing Amanda McCready and arresting her kidnappers.Patrick\u2019s hunches began to unravel unseemly things about the investigators and the case. His doubts were verified by an agent from the Justice Department who had already figured it out. He warned he and Angie about their safety now that they knew too. This realization made him take a new look at himself, his friends, cops, and his relationship with Angie. He wondered if they could stand the testing this case had placed on them.Was there any way the private eyes and detectives from the CAC could work together now to solve the mystery and bring Amanda McCready home? Was there any way this little girl could come out a winner from her unfit mother and kidnappers?\u00a0Gone, Baby, Gone: A Novel (Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro Book 4)"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I'm a fan of Lehane and probably like some of his other books better. I had not seen the movie before reading this, and would like to say the book is much better (isn't it always). There were a few twists, and I didn't expect the ending - although some of the end left me feeling unfulfilled but I guess that's part of Lehane that I love/hate. I enjoyed the main character Patrick and he felt genuine. There were slow parts but I think it was well worth getting through those for all the better parts of the book.
