She succeeded! And I am glad she did. This book is long, readable and unreadable at the same time. I read a chapter a night which was all I could take, but came back to it night after night. It is a thorough observation of the life of a family which does not know the extent of its dysfunction because it is the only family in which they have lived. The wife, in many ways the major character, reminds me of my mother, who became venemous sbout my father but would not leave. I related to the ugly duckling daughter. The father spouts many of the ideals endorsed by those of us who consider ourselves progressive, but he flits through the ideals rather than doing anything much to achieve  them. The book also shows grinding poverty, gender divide, racism, joy, horror, zest for life, and sometimes love, especially of young children for parents who by today's standards are abusive. So it is an interesting and absorbing read, both dated and contemporary, unique in this regard. If you are a serious reader who is willing to take on a tough book (not a difficult read, just tough), you will find the experience worthwhile."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of the best novels I've ever read.

In particular the sections where the father goes into some ridiculous baby talk that I found absurd, difficult to read and added nothing to the story.

I just plain didn't like it. This is not a critique of the literature. It is simply my personal reaction to the book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "An extremely well written novel, a psychological tour de force. Portrayals of childhood are exceptional.

Sam and Henny Pollit have too many children, too little money, and too much loathing for each other. As Sam uses the children's adoration to feed his own voracious ego, Henny watches in bleak despair, knowing the bitter reality that lies just below his mad visions. A chilling novel of family life, the relations between parents and children, husbands and wives, The Man Who Loved Children, is acknowledged as a contemporary classic.\r\n\r\nThe novel is set in Sydney, but was later changed to Washington D.C. to suit an American audience.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis crazy, gorgeous family novel is one of the great literary achievements of the twentieth century.
