Having born and lived all my life in this very same country and being able to relate to the background setting of the story was wonderful. She did a really good job in painting a clear picture of the scenery, history and the military men and their statuses. While I read this book, some parts of it I found myself smiling and nodding my head saying, \"this is so true.\" I hope to read more awesome/island stories from this author. Five stars!!!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Heather Rodney-Diaz has stormed the literary world with her debut Island Pursuits, which is set in Trinidad and Tobago. The Caribbean essence was captured when the author incorporated native lingo such as \"yuh cannot walk in here and do as yuh please\".Who doesn't love a man in uniform? Adrian Mendez (Afro-Latino) is a 32 year old ex-Marine now soldier who has no qualms of identifying himself as \"African-American-Hispanic-Trinidadian\". After an emotional breakup Mendez decided moving to the island would soothe his broken heart.Cory Phillips (black and Indian) is an educated, feisty, dramatic heroine who doesn't think twice about putting on a show to get her point across. Her characteristics are quickly displayed when her car is stolen from the parking lot where she was enjoying a New Year's celebration. Detesting anyone in uniform Phillip doesn't anticipate much help from the police department.No one would have ever thought Cory would have fallen for someone in uniform due to an unspoken situation. Her emotions are in disarray when it's clear that her relationship with Adrian has caused her to lose a best friend and much more. When she discovers Adrian withheld a dreadful secret, she's immediately taken back to a point in her life she wished never existed. Although Adrian omitted the truth, I applauded his efforts as he mended each obstacle for inner peace.It took a few chapters for me to really get into the story line but overall Island Pursuits turned out to be a nice read. There are several grammatical errors but nothing that hindered me from finishing the novel. The drama between Cory and her friend Kerry was never expanded on which was disappointing. Hopefully the author will enlighten us about the situation in her next release.-Reviewed by LaMona"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I really liked the island references in this story - Queens Park Savannah, Carnival, soca and a whole lotta love made this story hold my interest. The substory that gave this story tension gave it a twist that for me, made it more interesting than your average romance. Good job Heather Rodney-Diaz!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This was my First book by Heather Rodney Diaz .. Also her Debut Novel.
