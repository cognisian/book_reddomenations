There are some memorable images of highly unconventional hockey games, and times when the idiosyncratic language surprised and delighted me.  The main character and narrator, whose soul, so to speak, is placed at the center of this novel, is too familiar, and Quarrington's plot moves along like a bulldozer on a one lane road--long before I abandoned the book, I was sick of staring at it's slowly moving parts.Much better is Quarrington's novel Whale Music, which seems to be his second attempt at the same story.  The persistence paid off."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I am pathetically easy to please when it comes to books. I love pretty much every genre made available. I can settle down for a mystery. I adore a good dose of romance. I especially love books in the sci-fi and fantasy genre. More than all of this I adore hockey books. I am a huge hockey fan (supporting my Pittsburgh Penguins and Saskatoon Blades) and have over two dozen hockey books in my library.I picked up \"King Leary\" on a whim a while ago. It looked interested and it was on the Canada Great Read's list.Despite being easy to please, I was terribly disappointed. This is the first time I have read a hockey book that I have been disappointed by. Towards the end I was terribly confused and found the book jumping from past to present too quickly to follow. There are some very hilarious and chuckle-worthy parts of the book, but in all I think it truly disappointed me.I terribly hate to write about a book that has disappointed me, as I feel so \"gah\" afterwards, but there we have it.If you are a hockey or a sports fan, I recommend \"Tropics of Hockey\" by Dave Bidini. \"Searching for Bobby Orr\" by Stephen Brunt. \"Thunder & Lightning\" by Phil Esposito. These three are a far better example of wonderful hockey stories, in and away from the NHL."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Elderly former hockey star Percival Leary, born in one-nine-zero-zero, is contacted at his residence, the South Grouse Nursing Home, one day by a representative of \"Canada's best-selling ginger ale beverage\" and asked to travel to Toronto to do a commercial for the product. He agrees, taking a nurse and his roommate, Blue Hermann, former newspaper reporter who wrote about Leary (also known by his Indian nickname, Loofweeda). Leary spends a lot of time reminiscing about the antics of his youth, time spent in a reformatory, friend and fellow hockey player Manfred Armstrong Ozikean, glory days as King of the Ice, career ending injury, and two adult sons. The telling involves a lot of bragging, crazy words and humor, and a bit of sadness. The trip itself involves lots of surprises. And although I am not a fan of the sport (and could have done without the two-page dream sequence of Chapter 35), I really enjoyed this unusual, quirky-character-filled, overwhelmingly funny book chosen as the Canada Reads 2008 selection. Also good: Seabiscuit by Laura Hillenbrand and The Perfect Mile by Neal Bascomb."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "[...] -- Congratulations to our friend and colleague Paul Quarrington, and kudos to champion Dave Bidini, in today's KING LEARY'S win on CANADA READS!
