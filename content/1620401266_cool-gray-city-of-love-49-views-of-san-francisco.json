I grew up in the 40's when it was fabulously not crowded, rents were affordable and basically no crime. Thirty years ago I moved to a small island in Washington State which I love and for years I would dream of being in San Francisco and exploring my old neighborhoods. Now it has changed so dramatically I can't imagine living there. Gary Kamiya has written a great book and I learned so much about the early days. I have sent copies of the book to other natives and they also loved it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very eclectic and fun read.

Since I began Cool Gray City of Love I've been sharing vignettes and raving about it to countless friends.  Gary has created a literary mix tape of San Francisco history- melding geology and prehistoric times seamlessly with the lives of the stalwart first residents of the land and his own colorful history.  He traverses the history of the Tenderloin as easily as the formation of the Farallon Islands.  He is unflinching in covering the hardships of the early gold miners and the African American workers who flocked to the area for shipbuilding during WWII.  I now see the incredibly rich history behind neighborhoods and even specific buildings as I walk through the city. This breadth of this book is an incredible gift to anyone who lives in the area or is curious about how this beautiful hotbed of innovation came to be."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "great book. a must read for anyone interested in the history of san francisco from the view of all of its nooks and crannies."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is the mother of Travel Books.
