He is a perfect writer for describing the 'colony' of Big Sur in its early stages.  Primarily enjoyable because of the context Miller gives the experience.  Bravo!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Miller doesn't rush anything in \"Big Sur...\" and in the end, I appreciated this quality of the book.  Made me think generally, made me reflect personally, and made me reconsider how I was living and could be living.  Miller is good for that."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Had never read Henry Miller before but Big Sur is one of my favorite places in the world so when I found out it was one of his favorite places in the world, too and that he lived there for 15 years, I decided to give the book a try.  It is absolutely outstanding!  I found myself highlighting, underlining, making notations in the margin and even journaling about many sections.  It is truly tremendous and I continue to re-read it, again and again.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea or even for most people but it is one of my all-time favorite books."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Good transaction.
