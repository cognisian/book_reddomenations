Its geology, its unique flora and fauna, and its striking role in human history intersect in surprising and dynamic ways. \r\n\r\nThis book is the most wide-ranging and beautifully illustrated book available on the famous islands. Not since Darwin\u2019s Naturalist\u2019s Voyage has a book combined so much scientific and historic information with firsthand accounts that bring the Gal\u00e1pagos to life.\r\n\r\nGal\u00e1pagos: The Islands That Changed the World describes how tragedy and murderous pirates curtailed settlement of the islands and how the islands\u2019 pristine nature, spectacular geology, and defining isolation inspired Darwin\u2019s ideas about evolution. \r\n\r\nThe book explores the diverse land and marine habitats that shelter Gal\u00e1pagos species and considers the islands\u2019 importance today as a frontier for science and a refuge for true wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe book\u2019s extensive gazetteer provides details about endemic plants and animals as well as travel advice about visitors\u2019 sites, diving, photography, when to go, and what to take. Vividly illustrated throughout, this guide is an indispensable reference for natural history enthusiasts, armchair travelers, and island visitors alike.", "asin": "0300122306", "rank": "104532", "city": "Gal\u00e1pagos Islands", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51LhZn0pFrL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
