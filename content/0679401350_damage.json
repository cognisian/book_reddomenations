This isn't a pretty book.  It's desperate and sad and makes statement after statement of uncommon truth.  It's hard to categorize this short little novel,  maybe it's an allegory?  Maybe it's a cross eyed peek at human passion.  Passion is from the Greek word for suffering.  It will plunge a knife into your chest and turn it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "In retesting story. Can't decide what I like most, the movie or the book.

However, the subject matter was extraordinarily dark and very depressing.  It is the tale of a man who seemingly has everything.  A beautiful wife and two perfect children. A life of wealth and comfort.  A long standing career as a physician, and then a successful turn as an elected official.  Despite all of this, this man feels empty and not quite alive.  That all changes when by chance he encounters his son's new love interest.  This is a tale of desperation, fateful choices made.  A tale of loss and despair, albeit beautifully crafted."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I needed to read another story of a white dude's mid-life crisis like I needed a hole in the head, but I actually really liked this book. It's beautifully written and the characters are really well developed - even those on the periphery of the story, which is rare. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick, easy read but still wanting powerful prose and storytelling rather than romantic fluff."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Honestly if I had not seen the movie years ago and wondered why it isn't aired like many other older movies; I probably would not have purchased DAMAGE.  But I am so glad that I have now read the book that filled in some needling questions left by the movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  Now if someone would just air the movie again, all will be well."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "What a fantastic book. Brilliantly written. What an epic love story. I highly recommend this novel.
