He is also a neurologist. He is beset from multiple directions. One pressure cooker experience is that his soon to be ex places high demands from him in their divorce. The book is set in the ultra expensive San Francisco so just housing costs alone are a crippling \"extra\" to take on for two.Then there is his job. He evaluates a lot of very strange and messy cases. As if that isn't trying enough, in walks a beautiful woman married to a homicide detective as a patient. He becomes obsessed with her.Then he meets a multi skilled veteran who helps him make extra money on the side with some dubious ventures into antique furniture. The moral compass dips with this venture. But the veteran has a lot of other life skills which Chance lacks.There are many interesting and creative twists and turns.This was also made into a quite good tv adaptation in 2016, called Chance and starring Hugh Laurie. It was quite good too."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I purchased this novel after watching the Netflix series hoping that the book would expand on the story, bring more life to the characters and add something to a great, well written story.  Unfortunately it appears that script writers for Netflix copied the novel, almost word for word.  The Novel had nothing extra to add, which is a rarity when to comes to novels turned to movies/series.  Overall a great story, but if your expecting more than what Netflix has provided, you will be disappointed."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Dark,twisty thriller with literary style."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I had high hopes for this book described as \"Raymond Chandler-esque\" -- PUH-leeze!  Not remotely in the same league as Chandler.  Story packed with fillers that really were superfluous; writing style was juvenile.

I like a psychological thriller, and this novel kept me on the edge of my seat.  The plot of this book was well developed.  There were times that as the reader you could predict what might happen, and you were right; but just as many occurrences where you were caught by total surprise.  I enjoy a healthy amount of both because there is enough surprise to keep you engaged, but enough predictability to keep you from getting confused."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "intricate plot, graphic violence good story"}]}, "authors": ["Kem Nunn"], "isbn": "0743289293", "longitude": -122.4192363, "periods": ["2000s", "Recent Releases"], "title": "Chance: A Novel", "word_cloud": "hat rule write style choppy easy find read thing multiple time always nor psychiatrist main character chance also neurologist beset multiple direction pressure cooker experience soon ex place high demand divorce set ultra expensive housing cost alone cripple extra job evaluate lot strange messy case try enough walk beautiful woman marry homicide detective patient become obsessed meet multi skilled veteran help make extra money side dubious venture antique furniture moral compass dip venture veteran lot life skill many interest creative twist also make quite good tv adaptation call star quite good purchase watch series hop story bring life character add something great well write story unfortunately appear script writer copy almost word word nothing extra add rarity come novel turn overall great story expect provide disappointed twisty thriller literary style high hope describe not remotely league pack filler really superfluous write style juvenile keep read see end main story even disappointing spoiler start doctor chance waste life evaluate brain damage write report typically lawyer pay prefer undertakes rescue beautiful woman abusive husband get support guidance old friend include secretary nurse hospital new friend big something giant samurai big antique dealer carl end chance take charge life charisma value example defies lawyer hire declare old doc incompetent manage money declare old guy contemporary existential go alienate engaged find mean value act thriller romance admit skeptical first say strait start bang easiest get follow chance point view closely felt first distance intellectualization doubt hung because previous novel great indeed ambiance wake right along chance last page become doctor hero lively engage nun nail end waste time tv series disappointing double violence take away chance humanity make creepy make woman creepy love like psychological thriller keep edge seat plot well develop time right many occurrence catch total surprise enjoy healthy amount enough surprise engage enough predictability get confused intricate plot graphic violence good story", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Mystery & Suspense"], "summary": "From Los Angeles Times Book Prize winner Kem Nunn and \u201cprincipal heir to the tradition of Raymond Chandler and Nathanael West\u201d (The Washington Post)\u2014an intense psychological suspense novel about a San Francisco neuropsychiatrist who becomes sexually involved with a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder, whose pathological ex-husband is an Oakland homicide detective.\r\n\r\nA dark tale involving psychiatric mystery, sexual obsession, fractured identities, and terrifyingly realistic violence\u2014Chance is set amid the back streets of California\u2019s Bay Area, far from the cleansing breezes of the ocean.
