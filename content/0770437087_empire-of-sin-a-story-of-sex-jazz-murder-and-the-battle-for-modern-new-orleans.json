There are components of this book that flabbergasted and some that were horrible.  How reformists separated the peoples of New Orleans was absurd and there are still those elitists around today.

Clearly, I'm interested in the people and history of New Orleans, but I was truly blown away but the Krist masterpiece. Not only did I my knowledge of and love for New Orleans grow, but it was a pleasure to read such a beautifully written piece of work. It was also exciting, as a former English and current History teacher, to find myself learning new vocabulary. I truly enjoy Krist's use of language. I highly recommend this book. Now I'm even more excited for my annual trip to the Crescent City ... the city where my husband and I were married in Pirates Alley ... the City that has had its hooks in us ever since."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Fantastic Read.

The author is a tremendous story-teller. A reader who does not know much about the \"marrow\" of New Orleans, its history, its people, its complex cultural origins, should definitely read this book. It's a page turner.
