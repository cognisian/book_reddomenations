Raised in the ghost town of Silver Wells, Nevada, Maria Wyeth is an ex-model and the star of two films directed by her estranged husband, Carter Lang. But in the spiritual desert of 1960s Los Angeles, Maria has lost the plot of her own life. Her daughter, Kate, was born with an \u201caberrant chemical in her brain.\u201d Her long-troubled marriage has slipped beyond repair, and her disastrous love affairs and strained friendships provide little comfort. Her only escape is to get in her car and drive the freeway\u2014in the fast lane with the radio turned up high\u2014until it runs out \u201csomewhere no place at all where the flawless burning concrete just stopped.\u201d But every ride to nowhere, every sleepless night numbed by pills and booze and sex, makes it harder for Maria to find the meaning in another day.My Thoughts: Joining the journey of Maria Wyeth in\u00a0Play It as It Lays: A Novel\u00a0felt like a descent. A slow unraveling of a woman who has found no meaning in her life, and who will end up with nothing left.Mariah has finally come full circle and is under the care of psychiatrists, in a place where she can turn her life over to others.In a non-linear narrative, we watch Mariah\u2019s life in flashbacks. Anything she sees in the world around her can send her back to moments in another time or place. Some happy moments, and as she grasps for feelings of connection, she can hang on a little longer. Images of her daughter Kate feel the most poignant, and sometimes she seems to be grasping for time with her again, but she also realizes that these hopes are impossible.Watching a young woman destroy herself slowly, and seeing those around her enable her, felt like an insidious train wreck. Self-destruction takes time, but when it finally happens, you almost feel relieved. A beautifully written story that literally depressed me. 4.5 stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "In Joan Didion's classic, Play It as It Lays, Maria Wyeth resides in a psychiatric hospital. As the story unfolds we get a glimpse of what her life was like before she got there. Set in Hollywood, Las Vegas, and the Mojave Desert, there isn't any glitz. It's bleak, harrowing, and fascinating."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "This review is not based on the contents of the books, as I adore Joan Didion as an author. Rather, the fact that the item displayed in the listing of this item is not what I received. I have been searching for the printing of this book with the \"right\" cover, the one pictured with the snake and sun. I was glad to have finally found it but was skeptical as to whether or not it would actually be this cover. Let me tell you that it was NOT. The book I received was the printing with the cover which I was trying to avoid and do not desire. The pictured cover is much more pleasing in my opinion and that's what I wanted when I bought the book. Please change the listing photo to ACCURATELY depict what customers will receive in the mail. This may sound strange, but the cover of books is important to me and I am disappointed to find that what I saw was not what I got."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "An author that makes the Best Lists does a book for the Best Lists.
