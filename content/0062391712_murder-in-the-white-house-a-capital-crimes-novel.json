To be fair the first chapter (54 pages) were very, very slow. I was very, very concerned. However, once the book got started (Chapter 2) it was wonderful. Admittedly I'm a policy work who lives DC and politics, but I loved this book. The policy details, the history, and, yes, the mystery. The mystery itself was well thought out, as was the characters and the plotting. I honestly don't think anyone but a former White House residence and insider could have written this with the realism that Ms Truman did, and I doubt anyone else could have gotten away with the plot.A great book that you I couldn't put down (after I got 50 pages in.)"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I'm a BIG fan of Margaret Truman's style of writing!!

Built suspense with a slight surprise ending (I had guessed some of it, but not all.) Having already read many of this series, I can see a slight difference from the later ones - there isn't as much in-depth, behind the scenes look at life in the book's location (in this book, the White House). After reading most of the other Capital Crimes books, I came away with an informative picture of life in the National Gallery of Art, the House, the Kennedy Center, the Smithsonian, etc. This story mostly centered around the characters with not much atmosphere. It did become a page turner all the way to the end. The series gets better and better."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Margaret Truman's entry into the world of mystery writing is a stellar addition to the genre. As an insider, she knows the workings of the White House and the political maneuvering that takes place in an administration. It is very cleverly plotted and wrongdoer is a true surprise that literally left me breathless. I look forward to reading the other books in the series and highly recommend Murder in the White House."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Good readable yarn"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "liked the story, but was not my favorite M.

Margaret Truman\u2019s first book in the Capital Crimes series, Murder in the White House, takes readers on a whirlwind journey through the public halls of power and the private corridors of the White House. When the Secretary of State is found murdered in the Lincoln bedroom, Ron Fairbanks, special counsel to the president and secret suitor of presidential daughter Lynne, is appointed to head the investigation.\r\n\r\nThe investigation leads Fairbanks headlong into the secrets of not only the Secretary of State, but the President, the First Lady, and his beloved Lynne. When the young attorney realizes the position he\u2019s in, torn between his job, his loyalty, his love, and uncovering the truth, he must make gut-wrenching choices, which lead to a surprise that no one could have foreseen.\r\n\r\nMargaret Truman used her first-hand Washington political knowledge to create Capital Crimes, a riveting twenty-five book series of political mysteries set in and around the landmarks of the capital city; from Foggy Bottom to Embassy Row to the Smithsonian. There are some recurring characters, but the series can be read out of sequence. Capital Crimes is Truman\u2019s most popular series, with several titles spending time on the New York Times Bestsellers List.\r\n\r\nReleased in 1980, this novel quickly became a bestseller, as well as a Book-of-the-Month Club alternate selection. The book also forms the basis for the 1997 movie Murder at 1600 starring Wesley Snipes, Diane Lane, and Alan Alda.", "asin": "0062391712", "rank": "76756", "city": "Washington D.C.", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51yarDbvLyL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
