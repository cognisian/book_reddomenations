Black is the right person for this job, having a nearly perfect memory for a past that includes important work as an activist, educator and scholar.  He knows what his subjects are getting at and knows how to tweek the most out of them.  Timuel Black's memories intertwine with the memories of his subjects and create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.

What they found was much less than what they'd hoped for, but it was much better than what they'd come from--and in the process they set in motion vast changes not only in Chicago but also in the whole fabric of American society. This book, the first of three volumes, revisits this momentous chapter in American history with those who lived it. \r\n\r\nOral history of the first order, Bridges of Memory lets us hear the voices of those who left social, political, and economic oppression for political freedom and opportunity such as they'd never known--and for new forms of prejudice and segregation. These children and grandchildren of ex-slaves found work in the stockyards and steel mills of Chicago, settled and started small businesses in the \"Black Belt\" on the South Side, and brought forth the jazz, blues, and gospel music that the city is now known for. \r\n\r\nHistorian Timuel D. Black, Jr., himself the son of first-generation migrants to Chicago, interviews a wide cross-section of African Americans whose remarks and reflections touch on issues ranging from fascism to Jim Crow segregation to the origin of the blues. Their recollections comprise a vivid record of a neighborhood, a city, a society, and a people undergoing dramatic and unprecedented changes.", "asin": "0810122952", "rank": "2510110", "city": "Chicago", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51OhOBb0jEL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
