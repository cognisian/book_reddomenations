Writing with assurance and control, James uses his small-town drama to suggest the larger anguish of a postcolonial society struggling for its own identity.\" \r\n--New York Times Book Review (Editors' Choice)\r\n\r\nThis stunning debut novel tells the story of a biblical struggle in a remote Jamaican village in 1957 with language as taut as classic works by Cormac McCarthy and a richness reminiscent of early Toni Morrison.\r\n\r\nMarlon James was born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1970. His second novel, The Book of Night Women, a New York Times Editors\u2019 Choice, was released in 2009 to widespread critical acclaim.
