I\u2019ve taken the underground or tube more times than I can count. I\u2019ve ridden buses down Charing Cross and up to Hampstead Heath. My knowledge of what was underneath my feet was, like most visitors and even many residents of London, was limited to the tube. Little did I know that I was walking over more than 2,000 years of buried history, secret tunnels, abandoned air raid shelters, closed tube stations, channeled rivers (several of them), old wells, and both formal and informal sewer systems.Peter Ackroyd, writer, biographer, and cultural historian, has set me straight in \u201dLondon Under.\u201d It\u2019s a fascinating, readable account of what lies under the streets, sidewalks, and buildings of one of the world\u2019s great cities. It\u2019s also made me aware of the outlines of abandoned tube stations, unobtrusive doors that lead downward, and the possible implications of what we mean when we say \u201cunderground.\u201dAnd what\u2019s under London has shaped what\u2019s on the surface. Streets often follow paved-over and channeled rivers (which explains a lot of strange twists and turns in the City of London, that square mile that is the city\u2019s origin and financial district). Bus rides to and from Hampstead Heath on the surface are simultaneously boat rides down various rivers.London\u2019s history generally goes down about 26 feet. Ackroyd notes that one perhaps one of the few benefits of the German air blitz of London in 1940 and 1941 was the uncovering of a considerable portion of the city\u2019s Roman history. All Hallows by-the-Tower Church was hit by a bomb and fire bombs, and the floor of a Roman residence was discovered. (Much later, excavations under the Guildhall uncovered the site of a Roman amphitheater.) Above the Roman layer is the Anglo-Saxon layer, topped by the medieval, Tudor and more modern layers.Ackroyd looks at how London has channeled and enclosed its rivers; how underground London came to be associated with the criminal underworld; the history of London\u2019s sewers (at one time synonymous with its rivers and streets); the construction of the underground rail system; the tunnels built for various reasons (including a tunnel which stretches from Trafalgar Square down Whitehall almost all the way to Parliament); and the use of the tube system and its stations during both world wars as air raid shelters.For all of the iconic scenes in World War II movies showing people taking shelter in tube stations during the blitz, what Ackroyd points out was that it was a practice forced on the government by the citizens. At first, the Ministry of Transport forbade people using the stations as shelters, which the people obligingly ignored.\u201cLondon Under\u201d is filled with unknown facts and well-researched insights, but it is more than a collection of trivia. Ackroyd is too good a writer simply to publish a trivia collection. Instead, he plumbs the terrain that is beneath London\u2019s streets and buildings with a practiced and experienced eye, and sees through the darkness this great city is built upon."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "What an interesting book! Who knew there were rivers flowing alongsideancient Roman wells and walls deep underneath the city of London? Oldsubway tubes, closed off in dust were brought back to life as places ofprotection during both world wars. All of London underground, up toNinety feet in some places, is inter-leaved by ancient and evensomewhat recent caverns and tunnels. This book explains the answers toWhy? Where? and When?

The depth below is hot, much warmer than the surface and this book tunnels down through the geological layers, meeting the creatures that dwell in darkness, real and fictional -- rats and eels, monsters and ghosts. \r\n\r\nThere is a bronze-age trackway under the Isle of Dogs, Wren found Anglo-Saxon graves under St Paul's, and the monastery of Whitefriars lies beneath Fleet Street. In Kensal Green cemetery there was a hydraulic device to lower bodies into the catacombs below -- \"Welcome to the lower depths\". A door in the plinth of statue of Boadicea on Westminster Bridge leads to a huge tunnel, packed with cables -- gas, water, telephone. When the Metropolitan Line was opened in 1864 the guards asked for permission to grow beards to protect themselves against the sulphurous fumes, and called their engines by the names of tyrants -- Czar, Kaiser, Mogul -- and even Pluto, god of the underworld.\r\n\r\nGoing under London is to penetrate history, to enter a hidden world. \"The vastness of the space, a second earth,\" writes Peter Ackroyd, \"elicits sensations of wonder and of terror. It partakes of myth and dream in equal measure.\"", "asin": "0307473783", "rank": "354706", "city": "London", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61nw7F1M9LL.jpg", "country": "England", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
