Reilly.Instead of a New Orleans fantasist and a host of other bizarre characters, Theft is about a painter in Sydney, with a brother who is as grotesque as Ignatius J. Reilly, and his attempts to persuade the world to recognize him for the genius he thinks he is.It is not nearly as good as A Confederacy of Dunces but is very funny especially when the reader receives the conflicting views of the same situation by the two brothers.However, the plot is a bit weak and the sheer pace eventually tired me out. If you have more stamina then you might enjoy it."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I found it a bit confusing on first read.  might try it again just to get the flow better and not concentrate on which brother was speaking so much.

Alone together they\u2019ve forged a delicate and shifting equilibrium, a balance instantly destroyed when a mysterious young woman named Marlene walks out of a rainstorm and into their lives on three-inch Manolo Blahnik heels. Beautiful, smart, and ambitious, she\u2019s also the daughter-in-law of the late great painter Jacques Liebovitz, one of Butcher\u2019s earliest influences. She\u2019s sweet to Hugh and falls in love with Butcher, and they reciprocate in kind. And she sets in motion a chain of events that could be the making\u2014or the ruin\u2014of them all.\r\n\r\nTold through the alternating points of view of the brothers\u2014Butcher\u2019s urbane, intelligent, caustic observations contrasting with Hugh\u2019s bizarre, frequently poetic, utterly unique voice\u2014Theft reminds us once again of Peter Carey\u2019s remarkable gift for creating indelible, fascinating characters and a narrative as gripping as it is deliriously surprising.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn addition to historical, behavioral, and playful storytelling dimensions, there is an emphatically physical dimension of conflict to [Carey\u2019s] work, conveyed not through words but in between them. The air in his novels can feel charged and changeable, thinning to ghostliness or thickening to sluggishness, as before a storm. Carey\u2019s latest novel operates on all these levels, and a couple of new ones . . . . [Hugh\u2019s] voice is studded with funny malapropisms, Joyce-inflected scat, and a low-grade hysteria that Carey humorously conveys . . . The most skillful effect in Theft is Carey\u2019s complex weaving of [the brothers\u2019] harsh emotional legacy into the grown men\u2019s thoughts, behavior, and spasmodic jokes . . . On the surface Carey\u2019s [prose] pulls us forward in an atmosphere of antic noir. But the book turns out to be nearly as dense with themes, subplots, and embedded details as a more capacious and ambitious work like Oscar and Lucinda . . .
