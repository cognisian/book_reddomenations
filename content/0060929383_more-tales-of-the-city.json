I read them when they first came out, and am now re-reading them, more for nostalgic reasons.  Maupin knows how to write characters, and he gives them each their own voice:  from the young, green Maryann Singleton from Ohio, to the fabulous over 50 year old Anna Madrigal.  The stories bring you to a time before the AIDS epidemic, but also before marriage equality, where many homosexuals were still hiding who they were ~ although not as much in San Francisco!  I would recommend these books to anyone who loves a good, quick read, but a book with substance and a good story."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "As Entertaining as it was 20 years ago when I first read the book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "absolutely fantastic.
