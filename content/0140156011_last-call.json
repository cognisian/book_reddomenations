The theatrical setting is well defined and several of the characters - Willem (Uli) himself and Berta his sister for instance - are well-drawn.But Harry Mulisch is indeed someone who sometimes needs to hide his high intelligence and he fails to do so in this book. By turns bewildering and banal, the reader is left wondering what exactly is the point which Mulisch is getting at. The skill with which Mulisch executes the five \"acts\" has little corrolary in content: it's as if it is all form and little substance. Above all, Mulisch fails to make us really care about Uli; the focus shifts to Berta who is revealed as a more sympathetic and interesting figure.Dixon's appalling translation does Mulisch no favours: some of her howlers must be incomprehensible to non-Dutch speakers (\"everyone was hanging on her lips\" springs to mind) and her intrusively nit-picking punctuation gives the prose a stop-start feel that makes reading clunky and awkward.This is a book for Mulisch afficionados only."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Mulisch accomplished here again a dazzling novel. It is theatre withing theatre. In intricate winding of lives, the old actor, Uli Bouwmeester performs his last role of the last role of the older actor de Vries in  Shakespeares Tempest, Prospero.As magically as Prospero, the author weaves  places, situations, characters, times, events in moving, twirling, engaging  tapestry. In reference to Poe's \"Narratives ..of Pym\" the ending  takes the reader through the life transforming and time transcending  narratives of the protagonist. The novel unfolds with the clarity of greek  tragedy. But even more than these (after all 3000 years of development) it  provides rare glimpses of insight into the deeper issues of life."}]}, "authors": ["Harry Mulisch"], "isbn": "0140156011", "longitude": 4.8936041, "periods": ["1900s"], "title": "Last Call", "word_cloud": "interesting old age theater light somewhat reveal flaw somewhat unappealing central character theatrical setting well define several character sister instance indeed someone sometimes need hide high intelligence fails turn bewilder banal left wonder exactly point get skill execute act little corollary content form little substance fails make really shift reveal sympathetic interesting appal translation favor howler speaker everyone hang lip spring mind intrusively punctuation give prose feel make read clunky aficionado accomplish dazzle theater withing theater intricate winding live old actor performs role role older actor magically author weave place situation character time event move twirl engage tapestry reference end take life transform time transcend narrative protagonist unfolds clarity greek tragedy even year development provide rare glimpse insight deeper issue life", "genres": ["Fiction & Literature", "Mystery & Suspense"], "summary": "\"This is the highest kind of achievement of which fiction is capable. . . .
