It is superb, especially for the masterful way it depicts (and enables us to feel, to smell, to experience to the marrow of our bones) the horrific events surrounding the French Revolution. But read it, also, for the tender story of love, constancy, and sacrifice - the best of human actions - that bloom and develop alongside and in contrast to the anguish, terror, and ghoulish and vengeful horror brought about by the very antithesis of human goodness.This is a masterpiece and a must-read."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Not an interesting story to me."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A good unbiased overview of the conflict .

The novel was published in 1861 by the author Charles Dickens who is know for the novel \"The Tale of Two Cities\" this author has a style of repetition in his storytelling sense. The genre of this story is a Novel. The story takes place in 19th century England, a boy named Pip finds himself conflicted when he runs into a convict who threatens him into bringing food an a file, but never reveals who helped him escape his irons when he is caught. Later Pip  is sent to meet Miss. Havisham and Estella who live at Satis house, Pip instantly falls in love with the beautiful Estella, but she is cold hearted and cruel.
