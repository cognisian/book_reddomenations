The film is way better and so much more than a mere summary of the book .. I consider the book to be a very raw material for the film."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is the typical case of the book being better than the movie...and the movie was GOOD! I love a story with history and this book is just that. We are taken from Rocket's childhood and into young adulthood with a rich plot that is so riveting and unexpected you can hardly put the book down to do anything else in real life! Even if you've seen the movie, if you love to read, cop the book and see how much the movie leaves out that would have been awesome to see incorporated onto the screen.The action is intense and the emotion has depth that reaches far beyond the pages. It grips you even more when you truly realize that this book was someone's real-life experience. We take so much for granted...even our lives, and the underlying factor of this story is that the reason so many people experience a life like Rocket and his peers is because of the extent of the poverty they exist in. And overall excellent read and i reccomend it for anyone who loves a good story consisting of a mix of genres within it!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Book was great.

I think the translation into English may have taken away from the experience. I found myself relating much of the story to HBOs The Wire, how these gangsters live by this surprisingly structured moral code amidst the chaos.Honestly, rent the movie and enjoy."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Various stories are simultaneously being told by the author at once. This makes it a little difficult to follow, but also keeps you turning the pages (at least for a while). It was also suuuper graphic about sexual and violent things. In the end, it was too much for me, and I put it down. I did watch the movie in a university class, which was also very difficult for me to handle, and I had to turn away at times. I'm glad that the author is trying to show what happens in the favelas, and how bad things happen that change good people, but it made me sick to my stomach and broke my heart to see. Call me sensitive (or worse), but I really believe that we are all children of God -a human family- and we're not exactly taking care of each other very well. That's what broke my heart."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Why did the author call this area \"City of God\" - I dont get it? I saw the movie and I dont believe it explains it there either.

Cidade de Deus: a place where the streets are awash with narcotics, where violence can erupt at any moment over drugs, money, and love\u2014but also a place where the samba beat rocks till dawn, where the women are the most beautiful on earth, and where one young man wants to escape his background and become a photographer. \r\n\r\nWhen City of God erupted on screens worldwide, it became one of the most critically and commercially successful foreign films of recent years. But few were aware of the story behind the film. Written by Paulo Lins, who grew up in the favela (shantytown) Cidade de Deus in Rio e Janeiro and who spent years researching its gang history, City of God began life as a coruscating, harrowing novelistic account of twenty years in the illicit pursuits of the youth gangs born from the favela. \r\n\r\nCity of God is a raw, powerful portrait of the countless millions of poor people all over the world.", "asin": "0802170102", "rank": "860687", "city": "Rio de Janeiro", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51lXMg8oRVL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
