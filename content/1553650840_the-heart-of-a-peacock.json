The stories are arranged in themes such as her experiences with Native people, her adventures with various beloved creatures (particularly birds), her love of nature, and a whole section of stories about her mischievous pet monkey Woo. Together, they underline Emily Carr\u2019s place as a writer with the sharp yet tender eye of an artist, with a deep feeling for the tragedies of life and with a rich sense of the comic. The Heart of a Peacock has been in print ever since its publication in 1953, and, like her other books, has been read and loved by a couple of generations. The book is enhanced by seven of Carr\u2019s own line drawings of scenes from nature.\r\n\r\nCarr\u2019s first book, published in 1941, was titled Klee Wyck, won the Governor General\u2019s Literary Award for non-fiction. Her writing is vital and direct, aware and poignant, as well regarded today as when first published.", "asin": "1553650840", "rank": "2703848", "city": "Vancouver", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51vG2MPfZCL.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
