They keep thinking life is good because making people happy makes them happy but the point where they reach the understanding that their life is not their own, it is heartbreaking but it lights the hope of life. No one can know what happens in other shoes unless you walk with them, and the motives and actions of some people may seem awful but for others might be the light of life illuminating everything.Live the moment, your moment."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I expected this to be good, which is always dangerous. It wasn't. It was wonderful. Nearly every page conatained an observation or description that was perfect. The writing style is just so lovely, it works as a tool to tap into your emotions. And not in a manipulative way. I felt as if I were on a small journey with Michael Cunningham, as if we were comparing notes on the sweet sadnesses, the regrets, the slight state of mourning we are perpetually in, even on the sunniest days. It's all the price of self-awareness, and Cunningham invites you to dive off the cliff and examine how you really feel about some of life's most imponderable and ever-present dilemmas. The observation concerning the special love we feel for the people with whom we shared our most hopeful moments took my breath away."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Narration was exceptional.

Tock, Mrs. Dalloway\u2026again.Reviewing The Hours I find myself stuck somewhere in between tick and tock. Reading a novel, poem, play, screenplay, it\u2019s often easy for me to lose touch with reality and completely absorb myself into the world of a story. I lose touch with myself. The sounds around me. The smells hovering under my nose. The world happening around me. Time elapses into nothingness.The Hours, however, made me fully aware of my position in reality, the noises of the outside world, the stuffiness of the air, and the slowness of time. In brief, The Hours leaves me feeling strangely hollow and irked.The book alternates between the stories of three women Tick: Mrs. Dalloway; Tock: Mrs. Woolf; and Tick: Mrs. Brown \u2013 all whom appear vaguely dissatisfied with their lives. It remains rather obscure and somewhat misleading, until the very end, as to how their narratives converge, apart from their longing and entertaining of the possibility of a life different and perhaps more meaningful than that which they find themselves trapped within.Tick: Mrs. Dalloway.Also known as Clarissa Vaughn, heroine of Virginia Woolf\u2019s Mrs. Dalloway. An exquisitely loyal friend, caretaker and avidly nostalgic observer of the writer and AIDS sufferer, Richard Brown.Tock: Mrs. Woolf.Despairing, yet romantically hopeful, Mrs. Woolf spends her ticks and tocks dreaming up stories and possible plot turns for the writing of her new novel. Residing in Richmond with her protective husband, Leonard, Mrs. Woolf longs for the fog, business and sweet transparency of London.Tick: Mrs. Brown.Dear Mrs. Brown. Beseeched in suburban Los Angeles with a loving husband, Dan and curiously observant son, Richie, Laura Brown hopes without knowing what she hopes for. She lives without knowing what she lives for. She escapes without knowing what she is escaping from.Tick tock, tick tock go the hours.One day; one utterly transformative and inescapable 24 hours of each of the women\u2019s lives is slowly narrated, beginning with life, and ending with the possibility of death as means of escape from a banal, yet disheartening existence. Mrs. Dalloway, Mrs. Woolf and Mrs. Brown all seem to lead banal, ordinary lives dealing with the daily hardships typical of the era in which they live, but are curiously described in a way that renders them different, yet also relatable. They have a home, health, and \u00ab happiness \u00bb yet find themselves unhappy and nostalgic for a feeling or situation that perhaps may not even exist.Time, the passing of time, the inevitability of time lies at the heart of the novel, as it is time, it\u2019s passing, and its prevalence that causes each of the narratives to ultimately converge in the book\u2019s final pages.Although the plots and events of the stories prove to be difficult to piece together and disallow for a completely pleasurable \u00ab readerly \u00bb experience one CANNOT deny the beauty and artistic way in which each character, event, place is illustrated. Cunningham\u2019s language is brilliantly seductive and offers an evocative portrayal of life and how we, as readers, lovers, feelers \u2013 humans \u2013 experience time, the passing of time, and the inevitability of time.In terms of plot, I would not recommend The Hours (who cares if it won the Pulitzer Prize or that it\u2019s Oprah\u2019s favorite book or that Meryl Streep doesn\u2019t shut up about it), but in terms of language, it\u2019s impossible not to utterly fall in love with Michael Cunningham\u2019s words:We live our lives, do whatever we do, and then we sleep \u2013 it\u2019s as simple and ordinary as that. A few jump out of windows or drown themselves or take pills; more die by accident; and most of us, the vast majority, are slowly devoured by some disease or, if we\u2019re very fortunate, by time itself. There\u2019s just this for consolation: an hour here or there when our lives seem, against all odds and expectations, to burst open and give us everything we\u2019ve ever imagined\u2026\u2013 and I\u2019ll leave you to ponder on that dear, dear babblers."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Product came quickly and intact!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book is beautiful, complex and enthralling.

The narrative of Woolf's last days before her suicide early in World War II counterpoints the fictional stories of Samuel, a famous poet whose life has been shadowed by his talented and troubled mother, and his lifelong friend Clarissa, who strives to forge a balanced and rewarding life in spite of the demands of friends, lovers, and family.\r\n\r\nPassionate, profound, and deeply moving, this is Cunningham's most remarkable achievement to date.", "asin": "0312243022", "rank": "59353", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41tvUg4Qc5L.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
