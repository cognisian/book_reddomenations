It made me want to read more of the great families of the era, and I am super pumped for my Italy visit next year!  I wish the Kindle version could handle the portraits the analog version has.

I have been to most of the art museums in Rome and Florence, and other than that, I'm a complete novice when it comes to this stuff.  I knew virtually nothing about the history of the Medici family, and I found this book compelling and easy to follow. If you're looking for a book that tells the story clearly without requiring any background, this is the one. Now I'm going to read his book about the Borgia family. Excellent book!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "hard to keep a family going for 300 years.  at least they lasted longer than any American dynasties will"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "The book is well-researched and interesting, but at times I find myself bored. I bought this book after watching Masters of Florence, I wanted to see the real story of the Medicis. I am getting that, but I don't need to know about every artwork, every artist, every sculpture, door, window, abbey, library, that the Medici family supported, built, endowed, etc.I admit I've only read 17% of the book (this is a very long book), and at times I found myself pleased but I also feel the author doesn't care too much about the \"boring\" side of banking. I do like the politics, and this book has plenty of that. Also, I'd like to know why were the Medicis obsessed with Plato and not Aristotle. Aristotle was far superior to Plato."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Its a very good read.  Especially his description of the Pazzi conspiracy was good.  The only negative is that it ends too abruptly without any kind of conclusion.
