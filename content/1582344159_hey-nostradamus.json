The other was Eleanor Rigby.  I read this book in two days. Could not put it down. It brought me into the story and even affected my mood. I think the ending was left to interpretation. I choose to take the happier path. You can get a synopsis of the book from the bookseller that would be better than I could do. I'm here to tell you it's worth the read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Starting with a high school shooting in 1988, this story is told in four parts from four people affected by it, directly or indirectly, and how it changed the course of their lives forever.An interesting look into the lives of ordinary people who survive extraordinary things and then have to go about surviving the mythos built up around the event by those who weren't there.This was the kind of book that when I finished it had me wishing someone else had read it so I could discuss it with them. There was just so much there."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Disappointing read.

His characterization of Christians is uncharacteristically tone-deaf, but since the book is full of religious undertones, the echoes of that reverberate on every page."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This is my first foray into the world of Coupland\u2019s writing.  I quite enjoyed the story that he developed.  The dark humour combined with the stark look at life and humanity to make an interesting and captivating read.  There were times when I was utterly captivated with the story and others when I found the pace of the story lagged a bit.  The large passage of time in the novel was quite well done.  It was quite interesting to see how a single event affected 4 different individuals over the span of decades.I \u2018read\u2019 the audio version of this one and loved the narrators.  The 4 different narrators, one for each section, was brilliant.  They really brought the characters to life in a real and vivid way.  I did have an issue with the audio version I had.  It was only 4 tracks.  Any time I had to pause it for too long and the player reset I had to fast forward through 150+minutes of the track to find my spot.  It made it rather difficult to stay immersed in the story at times (and was beyond frustrating when I hit the wrong button).As a whole this was an enjoyable and unique tale that definitely made me think."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Still one of the best books I've ever read"}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "What an excellent premise, but the characters are insufferable.

Don't waste your time."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is one of Couplands most sophiticated works to date and an all time favorite of mine.
