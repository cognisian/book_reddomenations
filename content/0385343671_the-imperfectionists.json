Different from what I usually read.  Good story and relating of characters."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This is a series of related vignettes, which slowly put together the story of a newspaper. Each vignette tells a tale about a person related to the paper somehow - a foreign correspondent, an editor, a reader... But each tale is a cruel one, relating horrible parts of each life. Infidelities and breakups, deaths and betrayals. There is humor, but generally unkind humor. Each story arc, including the overall story of the newspaper, ultimately plummets downward. It is well-written, but most certainly not uplifting."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I read this book several years ago, when it first was published. I wasn't going to write a review, but when I read some of the negative reviews and remembered the book so well and how I'd so enjoyed it, I felt I had to throw in my 2 cents' worth. The mere fact that I recall the book and the pleasure it gave me is very notable. I read a lot, and a lot of different stuff. The novels I read  tend to be mystery/cop/detective fiction. This book stands out as none of those. It was unique in its form; beautifully rendered in its characterizations; and other wise a delight. It was as much a page-turner as one gets from  non-thriller fiction. Well worth the read!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Each chapter reads like a short story as the characters are brought forwardThe Imperfectionists (2010) is Rachman\u2019s debut novel that follows the private lives of the reporters, editors, and executives of an international English-language newspaper in Rome as they struggle to keep it and themselves going. Each chapter reads like a short story as the characters are brought forward. Fifty years and many changes later, the paper founded by a millionaire from Atlanta resides in a dingy office with stains on the carpet. Nothing about the editor, the lazy obituary writer, the financial officer, a freelance writer that makes up news in order to get noticed, disappoint for they are but a few of the compelling, interesting, funny, pathetic, brilliant people I wouldn\u2019t have missed for the world. I can\u2019t say enough positive things about this story, this writer, this experience of entering Rachman\u2019s world of journalism fictionalized by an author with credentials that make this a delightful, authentic read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The Imperfectionists was one of the most memorable books I have ever read.  I absolutely loved it.  I read a review by Christopher Buckley who gave this book raves.  It's a fairly intricate plot and I don't want to get into the details except to say that this book is entertaining, thoughtful, and thought provoking.  I could become philosophical about some of the plot lines.  Just read it, you won't be sorry."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "An incredible book with very true portrayal of the life of journalists.

Over fifty years, its eccentricities earned a place in readers' hearts around the globe. But now, circulation is down, the paper lacks a website, and the future looks bleak. \r\n\r\nStill, those involved in the publication seem to barely notice. The obituary writer is too busy avoiding work. The editor-in-chief is pondering sleeping with an old flame. The obsessive reader is intent on finishing every old edition, leaving her trapped in the past. And the publisher seems less interested in his struggling newspaper than in his magnificent basset hound, Schopenhauer. \r\n\r\nThe Imperfectionists interweaves the stories of eleven unusual and endearing characters who depend on the paper. Funny and moving, the novel is about endings - the end of life, the end of sexual desire, the end of the era of newspapers - and about what might rise afterward.\r\n\r\n\"The charming and enthralling story of an idiosyncratic English-language newspaper in Rome and the lives of its staffers as the paper fights for survival in the internet age. A precise, playful fiction with a deep but lightly worn intelligence.\" Times Literary Supplement.", "asin": "0385343671", "rank": "57147", "city": "Rome", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ubU8v6SJL.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
