It is superb, especially for the masterful way it depicts (and enables us to feel, to smell, to experience to the marrow of our bones) the horrific events surrounding the French Revolution. But read it, also, for the tender story of love, constancy, and sacrifice - the best of human actions - that bloom and develop alongside and in contrast to the anguish, terror, and ghoulish and vengeful horror brought about by the very antithesis of human goodness.This is a masterpiece and a must-read."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Not an interesting story to me."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A good unbiased overview of the conflict .

The novel was published in 1861 by the author Charles Dickens who is know for the novel \"The Tale of Two Cities\" this author has a style of repetition in his storytelling sense. The genre of this story is a Novel. The story takes place in 19th century England, a boy named Pip finds himself conflicted when he runs into a convict who threatens him into bringing food an a file, but never reveals who helped him escape his irons when he is caught. Later Pip  is sent to meet Miss. Havisham and Estella who live at Satis house, Pip instantly falls in love with the beautiful Estella, but she is cold hearted and cruel.

It is his second novel, after David Copperfield, to be fully narrated in the first person. Great Expectations is a bildungsroman, or a coming-of-age novel, and it is a classic work of Victorian literature. It depicts the growth and personal development of an orphan named Pip.\r\n\r\nThe novel was first published in serial form in Dickens's weekly periodical All the Year Round, from 1 December 1860 to August 1861. In October 1861, Chapman and Hall published the novel in three volumes. Dickens originally intended Great Expectations to be twice as long, but constraints imposed by the management of All the Year Round limited the novel's length. The novel is collected and dense, with a conciseness unusual for Dickens. According to G. K. Chesterton, Dickens penned Great Expectations in \"the afternoon of [his] life and fame.\" It was the penultimate novel Dickens completed, preceding Our Mutual Friend.\r\n\r\nIt is set among the marshes of Kent and in London in the early to mid-1800s. The novel contains some of Dickens most memorable scenes, including its opening, in a graveyard, when the young orphan Pip is accosted by the escaped convict, Abel Magwitch. Great Expectations is a graphic book, full of extreme imagery, poverty, prison ships (\"the hulks\"), barriers and chains, and fights to the death. Upon its release, Thomas Carlyle spoke of \"All that Pip's nonsense.\" Later, George Bernard Shaw praised the novel as \"All of one piece and consistently truthfull.\" Dickens felt Great Expectations was his best work, calling it \"a very fine idea,\" and was very sensitive to compliments from his friends: \"Bulwer, who has been, as I think you know, extraordinarily taken by the book.\"\r\n\r\nGreat Expectations has a colourful cast that has entered popular culture: the capricious Miss Havisham, the cold and beautiful Estella, Joe the kind and generous blacksmith, the dry and sycophantic Uncle Pumblechook, Mr. Jaggers, Wemmick with his dual personality, and the eloquent and wise friend, Herbert Pocket. Throughout the narrative, typical Dickensian themes emerge: wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil.\r\n\r\nGreat Expectations has become very popular and is now taught as a classic in many English classes. It has been translated into many languages and adapted many times in film and other media.", "asin": "0141439564", "rank": "9758", "city": "London", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51j%2BUTpADCL.jpg", "country": "England", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
