The awful invidiousness of comparing oneself to others. The selfish greed that keeps the majority in poverty and the minority in lavish wealth. The raw exposure of these social ills are for what I praise the author. Not the melodramatic teenage love triangle and the steamy sexual scenes. Those I found overwrought. Yet the social issues and class struggles are serious and ongoing in every culture and the author brings them to light in the Italian culture of the last century making the novel a worthy read, although, for me, not as captivating as the first book in this series, My Brilliant Friend."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Read the series.
