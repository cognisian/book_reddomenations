Maybe I am missing something. My biggest disappointment was that I got little sense of the Vietnamese experience of the war or the post war. The people who inhabit this book represent only the smallest, and not very typical, segment of the Vietnamese experience, nor do they ever inhabit any recognizable part of Vietnam during or after the war. Nor do they have much of any American experience except with charicatures (the department head, the congressman, the Auteur). In fact, with only a few exceptions most characters are nameless cartoons, the crepulent major, the grizzled major, the general, the commandant, the commissar, diminishing their humanity in much the same way the movie in the novel diminishes its Vietnamese participants. The only people besides the narrator\u2019s childhood friends who achieve the status of having names are Sonny and Lana, the most Americanized Vietnamese in the story.  Beyond the not very convincing plot, I found it frequently over written and repetitive, never humorous, and generally a chore to read."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "wont let me return in horrible condition."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "hated it"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "So well crafted. Great interpretation of  the human condition. Although very personal and clearly a unique experience, the introspection and view of all societies and the history of nations and all humanity for that matter , made this work a must read.

Heartless often, it lays bare how exile makes us unrecognizable even to ourselves.I lived through a revolution and saw where promises went.

The problem is that the prose is far, far too dense. Simple events or exchanges run on and on with the result being - for me at lest -  loss of interest in the story being told.I had to skim the last 150 pages as I simply wanted to finish the book - not out of excitement or anticipation, but out of sheer exhaustion from the weight of the words.And the entire section concerning the auteur and the shooting of an \"Apocalypse Now\" type film appears out of the blue and seems ridiculously far fetched - a device for obvious commentary and not for moving what had been an engrossing story forward."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I\u2019m tempted to give this novel 5 stars because of how it seems to bring all the major Vietnamese narratives during the war years together into one person.  The protagonist manages to embody the North Vietnam experience, the South Vietnam experience, the refugee experience, the military camp experience, and the reeducation experience.  Fitting all these different experiences into one character in a believable way is an amazing accomplishment.  As you might expect, the book is long, dense, and complex.  Viet Thang Nguyen is particularly good at exploring ideas about loyalty (to friends, family, and country).  The subject matter is often difficult and brutal, but there is plenty of humor to lighten the reading experience (a scene involving a raw squid comes to mind).Even though I respect this book and think it is a true masterpiece, I still can\u2019t quite bring myself to give it 5 stars because the last few chapters were tedious and a bit heavy-handed, in my opinion.  I had to push myself to get to the end."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I cannot stop thinking about this book even though its been more than two months I finished reading it. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is not an easy-to-read one; the plot is complex and written in a complex way. The story is very real; written in a quirky funny way. I loved the details in the descriptions. And I loved the characters and reading their thoughts along with their voices."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "This book really needed an editor.
