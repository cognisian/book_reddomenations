While I generally feel the need to read the book before watching the film adaptation, I encountered this work first in its cinematic form. The film captured my heart, so much so that I am now discussing it with one of my classes. Here is a love story that manages to captivate without falling into sentimentalism. I was happy to see the film adaptation nominated for an Academy Award; it seems that it is possible, after all, to receive recognition even if one does not follow contemporary formulas.There is much of Jane Austen in this \"quiet\" novel. There is no sensationalism here, but simply the story of Eilis Lacey--a young Irish woman who relocates to Brooklyn, NY--and an exploration of the stages she goes through as she tries to find her place in the world. Before she leaves Ireland, Eilis considers that she may lose forever the place that constitutes her world, \"that she [will] never have an ordinary day again in this ordinary place, that the rest of her life [will] be a struggle with the unfamiliar\" (31). I chose this concept as the title for this review because it sums up the novel--and the immigrant's experience--beautifully.One of the reasons why I enjoyed _Brooklyn_ so much is that, as an immigrant, I found it easy to identify with Eilis, and based on my experience I can say that T\u00f3ib\u00edn portrays an immigrant's emotional development with great accuracy. (The author himself lives in Dublin and in New York, so we may presume many of the observations and descriptions in this novel are based on his personal experience.) The initial stage is characterized by amazement in the face of a new culture, mixed with a longing for what one has left behind, or homesickness. At first the immigrant has one foot on the new country and the other on the old homeland. Like Janus, he or she looks both ahead and back. The new country is characterized by what the painter Thomas Cole called \"want of association;\" nothing seems to mean anything, in the sense that nothing triggers connections in the immigrant's mind. (For Cole, incidentally, this was something positive; he saw America as an endless source of inspiration for the artist.) In time, the immigrant develops a new life, and the places and the people around him or her begin to take on associations. The process is similar to the snake's shedding of its old skin. But all the time the immigrant keeps thinking of the old home, keeps dreaming of going back, even though, as we all know, it is impossible to go back; as Heraclitus put it, \"No man ever steps in the same river twice.\"One of the objections that will be raised against _Brooklyn_ is that Eilis's situation as an immigrant is in fact enviable. Not only does she have the necessary papers and a job waiting for her upon arrival, she also speaks English, and she is Caucasian. Wouldn't the story of an immigrant that has no papers and no job, speaks a different language, and belongs to a different race/ethnicity be more interesting and/or worthy of sympathy? That is beside the point. There are many novels out there that relate the stories of immigrants from a large number of different backgrounds. T\u00f3ib\u00edn's novel is focused; it traces the physical and emotional journey of a single immigrant, and explores the processes through which human beings create new ties and sever old ones, to the extent that the latter is possible.Those readers who have seen the film will agree that Nick Hornby's screenplay is quite a faithful adaptation of the novel. As tends to be the case, however, the novel provides more details, especially when it comes to the background of some of the characters. In the novel we also learn about Eilis's brothers, who have emigrated to England. Two scenes did not make it into the script: one depicting a baseball game, the other the Catholic sacrament of penance. I'd say the first one would have presented a technical difficulty for the filmmakers, while the latter may have come across as too prudish in our increasingly amoral age. One final comment regarding the adaptation: as I read the last part of the novel I realized that Eilis is a bit more complicated, a bit more conflicted in the text than she is in the movie. One obvious reason for this may be that in the novel the reader enters her mind and hears the thoughts that can only be suggested in the film.I may read another one of T\u00f3ib\u00edn's novels soon, maybe _Nora Webster_, maybe _The South_ (also a story of an Irish immigrant). His prose is elegant, precise, and measured. I may be simplifying things here, but the effect the prose had on me was similar to that produced by John Banville's magnificent _The Sea_ (2005).Thanks for reading, and enjoy the book!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Rmantic story written by a man...not very romantic.
