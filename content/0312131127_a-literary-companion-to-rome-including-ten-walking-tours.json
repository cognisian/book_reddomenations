I would take issue, however, with previous reviews which characterize it as impeccably researched and footnoted:  Varriano occasionally gets caught up in his own myths, and reports as true what he wants to be true.  For example, the Casa dei Crescenzi (pp. 75-6) did belong to a patrician family called the Crescenzi, but it certainly never belonged to Cola di Rienzo (an attribution which first appears in Piranesi's etching in 1756, and was popularized by Bulwer-Lytton's purple novel of 1835).  Nor was Cola di Rienzo primarily a \"religious reformer\", as Varriano describes him--he was a political demagogue who tried to re-establish the Roman republic in medieval Rome.  To make the whole thing more confusing, Varriano cites the Cola story as true, but an earlier name for the house (the \"house of Pilate\") as \"pure medieval fabrication\".  The book is interesting and covers the literary history of Rome widely, but it should not be taken as a reliable scholarly resource."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "preparing for an extended stay in rome , i have read several books...A LITERARY COMPANION  TO ROME  was by far THE BEST,,,,"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Rome has always attracted writers and artists.  This book is a series of walking tours around Rome with your guide being the words and letters of two thousand years of visitors.  Where else will you find a guide book, for example, recording the impressions of Dante, Henry James and Florence Nightingale of the same buildings?  I took this book with me to Rome and carried it with me every day alongside the Fodor's guide.  Most travel books tell you where to find the monuments, the churches and the museums - this guide book tells you about the romance of the Eternal City.  It is a guide book with a true heart - I cannot recommend it highly enough."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is an impeccably researched and footnoted book that packs in a ton of information about the major writers (i.e. all of them) who spent time in Rome and wrote about the experience. There's a quote on just about every  page from someone famous, from Keats and Dickens and Zola to Florence  Nightingale and Bernard Malamud. The author must have spent several years  and exhausted any number of chairs researching this book. Once you read  this book you will have to track down at least 25 more esoteric tomes  following threads that pique your interest.

James, Isben, Dickens, Goethe, Woolf, and Wilde are among those who have written with passion about Rome, and through them we rediscover a city of grandeur and intimacy, as vibrant and sensual as ever.\r\n\r\nArranged as a series of walks through the city, this book is both an illuminating guide for the visitor to Rome and a delight to read at home for those who love the city and want to enrich their knowledge of it.", "asin": "0312131127", "rank": "1100389", "city": "Rome", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/412P1B7AP9L.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
