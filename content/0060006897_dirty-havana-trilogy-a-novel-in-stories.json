The political situation has changed to the point where police come by to see rafters off and wish them good luck on their dangerous trip to Florida. We follow the main character, a man in his early 40\u2019s -- he constantly reminds us how old he is. He used to be a journalist who traveled in Europe with a former artist wife but he\u2019s ended up divorced, back in Havana and working hand to mouth to survive. What does he do? When he can find work, it is in slaughterhouses, garbage collection and factories. He also picks up cans from trash, deals drugs and fishes by floating in an inner tube along the beach. He captures pigeons for sacrifice in santeria ceremonies \u2013 there\u2019s a job description for you. Often he lives off his women and even acts as a pimp. He\u2019s spent time behind bars.Housing is atrocious: sewers back up into the first floors; water and electricity operate sporadically; elevators never work, so people walk up 9- and 12-story buildings daily, lugging buckets of water. He has an eye for the women, whether they are married or not, and there is a lot graphic sex to the point where some will find the book pornographic. Up to a dozen families share a bathroom and some folks don\u2019t bother waiting, so they use the stairway, the elevator or the roof. It\u2019s not a pretty picture. Daily life is a constant struggle to get food and basic necessities such as soap. And in our narrator\u2019s case, his necessities include beer, rot-gut rum and cigarettes. The crowded conditions lead to social dysfunction, spousal abuse, murders, alcoholism and suicides.Our narrator tells us he is mulatto, \u201cbut nearly white,\u201d and he loves to make politically incorrect statements; a less kind assessment would say he is racist, homophobic and misogynistic. The story is spiced with black humor. A kindred mystery novel covering the same down-and-out crowd at about the same point in history is Cold Havana Ground by Arnaldo Correa, which I have reviewed."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Couldn't finish it- it was like reading a porn novel written by a 15 year old that had visions of being Hemingway & misses by a mile.

A waste of time and money."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent -- though a bit too raunchy at times for my taste. I've been to Havana, and the reality of life depicted in this book rings true and jives well with my own impressions: terrible misery and hopelessness lurking behind the facades of beautiful buildings.As for raunchiness: sex is the only outlet for happiness for those living in what is in essence a police state."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Cuba is a place I have always wanted to visit.  Unfortunately, our government has forbidden ordinary Americans from traveling to Cuba for over five decades, and although there has been talk of that policy changing for several years now, it seems to be just talk.  Agricultural and trade missions can come and go to Cuba with relative ease, and some people are allowed to go there for educational reasons -  but for the average tourist the trip still can't be made legally.  Rich Americans (for whom the rules are always different - or at least enforced differently) have floated their yachts in and out of the island's harbors for years, and many skirt the law going to Montreal or Mexico and then flying to Havana.There appear to be no military or secret concerns that would warrant keeping Americans away from Cuba other than the fact that the Cuba lobby in Florida, an extremely powerful political force, doesn't want to legitimize Castro by normalizing relations with the island nation.  They still see him as a \"temporary\" leader who will one day fall, allowing them to return home and reclaim their confiscated property.  Castro has been in power in Cuba since the Eisenhower administration, and most of these angry Cuban-Americans were born in the United States after the revolution.It is because some of the younger Cuban-Americans are beginning to accept reality that our government is finally talking about normalizing relations with our largest neighbor in the Caribbean.Fifty years of saber-rattling and boycotts by the United States have had a harsh impact on the economy of Cuba and the lives of its people.  The Soviet Union subsidized the island to a great extent until the mighty Soviet Bear collapsed in 1991.  It was at that point that things went from bad to worse for the people struggling to survive in Cuba.I have recently finished reading Dirty Havana Trilogy by Cuban journalist and writer Pedro Juan Gutierrez. It is a lengthy volume of vignettes about life and poverty in Cuba during the early 1990's, the period just after the collapse of the Soviet Union.  All of the very short stories in the book describe the lives and living conditions of the common people, and most involve Gutierrez himself and the denizens of the building in which he lives.Pedro Juan Gutierrez portrays himself in terms of being an ex-journalist who is barely surviving in one of many shacks that occupy the roof of a decaying old apartment house along the Malecon - Havana's famous sea wall.  He makes a meager living by selling produce that he brings in illegally from the countryside, trafficking in various black market items, encouraging his girlfriends to go out and \"hustle\" along the Malecon, and fishing from an inner-tube for days at a time in the dirty water that is Havana's harbor.  At one point during this time Gutierrez is prostituting himself (to women only) and is arrested and imprisoned for two-and-a-half years.The author describes life in Cuba in stark and very tragic terms.  Most of his tales revolve around sex, usually involving people living in squalor and who have no sanitation or means of keeping clean, and decaying buildings.  People and buildings fall apart after years of neglect, day-by-day or sometimes all at once.  Gutierrez describes suicides, people sleeping twenty to a room on floors - with some having sex in the dark while the rest listen or try not to listen, and hallways and stairwells littered with human excrement because a water shortage has made the toilets useless.Yet, almost amazingly, Gutierrez weaves his way through all of the suffering and filth and makes sense of it. He is describing people who are intent on getting by, despite their circumstances, just like people everywhere.  His account of life in Cuba in the 1990's is just that - a depiction of life.  His tales are well crafted and powerful, and their power comes from the author's ability to understand his own experiences and express them with brutal honesty.And with all of that, I still want to visit Cuba.  The island was a leading force in the shaping of 20th century American history with its splendid casinos built and run by Meyer Lansky and other infamous figures of  the American mob, the Hemingway connection, the successful revolution led by a small boatload of young brave hearts with names like Castro and Guevara, the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the numerous failed attempts by our government to kill Castro - and his possible retaliation by having some mysterious involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy, the Mariel Boat Lift, and the refugees who continue to try to reach the shores of the United States on small boats, rafts, and inner-tubes.The world is changing.  Americans and their dollars are now welcome in many places where they would have once been banned - by our own government.  Today we can travel to Russia, China, and even Vietnam.  It is well past time for the government of the United States to quit protecting us from ourselves and allow unfettered humanitarian and tourist travel to Cuba.The Cold War is over."}]}, "authors":

the misadventures of Pedro Juan, a former Cuban journalist living from hand to mouth in the squalor of contemporary Havana, half disgusted and half fascinated by the depths to which he has sunk. \r\n\r\nLike the lives of so many of his neighbors in the crumbling, once-elegant apartment houses that line Havana's waterfront, Pedro Juan's days and nights have been reduced by the so-called special times - the harsh recession that followed the Soviet Union's collapse - to the struggle of surviving the daily grit through the escapist pursuit of sex. Pedro Juan scrapes by under the shadow of hunger - all the while observing his lovers and friends, strangers on the street, and their suffering with an unsentimental, mocking, yet sympathetic eye.", "asin": "0060006897", "rank": "658525", "city": "Havana", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kFEIjQ3ZL.jpg", "country": "Cuba", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
