He eventually settled in Hamilton, ON, and became one of the most prominent mob bosses in Canadian history.  He made his fortune in bootlegging, drugs, prostitution and more and was usually able to stay one step ahead of the law.  His common law wife was Bessie Starkman and she murdered in 1930 as they were arriving home one night ... her murder was never solved.Frank Zaneth was from northern Italy and also arrived in Canada as a young man.  He headed out west and tried homesteading with his then wife in the prairies.  This turned out to be not what he had bargained for so he sold his land and became a Mountie.  Over the years, he spent most of his time undercover and eventually investigating Perri became one of his cases.Perri went for a walk in April 1944 and was never seen again.  There are theories that he is encased in cement at the bottom of Hamilton Harbour or that he took off to Mexico and lived out his days in hiding.I hadn't heard of Perri or Zaneth or their stories.  I came across this book and it sounded interesting and it was.  It's obvious the author did a great amount of research as it is quite detailed.  I knew there was bootlegging going on during the Prohibition area and this book definitely gives you a feel of what it was like at that time living outside the law.  Plus I didn't realize Canada had such a big mob presence."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Interesting, as I live nearby where it all took place.

One, Rocco Perri, from southern Italy, rose from the life of a petty criminal on the streets of Toronto to run the most prominent bootlegging operation of the Prohibition Era in central Canada, taking over Hamilton and leading one of the region\u2019s most influential crime families. \r\n\r\nPerri was feared by his enemies and loved by the press, who featured him regularly in splashy front-page headlines in the Toronto Star. So great was his celebrity, following the murder of his first wife and business partner, Bessie Starkman, a crowd of 30,000 thronged in the streets of Hamilton to watch her funeral.\r\n\r\nPerri\u2019s businesses\u2014which included alcohol, drugs, gambling and prostitution\u2014kept him under constant police surveillance. He caught the interest of one man in particular, the other arrival from Italy, Frank Zaneth. Zaneth, from the Italian north, joined the RCMP and became its first undercover operative. His work took him across the country, but he was dogged in his pursuit of Rocco Perri and worked for his arrest until the day Perri was last seen, in 1944, when he disappeared without a trace.\r\n\r\nThe Whisky King is the story of the fascinating rise to power of a notorious 1920s Canadian crime figure twinned with the life of the man who pursued him.\r\n\r\n\u201cA superb book of historical non-fiction. . .by a writer at the top of his game.\u201d The Globe and Mail\r\n", "asin": "1443442232", "rank": "713797", "city": "Toronto", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51wcYSpvGQL.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
