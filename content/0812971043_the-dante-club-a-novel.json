Dante is a favorite author,but I slogged through this book, hoping that the killer was not as obvious as I thought it could be. Unfortunately , it is as obvious, and if you have ever experienced the ancient practice of wearing a hair shirt , the reading experience was similar. There aren't many characters I found to remotely interesting, and the premise is silly. What's sillier is the killer and his motives. Toss this one into the third ring of the nether world. I cannot recommend this book. I can say I will not read this author in future.Source: a small bookseller in Europe"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Best book I've read in years.  Very well researched and thoroughly engrossing.  Couldn't put it down.  It sent me back to our literary masters, Longfellow, Lowell, et al.  Powerful sense of place of New England, Boston, and Harvard."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I REALLY disliked this book. The premise is ridiculous and contrived: Five 19th century luminaries such as Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes etc. act as armature sleuths to find a psychotic killer. The main characters seem to have barely one character trait each: 1 is always serene, one is always analytical, one is always impetuous, the others are blank. All of them are predictable and boring. Along the way, the reader is subjected to graphic descriptions of horrendous scenes of torture and slaughter, but no suspense (and I don't even know how that is possible!). Towards the end of the book there are also a couple gratuitous instances of ugly violent racism which have absolutely nothing to do with the plot or character development. The penultimate straw is the fact that the murderer's identity is discovered by the sleuths and revealed to the reader long before the end of the story, making for a really long, dragged-out and tedious denouement. SPOILER ALERT):  The last straw is that the perpetrator turns out to be a minor character who has barely been introduced throughout the \"story.\"  I kept hoping it would get better, and ended up wishing it would just end."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "It was difficult reading at first but got better as the story progressed.

T. Fields\u2014are finishing America\u2019s first translation of The Divine Comedy and preparing to unveil Dante\u2019s remarkable visions to the New World. The powerful Boston Brahmins at Harvard College are fighting to keep Dante in obscurity, believing that the infiltration of foreign superstitions into American minds will prove as corrupting as the immigrants arriving at Boston Harbor.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Dante Club fight to keep a sacred literary cause alive, but their plans fall apart when a series of murders erupts through Boston and Cambridge. Only this small group of scholars realizes that the gruesome killings are modeled on the descriptions of Hell\u2019s punishments from Dante\u2019s Inferno. With the lives of the Boston elite and Dante\u2019s literary future in America at stake, the Dante Club members must find the killer before the authorities discover their secret.\r\n\r\nDr. Oliver Wendell Holmes and an outcast police officer named Nicholas Rey, the first black member of the Boston police department, must place their careers on the line to end the terror. Together, they discover that the source of the murders lies closer to home than they ever could have imagined.\r\n\r\nThe Dante Club is a magnificent blend of fact and fiction, a brilliantly realized paean to Dante\u2019s continued grip on our imagination, and a captivating thriller that will surprise readers from beginning to end.", "asin": "0812971043", "rank": "245463", "city": "Boston", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Sg266CM9L.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
