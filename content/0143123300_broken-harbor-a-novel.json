Thoroughly enjoyed her next two books and to-date found Frank Mackey to be my favourite protagonist, though would not mind seeing Rob Ryan again.  I must say, I feel as though Rob's story is not complete.Broken Harbor... well, it is my least favourite of her books thus far.  I actually got about halfway I think, maybe even less and then jumped to the end.  The book was a slog - tedious, morose and bleak - it was just a drain to get through.  The thing is even reading the ending, I did not feel inspired to go back and check on the missing bits.The book is actually one star, but due to Ms French's skilful writing, I have added another."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "French is a very talented writer.  Her books are character driven and she presents many points of  view.  I liked this novel very much but was very disappointed in the ending.  It felt like she just had to end is somehow.  This is the 4th book in the series.  Each book is entirely different.  The connecting thread is each lead detective is a member of the Dublin Murder Squad.  This allows French to write a very different book each time without having to keep the main lead character."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I got hooked on Tana French.  I read all of her series, back to back, no stopping.  Such a fabulous storyteller."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "The only thing I hate about her addictive series is how little things are left unresolved. The rotating cast of main characters keeps things fresh but when small things are left unfinished with one at the end of the novel it is maddening because there is not \"to be continued\" in the next book. Still like a bad habit I know I'll go and read the next one."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is my favorite Tana French book so far.  I have read four.

That's why he's the Dublin Murder Squad's top detective, and that's what puts the biggest case of the year in his hands.\r\n\r\nOn one of the half-abandoned \"luxury\" developments that litter Ireland, Patrick Spain and his two young children have been murdered. His wife, Jenny, is in intensive care. At first, Scorcher thinks it's going to be an easy solve, but too many small things can't be explained: the half-dozen baby monitors pointed at holes smashed in the Spains' walls, the files erased from the family's computer, the story Jenny told her sister about a shadowy intruder slipping past the house's locks. And this neighborhood--once called Broken Harbor--holds memories for Scorcher and his troubled sister Dina: childhood memories that Scorcher thought he had tightly under control.\r\n\r\nWinner of Ireland AM Crime Fiction Book of the Year", "asin": "0143123300", "rank": "29885", "city": "Dublin", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/514cwmC-A1L.jpg", "country": "Ireland", "story_arc": ["Person_In_A_Hole", "Fortunes fall, but the protagonist\n                    bounces back"]}
