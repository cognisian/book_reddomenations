No one should doubt that Michael Crichton had great fun putting this somewhat incredulous novel together. Demonstrating influences from fictional works such as H R  Haggard's, Alan Quartermain and A Conan Doyle's Professor Challenger from\" Lost World\" {need I say more?} this story works. A bit of whimsy but could Philo Beddoe and Clyde have had any influence in the creation of Peter Elliot and Amy? {chuckle chuckle} You'll have to decide on your own.

The references listed in the post-epilogue are impressive. \u201cCongo by Crichton is so gripping that you almost expect Amy the gorilla\u2026 to bound into the room,\u201d wrote The Christian Science Monitor. Without a doubt, Crichton was a better author than Tim LaHaye, Ayn Rand, and Margaret Mitchell. As a pop culture icon and intelligent storyteller, Crichton was the Fritz Lang of his day.In 1897, Sydney Hinde wrote that \u201cnearly all the tribes in the Congo Basin either are, or have been, cannibals; and among some of them the practice is on the increase.\u201d In the Congo, cannibalism was not associated with ritual or religion or war; it was a simple dietary preference (pg. 210). The pygmies were the earliest human inhabitants of the Congo rainforest\u2026 More than four thousand years ago, an Egyptian commander named Herkouf entered the great forest west of the Mountains of the Moon; there he found a race of tiny men who sang and danced to their god. Herkouf\u2019s amazing report had the ring of fact and Herodotus and later Aristotle insisted that these stories of the tiny men were true, and not fabulous. The Dancers of God inevitably acquired mythical trappings as the centuries passed (pg. 237).But the hippo was essential to Africa\u2019s river ecology. His fecal matter, produced in prodigious quantities, fertilized the river grasses, which in turn allowed river fish and other creatures to live. Without the hippopotamus African rivers would be sterile, and where they had been driven away, the rivers died (pg. 253). \u201cSomething happens to the man who discovers a new species of animal,\u201d wrote Lady Elizabeth Forstmann in 1879. \u201cAt once he forgets his family and friends, and\u2026 in short, he abandons all who knew him prior to his insensate lust for fame at the hands of the demon called Science.\u201d Lady Forstmann understood, for her husband had just left her after discovering the Norwegian blue-crested grouse in 1878 (pg. 345).Conspecific teaching occurs among primates\u2026 Washoe, the first primate in history to learn sign language, taught ASL to her offspring. Language-skilled primates freely taught other animals in captivity; for that matter, they would teach people, signing slowly and repeatedly until the stupid uneducated human person got the point. So it was possible for a primate tradition of language and behavior to be carried on for generations\u2026 In 1964, chimpanzee kidneys were successfully transplanted into men; blood transfusions were also possible (pgs. 350-352).In 1975, the mathematician S.L. Berensky reviewed the literature on primate language and reached a startling conclusion\u2026 On both sides of the bars primates can be observed making faces at each other. It is too facile to say that man is superior because he has made the zoo. We impose our special horror of barred captivity\u2013a form of punishment among our species\u2013and assume that other primates feel as we do. Berensky likened primates to foreign ambassadors. \u201cApes have for centuries managed to get along with human beings, as ambassadors from their species. In recent years, they have even learned to communicate with human beings using sign language. But it is a one-sided diplomatic exchange; no human being has attempted to live in ape society, to master their language and customs, to eat their food, to live as they do. The apes have learned to talk to us, but we have never learned to talk to them. Who, then, should be judged the greater intellect?\u201d Berensky added a prediction. \u201cThe time will come,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen circumstances may force some human beings to communicate with a primate society on its own terms. Only then human beings will become aware of their complacent egotism with regard to other animals\u201d (pgs. 354-355)."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Good storyline but too fragmented by little research papers Crichton interjected as background material that distracted from the narrative.
