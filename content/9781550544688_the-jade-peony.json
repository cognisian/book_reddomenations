They each experience a very different childhood, depending on age and sex, as they encounter the complexities of birth and death, love and hate, kinship and otherness. \r\n\r\nMingling with the realities of Canada and the horror of war are the magic, ghosts, paper uncles and family secrets of Poh-Poh, or Grandmother, who is the heart and pillar of the family.\r\n\r\nWayson Choy's Chinatown is a community of unforgettable individuals who are \u201cneither this nor that,\u201d neither entirely Canadian nor Chinese. But with each other's help, they survive hardship and heartbreak with grit and humour.", "asin": "1550544683", "rank": "1012898", "city": "Vancouver", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51-RtkgnHWL.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
