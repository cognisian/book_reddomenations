Not literally weighty; it had a lot of terribly traumatic events take place, but many of them did nothing to seriously progress the story. Even though I thought the flash forward sections were done well, there was real no connection to 11-year old boy. Yes, we are suppose to understand the boy will become the soldier, but the transition is missing. I will say that the perspective was fantastic; one of the few books that used the first person perspective effectively. I totally believed it.Overall, a bit too grand in the wording, but still a decent book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Great"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book was really incredible.

Marnus and his best friend, Frikkie, are keenly aware of the sharp racial divides in their country, even if they don't yet understand the injustice underlying them.Despite the heavy load of its subject matter, Behr's prose moves along quickly, and he has immense talent for dialogue. We walk into Marnus' family and inner circle and observe a scaled-down version of the convoluted power dynamics happening outside the well-off family's gates.  Marnus' father is a Major General in South Africa's air force, which exposes Marnus and Frikkie on a regular basis to the nation's conflicts and some of its most powerful officers.  Racism, of course, reaches even into good-hearted Marnus, and the reader can't help but see that he knows no other way of thinking.  These profound issues underlie life as an otherwise normal schoolboy, making the novel a politically charged roman-\u00e0-clef.Marnus' narration stays pitch-perfect throughout; Behr's choice to tell the story through Marnus proves a crucial and very smart move.  A child at this age, a turning point in the capacity to understand the complexities and motives in the adult world, makes an appropriate vehicle for displaying the situation in South Africa at the time.  You'll learn a lot about that nation and its riches (gold and diamond mines) and the cruel politics now mercifully behind us."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The beauty of this book is that it is so convincing. It helps you to understand how a sensitive, kind child can get caught in supporting a very wrong system.There is this little boy, who wants to be loved by his mother and adored by his father, and this is so important for him that he is willing to pay any price for it. And beacuse he loves so much, he is incapable of seeing through their mistakes and finding his own route in life.And during the book, first slowly and later with deafening speed , the pink curtains over this ideal life of the little Marnus are being torn away, and every time it happens ,Marnus still sticks to his former upbringing and stands loyal by the convictions of his father and mother. O yes, sometimes he sees the cracks in the appearances, as his sister Ilse or his aunt Tannie Karla try to show, but he cannot let the information in.  That will treathen his quest for love from his parents. He tries so much... so much to behave that it is heartbreaking.  His upbringing was too succesful. He cannot open his eyes,... Not when he sees how destitute Chrisjan , their former servant is, ...Not when he sees the pain of Little Neville, ...not when he sees how his infallible father mistreats his best friend. He cannot allow in his mind the realisation that the goodness of his parents is limited. And still love them despite their failings.Yet he has learned a little bit when grown up. During the book we meet Marnus again as a grown up man of 26, when he is fighting in the South African Army against rebels on Angolan soil. Everytime the inserts appear you see how the exepriences of being twarted and confused as a child have their repercussion in his adult reactions. And you can see how he is learning and growing, albeit it piecemeal and slowly. \"How come you are here as a soldier?\", he asks one of his soldiers. It feels that it is one of the first times he turns towards a person of an other colour and asks a direct question about their thoughts. The first time he is really interested. And than also the remorse breaks through, so big that dying seems a reasonable option out of this guilt. Not choosen, just like he was unable to steer his own course as a child, but submitting to fate."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "\"Memorable for the eye-opening authenticity with which Behr catches the Afrikaner mentality at home ... Behr's novel offers a disturbing confirmation that sincere and kindly people can still be the walking representation of evil\" (Sunday Times)Mark Behr's first time novel \"The Smell of Apples\" won the prestigious CNA Literary Debut Award and the Eugene Marais Prize. It was a wordlwide success, because it contains one of the most expelling themes in South Africa of the last 30 years.Behr tells the story through the eyes of the 11-year old Marnus Erasmus who lives with his sister and parents in Cape Town of 1973.Behr links many aspects throughout the story so that the reader gets to know about Marnus's story of initiation, the apartheid system, the sexual mischiefs of his parents and Marnus being a 26-year old soldier in the Angolan Civil War.But mainly the reader is led through the week of Marnus's life becoming more smart and grown up.He and his sister Ilse especially try to behave like adults when a Chilean general visits the family. This so called Mr.Smith has a symbolic function in the novel, because he is the one(the snake)who steels the apples out the families Garden of Eden.All in all the novel by Mark Behr is a good introduction for readers who want to inform theirselves and who are interested in the apartheid system and the life of blacks and whites in this period of time."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "In his novel \"The Smell of Apples\" Mark Behr deals with problems of Apartheid by telling the story of a white South-African boy called Marnus Erasmus.Throughout the book the strong relation to his father becomes obvious. Although Mr. Erasmus is really strict and authoritarian, Marnus regards him as a hero, especially because he is a general in the South African Army. Nevertheless the reader believes that Marnus's father is very considerate concerning his family, but this illusion gets destroyed when Marnus observes that his best friend Frikkie is raped.The end of the novel is really shocking, but exactly that makes the book so interesting and readable. Telling the story through the eyes of a 10-year old boy makes the story even more dramatic.I like the story and the characters, although the parts of the novel concerning Marnus's time in war are sometimes hard to understand"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "After Mark Behr's \"The Smell of Apples\" had earned best critics by famous newspapers like \"The Sunday Times\" or \"The Daily Telegraph\", I decided to get a personal impression of this book.Indeed the story seemed to be quite interesting from begin on: Behr describes a harmonious family. He writes with with a sense for details and creates a perfect illusion, in which the eleven year-old protagonist lives.This idyllic picture is first disturbed by the second time-level, which appears always suddenly without connection and ends the same way. Here Marnus is a 26 year-old soldier, who fights in Angola and finally dies.The contrast of these two levels makes the reader soonly mistrust the harmony of Marnus's life and his family.Little incidents engross this feeling time after time, although the really tragic end is very surprising anyway.Mark Behr succeeds in showingthe former or maybe still actual conflict between South African Blacks and Whitesby analyzing the Afrikaner-mentality in an apparently normal Afrikaner-family.The change of society (military) is told in a detailed and really understandable way. So you can experience the younger South African history by identifying with Marnus, who has to face bad things, but doesn't seem to learn from it anyway.For the interested reader a real duty!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Reading the very good critics Mark Behr had earned for his first novel \"The Smell of Apples\", I started reading the book with very high expectations. And I can say that they were fulfilled.The book contains two time levels: The first one deals with an 11-year old boy, Marnus Erasmus, growing up in South Africa in 1973. Behr gives a detailed look into the racist society and tells the story of a shocking rape at the same time.The second one takes place in Angola. Marnus fights 16 years later as a lieutnant of the Soth African army in the Angola- civilwar. He and his soldiers are cut off from the troops. Again Behr succeeds in describing the cruelty of war. He knows how to connect the two time levels without loosing the reader's attention.Finally I can say that it was worth reading."}]}, "authors": ["Mark Behr"], "isbn": "0312136048", "longitude":
