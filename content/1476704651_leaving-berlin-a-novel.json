Alex Meier, a renowned author has been caught up in the communist mania in the US and has been ousted from the country. But he makes a deal to work with the CIA and work as a spy in East Berlin. Immediately upon his arrival, the action starts. This is really an old-school, spy novel. Alex is a novice and quickly has to find out who he can trust and how much of his soul he is willing to part with to stay alive. The author brings the struggle in East Berlin to life...the struggle between the true believers in an East German socialist state, a final opportunity to move past the Nazis...but instead, they have gotten in bed with the Russians and are just starting to realize they may be the same, if not worse than what they had just gotten free of. I found this to be an engaging read, that kept me turning the pages...needing to know what was going to happen to Alex. I loved the end of the book...it was poignant and memorable.I received a copy of this title from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Fine"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A terrific read.

Almost four years after the war\u2019s end, the city is still in ruins, a physical wasteland and a political symbol about to rupture. In the West, a defiant, blockaded city is barely surviving on airlifted supplies; in the East, the heady early days of political reconstruction are being undermined by the murky compromises of the Cold War. Espionage, like the black market, is a fact of life. Even culture has become a battleground, with German intellectuals being lured back from exile to add credibility to the competing sectors.\r\n\r\nAlex Meier, a young Jewish writer, fled the Nazis for America before the war. But the politics of his youth have now put him in the crosshairs of the McCarthy witch-hunts. Faced with deportation and the loss of his family, he makes a desperate bargain with the fledgling CIA: he will earn his way back to America by acting as their agent in his native Berlin. But almost from the start things go fatally wrong. A kidnapping misfires, an East German agent is killed, and Alex finds himself a wanted man. Worse, he discovers his real assignment\u2014to spy on the woman he left behind, the only woman he has ever loved. Changing sides in Berlin is as easy as crossing a sector border. But where do we draw the lines of our moral boundaries? At betrayal? Survival? Murder?
