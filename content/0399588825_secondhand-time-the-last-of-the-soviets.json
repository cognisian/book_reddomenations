One of the best explorations of the collective late Soviet, post-Soviet psyche and experience, told through the individual stories of a wide array of real life Soviet/ex-Soviet citizens. Brutal, tender, honest, heartbreaking and hopeful. Alexievich is extraordinary writer, who has absolutely earned her Nobel Prize all over again."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Svetlana Alexievich's \"Secondhand Time: The Last of the Soviets\" left me unimpressed.  It was a long, discursive, repetitive, sometimes boring, transcription of talks with the last members of the Soviet generation in Russia.  It lacked any apparent effort at context and narrative framing by the author.  If a writer does nothing but regurgitate oral testimony, while it it may be informative and it may be unconventional, is it literature?  Not to me."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Literally a lens into people's hearts and souls.

I would be careful about reading this book and if you want a good understanding of recent history of Russia, there are better books. What is clear from the history of communism and socialism is that total state control of economies and societies virtually always leads to dictatorship. 39 countries have tried this and all of them either became dictatorships or were to begin with. The 8 social democratic countries, on the other hand, are always rated objectively as the best places in the world to live. When a government makes private economic activity illegal, that requires a police state to enforce it. A social democracy has a cooperative structure, government, business, unions, cooperatives that share power and decisions and support democracy. Russia is a prime example of what happens when all the wrong things are done.Midwest Independent Research, educational websites. Dictatorships, mwir-dictatorships.blogspot.

Everyday Russian citizens recount the past thirty years, showing us what life was like during the fall of the Soviet Union and what it\u2019s like to live in the new Russia left in its wake. Through interviews spanning 1991 to 2012, Alexievich takes us behind the propaganda and contrived media accounts, giving us a panoramic portrait of contemporary Russia and Russians who still carry memories of oppression, terror, famine, massacres\u2014but also of pride in their country, hope for the future, and a belief that everyone was working and fighting together to bring about a utopia.
