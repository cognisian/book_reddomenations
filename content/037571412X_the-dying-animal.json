Or vice-versa.\" I'll wager very few woman readers get past the first ten pages of The Dying Animal. Honestly, I almost tossed the book myself, being more or less post-erotic and easily bored by other people's lust. But I soldiered on. I'm not unhappy I did. It's a book to love and hate with equal fervor, because it's about a \"self\" that one must love and hate with open eyes. Roth is often taken as a paragon of self-adulation, and his character in this novel  -- a drama critic named David Krepesh -- anoints himself to be the ultimate evolutionary product of sexual liberation while simultaneously portraying himself as a hopeless victim of sexual obsession. Sex is life; sex is death.Alas, Roth's depiction of Krepesh as a hero/victim of the 60s jibes achingly with my own memory-image of myself in the throes of the \"sexual revolution.\" I despise Krepesh. I am Krepesh. (Or I was Krepesh then and would probably still be Krepesh today except for etc.) Yeah, the book is literary smut, but so is life. And then it turns out to be just what the title proclaims: a book about Death. With highly amusing interpolations and meanderings. It's just 150 pages. You might give it a shot."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Saw the movie \"Elegy\" and wanted to read the book.  Sensitive and an interesting exploration of aging, and the interplay between older man and your woman.

He's past the clever lengthy depictions of male desire and old age because it is now he who will be dead soon. Hence the recent novellas of less than 200 words. Time is running out and he's cutting to the chase, to the essence: \"On the nights she isn't with me, I am deformed\".

With these words our most unflaggingly energetic and morally serious novelist launches perhaps his fiercest book. \r\n\r\nThe speaker is David Kepesh, white-haired and over sixty, an eminent cultural critic and star lecturer at a New York college\u2013as well as an articulate propagandist of the sexual revolution. For years he has made a practice of sleeping with adventurous female students while maintaining an aesthete\u2019s critical distance. But now that distance has been annihilated. \r\n\r\nThe agency of Kepesh\u2019s undoing is Consuela Castillo, the decorous and humblingly beautiful 24-year-old daughter of Cuban exiles. When he becomes involved with her, Kepesh finds himself dragged\u2013helplessly, bitterly, furiously\u2013into the quagmire of sexual jealousy and loss. \r\n\r\nIn chronicling this descent, Philip Roth performs a breathtaking set of variations on the themes of eros and mortality, license and repression, selfishness and sacrifice. The Dying Animal is a burning coal of a book, filled with intellectual heat and not a little danger.", "asin": "037571412X", "rank": "139562", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41qXcqoJOqL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
