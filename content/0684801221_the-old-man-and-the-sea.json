I honestly do not care for it, and listening to people talk about fishing generally makes me want to fling myself into a sea full of frenzied sharks. That being said, The Old Man and the Sea is a beautiful story. Picking it up I read it straight through in one sitting, because I simply could not stop.

When ordering this edition, I thought I was getting a bargain, but I was in fact being taken!

Told in language of great simplicity and power, it is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal -- a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. \r\n\r\nHere Hemingway recasts, in strikingly contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph won from loss. Written in 1952, this hugely successful novella confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature.", "asin": "0684801221", "rank": "2093", "city": "Havana", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/411pakPjvdL.jpg", "country": "Cuba", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
