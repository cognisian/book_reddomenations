But two men\u2014John Chatterton and John Mattera\u2014are willing to risk everything to find the Golden Fleece, the ship of the infamous pirate Joseph Bannister. At large during the Golden Age of Piracy in the seventeenth century, Bannister should have been immortalized in the lore of the sea\u2014his exploits more notorious than Blackbeard\u2019s, more daring than Kidd\u2019s. But his story, and his ship, have been lost to time. If Chatterton and Mattera succeed, they will make history\u2014it will be just the second time ever that a pirate ship has been discovered and positively identified. Soon, however, they realize that cutting-edge technology and a willingness to lose everything aren\u2019t enough to track down Bannister\u2019s ship.
