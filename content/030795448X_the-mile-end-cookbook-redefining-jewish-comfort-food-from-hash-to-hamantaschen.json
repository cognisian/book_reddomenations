The Mile End Cookbook celebrates the craft of new Jewish cooking with more than 100 soul-satisfying recipes and gorgeous photographs. \r\n\r\nThroughout, the Bernamoffs share warm memories of cooking with their families and the traditions and holidays that inspire recipes like blintzes with seasonal fruit compote; chicken salad whose secret ingredient is fresh gribenes; veal schnitzel kicked up with pickled green tomatoes and preserved lemons; tsimis that\u2019s never mushy; and cinnamon buns made with challah dough. Noah and Rae also celebrate homemade delicatessen staples and share their recipes and methods for pickling, preserving, and smoking just about anything.\r\n\r\nFor every occasion, mood, and meal, these are recipes that any home cook can make, including:\r\n\r\nSMOKED AND CURED MEAT AND FISH: brisket, salami, turkey, lamb bacon, lox, mackerel\r\n\r\nPICKLES, GARNISHES, FILLINGS, AND CONDIMENTS: sour pickles, pickled fennel, horseradish cream, chicken con\ufb01t, sauerkraut, and soup mandel\r\n\r\nSUMPTUOUS SWEETS AND BREADS: rugelach, jelly-\ufb01lled doughnuts, \ufb02ourless chocolate cake, honey cake, cheesecake, challah, rye \r\n\r\nALL THE CLASSICS: the ultimate chicken soup, ge\ufb01lte \ufb01sh, corned beef sandwich, latkes, knishes\r\n\r\nWith tips and lore from Jewish and culinary mavens, such as Joan Nathan and Niki Russ Federman of Russ & Daughters, plus holiday menus, Jewish cooking has never been so inspiring.", "asin": "030795448X", "rank": "258006", "city": "Montreal", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51o67-vHCrL.jpg", "country": "Canada", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
