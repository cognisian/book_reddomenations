Roger Crowley - please write more history books!!!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "So often it's hard, especially in the time period in question and when dealing with conflicts involving major world religions, to find a book that is completely unbiased in it's reporting of the subject matter. This book and this author are the exception to that rule. That to begin with was what I enjoyed about this book. Mr. Crowley's position on the subject at hand is that of objective reporter of historical events. There is no personal or religious/Western bias of any kind (Not that I know anything of his personal beliefs) in this book or any sense that Mr. Crowley belongs to a \"side\" in the subject matter.As for the subject matter itself, the book starts as a general overview of the emergence of Islam, it's conquest of the Arab world and it's previous conflicts with the Byzantines. It then generally covers the Byzantines history in the area over the previous 400 years and the way thier policies and mutual interactions led up the events to be covered.The bulk of the book is a straight forward military history of the battle and the seige, covering historical documents as well as personal accounts of the battle from individuals who fought it. It covers the blood and guts details that you would expect to find in a medieval battle, detailing atrocieties committed with no attempt to whitewash or excuse, but also no attempt to judge from a modern perspective. All in all, one of the most enjoying and easy to read books I've read in some time."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "An excellent and objective account of the Ottoman siege and world-changing conquest of Constantinople, Well written, attention-grabbing, and a welcome addition to any collection of works on the Ottoman Empire and Byzantium.

The most glaring naming error in this book was when Crowley referred to the Maritime Republic of Ragusa (Republica Marittima Ragusana) as Dubrovnik.While Dubrovnik is indeed the modern name of Ragusa, in 1453 Ragusa was still ruled by an Italian elite that spoke a language that was quite similar to Venetian. Indeed, eventually Ragusa became part of the Republic of Venice along with most of Dalmatian coast line. In deed, to this day ethnic Italians can be found in Slovenia and Croatia and according to some historical accounts Marco Polo was actually born in Split.In the case of the names of people, Crowley often annoyingly uses the Anglicized version of the name, or in the case of Giustiniani, fails to provide the full name; Giovanni Giustiniani Longo. While these may seems like minor errors, I would tend to believe that an historian of the caliber of Crowley would not be prone to such mistakes. This is a great book but it could have been edited better."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "If you are interested in the fall of Constantanople and the end of the Roman empire, this book is an absolutely riveting read. The final battle of several months is detailed incredibly well. Specific events often are pinpointed to an exact hour on a specific day. One day starts in a city named Constantinople  with a battle raging through the night, and at about 8:00 am the next day that city is Istanbul.
