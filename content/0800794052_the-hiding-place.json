Jonathan Kis-Lev has done an outstanding job of connecting the reader with the characters. I have read books in the past based on true stories and books about the terrible events surrounding the Holocaust, but for me, this book captures such a feeling of being there in the moment and truly experiencing it like no other that I have read before.I loved how in the beginning of the book Kis-Lev takes the reader on a happy journey of getting to know these young ladies and their families. I got to see Maria and Helena start life so differently, but grow to love each other so much in spite of Maria being a Christian and Helena being a Jew. I loved spending holidays with their families and going to the beach and feeling that childlike excitement and fun.Then when it seemed that life couldn't get much better, the rug was ripped out from under me just as it was for these young ladies, and the war began. Oh my, I cried as poor Helena lost everything that she held dear. Her family was gone. Her home was gone. Now she was trapped in the ghetto and she was dying, not only physically, but also mentally, emotionally and spiritually as well. It so was hard for Maria to know that she was losing her one true friend. She had to do something before she lost Helena forever.Maria teaches us that true friendship requires complete sacrifice and laying down your own life for your friend. I learned so much from this book that I wasn't expecting to. Friendship isn't something to be taken lightly. It is real and it is valuable. My hats off to Jonathan Kis-Lev for capturing this beautiful true story and sharing it with us. This is the best book I have read in a very long time with its joys, its sorrows and ultimately...Hope."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Truth, conviction, the best and worst of humanity displayed.

It certainly is that but that is not what the book was really about. So is it a book about a heroic family that puts their lives and freedom on the line to save the lives of jews. Yes, that did happened but that is not what the book was about. Was it about the incredible strength and resilience to survive the concentration camps of Hitler's Germany? Yes, they did that but it was not about that either.  Was it about forgiveness? Or the work done to help those that had been imprisoned heal and get their lives back?  It was all of these and none of these. It was about Faith. The faith of one family. The kind of Faith that produces the rest of the story. It was their faith and their love of God that was at the heart of all they did, all they survived, all they accomplished.  Faith. Love. And dedication to God's will for their lives."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is the most inspirational book I have ever read.
