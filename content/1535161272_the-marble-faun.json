The Marble Faun, written on the eve of the American Civil War, is set in a fantastical Italy. The romance mixes elements of a fable, pastoral, gothic novel, and travel guide.\r\n\r\nThis romance focuses on four main characters: Miriam, Hilda, Kenyon, and Donatello.\r\n\r\nMiriam is a beautiful painter with an unknown past. Throughout the novel, she is compared to many other women including Eve, Beatrice Cenci, Judith, and Cleopatra. Miriam is pursued by a mysterious, threatening man who is her \u201cevil genius\u201d through life. Hilda is an innocent copyist. She is compared to the Virgin Mary and the white dove. Her simple, unbendable moral principles can make her severe in spite of her tender heart. Miriam and Hilda are often contrasted.\r\n\r\nKenyon is a sculptor who represents rationalist humanism. He cherishes a romantic affection towards Hilda. Donatello, the Count of Monte Beni, is often compared to Adam and is in love with Miriam. Donatello amazingly resembles the marble Faun of Praxiteles, and the novel plays with the characters\u2019 belief that the Count may be a descendant of the antique Faun. Hawthorne, however, withholds a definite statement even in the novel\u2019s concluding chapters and postscript.\r\n\r\nWikipedia", "asin": "1535161272", "rank": "7209798", "city": "Rome", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51XWfhbFlRL.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Oedipus", "Bad luck, followed by promise, ending in a\n                    final fall"]}
