He knows Paris block by block from the subterranean up and seems to tell all. I found myself underlining the names of restaurants described and other points of interest to visit (or avoid) but soon stopped because there were so many of note for so many different reasons. The author has crafted a brilliant book difficult to put down that no one else could have written.  My only quibble is that the book lacks an index."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This genius format took me from Napolean to literal Napoleans.

Such a fascinating trip through the history of eating in Paris! Well written, smart, inspired!Now I am waiting for the paperback to come out because I've yet to master the ability to revisit passages on Kindle that I want to research further.  And I can't wait to revisit the Mazarin Library to take a peek at some of those manuscripts myself."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "There is a lot of deep historical knowledge here but is served up in tasty bites that are easily digested.  For anyone interested in France, Paris, and food this is a great read.  Mr. Downie mentions a lot of sites that are still in existence and can be visited so the book can also be used as a guide to travel.  Along with his other Paris titles, this is a book for anyone planning on visiting and who wants more than a one paragraph explanation provided by most travel information.  Just get it!!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Whether or not you know Paris, BUY this book. It's a guaranteed voyage of discovery by an author who knows Paris inside out and generously shares its secrets - culinary or otherwise - with his readers. And by the by, this is by no means an easy subject to tackle - Paris and its love affair with food - because you are bound to offend someone somewhere who does not agree with what you write. A love for food is a very subjective one and all good food writers are going to project their own tastes and enthusiasms into their writing about a place, a dish and the history behind it. It is my conviction that David Downie does this admirably in A Taste of Paris. He pulls off a difficult task - engaging the reader with some serious history about Paris, the genesis of its food, his own thoughts and insights - with erudition and a light touch which is both enchanting, informative and interesting. In short, A Taste of Paris is excellent and a damn good read. It has all the necessary \"ingredients\" to be a winner and is an absolute must for history and food lovers alike."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This is a book that pulls you right into the French way of life and France's love affair with food.

Bravo, David Downie!"}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "I 'm very sorry to say it, but I found this to be one of the most irritating, least worthwhile, books I have read in a long time.The title is seriously misleading\u2014\u201cA Taste\u201d must refer to the author\u2019s, because that is the main theme of the text. Though there are many references to historical documents, places and events, they are not connected by a coherent historical narrative in which one subject leads to another. The claim of \u201cthe Parisian Love Affair with Food\u201d is never addressed, much less demonstrated, and as for even the author\u2019s \u201clove\u201d of \u201cfood\u201d, there is no evidence here of a refined palate or much culinary knowledge on his part. Many names are dropped, but often this seems to be showing off, marketing his walking-tour business rather than teaching readers; street maps would have helped.  The strongest takeaway as the central thread for me was the author\u2019s apparent fascination with himself\u2014his constant padding of the text with often gratuitous insertions of his personal takes on everything (as if that is what readers care most about), instead of simply presenting an objective history in which we are interested, for which we were misled to buy the book.The prose style is breezy, smart-alecky, over-written and purportedly facetious\u2014more suitable to short, light magazine articles than to nonfiction books. Servers in restaurants are many times described as dressed like penguins, as if that (clich\u00e9, after all) were\u2014what? Witty? Clever? Funny? Certainly none of those from the second time on. Unremitting and purportedly clever word-plays draw more attention to the writing than to the subjects at hand. I found no depth of insight or nuanced sensibility.Actually the pretext of a \u201chistory\u201d and \u201cthe Parisian Love of Food\u201d are misconceived. Because so little is known about the early history of Paris, the text focuses on the author almost entirely\u2014e.g., the solid historical information in the first 24 pages of the book (after which I stopped counting) could easily have been fitted into two paragraphs. Charlemagne is adduced as if somehow representative of Paris, whereas he was born in either Belgium or Germany, and lived all over Europe wherever he was (almost always) fighting, keeping his court at Aachen, in today\u2019s Germany. The history of Paris is of course familiar from many other sources, but this book contains no illuminating attempt to create a specialized narrative fitting into that history."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Love the ring. Excellant better than I imagined.  Havent started the book but it arrived in excellant condition."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "\u201cIf I flipped a franc, it would land on something worth swallowing,\u201d David Downie writes of his arrival in Paris in 1976. He remembers, as I do, gazing into the yawning seven-story hole where Les Halles had provided food and drink to all Paris until its relocation to suburban Rungis several years before, and he laments much more strongly than I do the second replacement for the historic Baltard canopies, the massive skate wing that covers the new and very chic shopping center. Les Halles has come a long way, from Zola\u2019s Belly of Paris to yet another pricey and upmarket shopping center.Downie\u2019s newest book, A Taste of Paris, is the third in his recent series of memoirs/explorations of Paris. Beginning with Paris, Paris: Journey into the City of Light (2011) and continuing with A Passion for Paris: Romanticism and Romance in the City of Light (2016), the series explores his fascination with his home city. I still think Paris, Paris is the best guidebook I\u2019ve read, and it\u2019s not really a guidebook but a slow, guided introduction to fascinating aspects of the city. A two dozen peeks through a two dozen keyholes, which together add up to a rounded view.The list of Downie\u2019s books is long. There are more than a dozen on it. I haven\u2019t read all of them but I\u2019ve read and enjoyed a good sample, and many of them have food at their center. Or wine. Or food and wine.Unless you are a serious student of French culinary history \u2014 enrolled at one of the big cooking academies, for example \u2014 I suggest you approach A Taste of Paris the way you\u2019d approach a historical novel. It is nicely written, in Downie\u2019s own idiosyncratic style, and full of facts and sidelights about the historical personalities, including the three King Louis <sup>(see links below)</sup> whose reigns led up to the Revolution. It\u2019s entertaining.As you get into it you\u2019ll appreciate more the sheer depth of Downie\u2019s knowledge about Paris, France, food, and any combination of the three. I still remember reading his Food Wine Burgundy and thinking it contained more information per square inch than anything I\u2019d read. A Taste of Paris comes close.Readers of this blog know that Paris is my favorite city, and that I spend a lot of time there researching and writing my novels. One of Downie\u2019s sidelines is as a tour guide, and a few years ago my sister, visiting with friends from Texas, asked him to guide her group, and invited me to tag along. It was an impressive experience. Downie\u2019s knowledge of the city\u2019s history is precise and seems bottomless.The part of A Taste of Paris I enjoyed most was Downie\u2019s discussion of more recent years, such as the story of Les Halles. I remember with pleasure the midnight dinner of pigeon Jan and I shared with the financial editor of the International Herald Tribune and his wife in the early seventies, when we were freelancing in Frankfurt and writing business and financial stories in the German-speaking countries. Les Halles as Zola described it almost exactly a hundred years before, down to the rich onion soup that made up an obligatory part of every meal.I\u2019ve enjoyed meals at restaurants he mentions, many of them, and bought a peppermill at E. Dehillerin, which he calls \u201cthe most famous and labyrinthine of several kitchen supply emporiums\u201d in the area. It\u2019s like your grandfather\u2019s hardware store.And I\u2019ve also visited and recommend the famous sculpture by Raymond Mason, in a side chapel of the imposing Saint-Eustache church which looks over Les Halls. In modern style, it depicts vendors when they left Les Halles for the last time in 1969. It\u2019s colorful and atmospheric."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It was not by accident that Paris became the world capital of gastronomy. But -- how did it happen?
