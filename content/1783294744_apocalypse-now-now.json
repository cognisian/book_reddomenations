This has to be one of my favorites!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "So I read it during a deployment, getting caught up in the flashy cover and the clever little title, then I dumped it when I headed back to the states. During a book store prowling, I found it and decided to pick it back up.It's interesting to say the least. There were some mistakes, one I noticed was the name change of the bird from Tony to Toni. His name is only mentioned like three or four times and one of those four times it becomes a Toni bird. Bird didn't matter too much, I'm surprised I even picked up on it. A couple other smaller things, missing paragraph break for one dialogue bit, a time our MC Baxter sits twice, and a little peeve of mine of an overuse of dialogue tags when they aren't necessary. Those are just small things.The story itself is all right. Definitely an enjoyable and creative read of a world packed with a lot of stuff. That might've been a drawback, all the package THINGS condensed into the novel. A lot, at time it seemed some of the creatures were tossed in just to make the novel more different. Most of the secondary characters lacked much growth outside our Rowan and Baxter. Many were introduced so quickly I stopped caring for who they were. The events that happened also just seemed to happen. It moved quickly. One event after another. Little pause between everything, during which we usually gained a couple more fodder characters to kill off.The connection, time warp deal was neatly done, but some of the other  twists I could see  because in a novel of so much chaos, there was actually a fine line of sanity connecting the pieces. It was easy to see a lot of things falling into place and knowing ahead of time the truth before we were given it.I would recommend it, it's not a bad story by any means."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "A fun read about bad kid Baxter who gets caught up in supernatural goings on.  Really liked the writing style & black humour."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Baxter is in trouble. He needs to save his girlfriend and decide to either protect the world or rule it, but he is just an ordinary teen in South Africa-- if ordinary means being the leader of a rapidly growing porn ring at school and discovering you might be both a serial killer and powerful warrior seer hero in an underworld filled with mythical creatures and zombie spider prostitutes. Will his life ever be normal?Some say this book is \u201c\u2026Neil Gaiman meets Tarantino,\u201d and I agree-- only I would add a bit of Rowling too. Outside of that, Charlie Human is a force of imagination that can hold his own.It is a clever, cringe-inspiring tale, filled with characters and settings that burn their weird supernatural personalities into the brain.A raw, darkly funny romp through old genre territory made new again. I thoroughly enjoyed it.Follow it up with the second book in the series, \u201cKill Baxter.\u201dThis review and more at annevolmering.com."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "I wasnt able to finish the book because of how unsympatetic the main protagonist is.Have you ever met a guy at a party that keeps talking about how great he is, how much money he makes, his workout regiment and how interesting his life is? once you leave the party you're like \"wow that guy is a douchebag, I hope I never have to hear about him ever again\"Why am I supposed to root for this guy? He repeatedly beats on his mentally challenged brother for no reason, decides to ignore one of his friends for not being popular enough and his girlfriend is just a random hot girl that he bangs because she's hot...I kept thinking \"well at some point that guy's gonna redeem himself and it'll be worth it\" but it took too long and I decided to read a better book."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I liked it.

If you dig Jim Butcher or Simon Green you'll enjoy this.  The prequel was good as well."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "It took a few pages for this story to get in gear. When it did I very much enjoyed it. It has a very original universe and mythology that is enriched by South African history - at least as far as I can tell, knowing next to nothing about South African history that doesn't include Nelson Mandella. I enjoyed the main character, who has a \"Catcher In The Rye\" kind of vibe, but in a much more fun and humorous way.The supporting characters are also unique and enjoyable.Is this a \"perfect book\"? No. But it is a \"perfectly enjoyable book\" with an enjoyable story that kept surprising me and fun characters. I kept wanting to pick it up when I had other things to do, and THAT is my signal for a 5 star book."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Starts odd...but gets great!
