I've become a Chris McKinney fan and have bought several titles for future reads.  Started with my friend lending me \"Bolohead Row\"!  I can relate to the characters as well, as have either experienced similar situations or know people that are almost like the characters that he depicts!  A fast and easy read!"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very good"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I've read this book over 20 times. We use it in a classroom to teach students how choices you make can have a serious impact on your life. Recommended only for high school and up, some graphic details, and lots of swearing.

He\u2019s tough looking, a hard case, observes his cellmate Cal\u2014the mute tattoo artist of the prison, a wife murderer. SYN, a gang symbol, is tattooed on his hand, and he has a Japanese emblem inscribed on his left shoulder. He asks Cal for a tattoo on his back, in kanji script, of Musashi\u2019s Book of the Void. \r\n\r\n\"Rough-and-tumble, rife with fully drawn badass characters and plenty of action, McKinney's novel is powerful and strong.\" Time Out Chicago\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile he is being worked on, he tells Cal his life story, a tale of hardship and abuse. Motherless, he was raised by a distant father, a Vietnam War veteran, in the impoverished hinterlands. In his teen years he hung out with the native Hawaiian gangs and was drawn into the Hawaiian-Korean underworld of strip bars and massage parlors. His ambition and proud samurai spirit seem, inevitably, to lead to his downfall. \r\n\r\nChris McKinney is of Korean, Japanese, and Scottish descent. He was born in Honolulu and grew up in Kahaluu. He portrays the native Hawaiian experience from the inside, where children of mixed ethnicity grow up far from the clear water and pristine beaches of the rich visitors\u2019 resorts.", "asin": "1566473195", "rank": "481436", "city": "Honolulu", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51tKBAoxCvL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
