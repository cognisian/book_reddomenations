Left me wanting to read more about what happened next. Living through this from an American lens, married to a soldier who'd been forced to serve, it was fascinating to learn this family's side.

I am about the author's age, so it was fascinating to contrast his life of living the war in vietnam with my life of \"watching\" it on television or seeing photos in Life magazine.  Even though I was just a back seat observer to the horrors of that war, it is imprinted in my psyche.  It was surprising to me how emotional I felt for the people of Vietnam.  It felt like our tragedy, even though I didn't live it.  My history of the war was sketchy, and this book incented me to go back and study up.  I also saw the author on Anthony Bourdain's Vietnam segment.  Both the book and Bourdain's show have ignited a burning desire to visit Vietnam."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "i heard about this book  abd writer from anthony bourdain in vietnam. the book is very well written, evoked a lot of emotions, and raised a lot of questions, which i raiised with vietnamese friends. this invited discussions that gtratly broadened my understanding."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I recommend this book highly!

Then the Viet Cong launched their Tet offensive, and the Nguyen family\u2019s comfortable life was destroyed. The author\u2019s father was taken prisoner and marched up the Ho Chi Minh Trail.\r\n\r\nNorth Vietnam's highest-ranking civilian prisoner, he eventually spent twelve years in captivity, composing poems in his head to maintain his sanity. Nguyen himself escaped from Saigon as North Vietnamese tanks approached in 1975. He came of age as an American teenager, going to school dances and working at a Roy Rogers restaurant, yet yearning for the homeland and parents he had to leave behind. The author\u2019s mother stayed in Vietnam to look after her mentally ill daughter. She endured poverty and \u201creeducation\u201d until her husband was freed and the Nguyens could reunite.\r\n\r\nIntertwining these three stories, Where the Ashes Are shows us the Vietnam War through a child\u2019s eyes, privation after a Communist takeover, and the struggle of new immigrants.\r\n\r\nThe author, who returned to Vietnam as an American reporter, provides a detailed portrait of the nation as it opened to the West in the early 1990s. Where the Ashes Are closes with Nguyen\u2019s thoughts on being pulled between his adopted country and his homeland.", "asin": "0803226985", "rank": "483532", "city": "Ho Chi Minh City", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51quZM%2BHcSL.jpg", "country": "Hanoi", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
