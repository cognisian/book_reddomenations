The only reason I finished it was because I liked the writing style. I had a lot of difficulty to connect and like the main character. In fact, I was even glad he was so miserable: he really deserved it!The plot is quite blurry, timelines are nowhere to be seen. For instance, I had hard time understanding how old the main protagonist where, how long did it take from the event X to the event Y. I wish the book was shorter and better structured. But hey, Naipaul won Nobel prize for something!"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Interesting perspective but drags on quite a bit.

It is not exactly easy to read, many times I caught myself hating the characters other times cheering for them, then they disappoint me somehow, etc... The book presents so many perspectives, so many characters, that it is impossible to not develop empathy for each of them. Regarding the story itself, there are parts where many things happen, while in others it seems like a long waiting, just like life. I am a fan of the author and this was the harder book to read.

S. Naipaul\u2019s brilliant career, A House for Mr. Biswas is an unforgettable story inspired by Naipaul's father that has been hailed as one of the twentieth century's finest novels.\r\n\r\nIn his forty-six short years, Mr. Mohun Biswas has been fighting against destiny to achieve some semblance of independence, only to face a lifetime of calamity. Shuttled from one residence to another after the drowning death of his father, for which he is inadvertently responsible, Mr. Biswas yearns for a place he can call home. But when he marries into the domineering Tulsi family on whom he indignantly becomes dependent, Mr. Biswas embarks on an arduous\u2013and endless\u2013struggle to weaken their hold over him and purchase a house of his own. \r\n\r\nA heartrending, dark comedy of manners, A House for Mr. Biswas masterfully evokes a man\u2019s quest for autonomy against an emblematic post-colonial canvas.\r\n\r\n\"Naipaul has constructed a marvelous prose epic that matches the best nineteenth-century novels for richness of comic insight and final, tragic power.\" Newsweek\r\n\r\n", "asin": "0375707166", "rank": "87403", "city": "Trinidad and Tobago", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51rWrNovdOL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
