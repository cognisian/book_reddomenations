Half of the buildings are destroyed, including mosques. Some structures are simply fronts of buildings; business is conducted in pieces of buildings.The brutality of the social and political conditions parallels the physical desolation. The Taliban regime has banned \u201cpleasure.\u201d There can be no music. As if the war did not do enough damage, they destroy historic monuments. You can be clubbed for laughing on the street; passersby are whipped into prayers in the mosques. You look around every corner before speaking.Order is maintained with whips, fists and clubs. Public executions are a weekly occurrence. There are hangings, stonings of women, rifle executions, throat slittings. Sometime relatives of the victim conduct the execution. A mentally ill man who wanders the streets talking to himself is whipped to death for blasphemy. Women can only go out in public in full burka (\u201cthe swallows\u201d) and accompanied by a man.The toll of years of war is seen in the population. There are widows, war wounded, orphans. Men who lost arms and legs in the war beg from wheelbarrows. Parents have lost children. Kids roam the streets like packs of dogs, begging, feeding on garbage and stealing food. Important men carry a whip on the street to lash their way through the rabble.The story focuses on two married couples who aren\u2019t connected to each other. One man is the jailer to those being held for execution. In a way, he is a simple man who loves his wife. But he can\u2019t help himself from tormenting her even though she is dying. Seeing him depressed, his only friend tells him, in effect \u201cDivorce her; she\u2019s only a woman; get another one.\u201dA college-educated man and woman form the other couple. They were well-off before the Taliban but his family fell out of favor for political reasons. Now they live by selling off their furniture. She was a progressive woman who supported women\u2019s rights. Now she is home in a burka and she hates men for it. Her husband admits to her that, carried away by the frenzy of the mob, he helped stone a woman. After she and her husband are whipped for laughing on the streets, she transfers her hatred for the regime to her husband, realizing these are MEN who have created this absurd situation.The two families interact finally at the end in a creative but implausible ending.The author is a pen name for an Algerian army officer who used a feminine name to by-pass submitting his book to review and censorship while in the military. His real name, used on later books, is Mohammed Moulessehoul.

Intersecting their world is Atiq, a prison keeper, a man who has sincerely adopted the Taliban ideology and struggles to keep his faith, and his wife, Musarrat, who once rescued Atiq and is now dying of sickness and despair. \r\n\r\nDesperate, exhausted Mohsen wanders through Kabul when he is surrounded by a crowd about to stone an adulterous woman. Numbed by the hysterical atmosphere and drawn into their rage, he too throws stones at the face of the condemned woman buried up to her waist. With this gesture the lives of all four protagonists move toward their destinies.\r\nThe Swallows of Kabul is a dazzling novel written with compassion and exquisite detail by one of the most lucid writers about the mentality of Islamic fundamentalists and the complexities of the Muslim world. \r\n\r\nYasmina Khadra brings readers into the hot, dusty streets of Kabul and offers them an unflinching but compassionate insight into a society that violence and hypocrisy have brought to the edge of despair.", "asin": "1400033764", "rank": "384041", "city": "Kabul", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RmM9fV26L.jpg", "country": "Afghanistan", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
