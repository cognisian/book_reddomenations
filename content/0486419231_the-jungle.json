I had to read this in high school, but I wasn't mature or studious enough to understand the significance, even though my grandparents were all immigrants.  The world of slaughterhouses hasn't changed much in the past 100 years, poverty, and children working to support their family.  Both of my parents had to quit school to support their families or starve.

Too depressing, disgusting and cruel- to the people and the animals. Not sure how this got on my wishlist.

It quickly became a bestseller, arousing public sentiment and resulting in such federal legislation as the Pure Food and Drug Act.\r\n\r\nThe brutally grim story of a Slavic family who emigrates to America, The Jungle tells of their rapid and inexorable descent into numbing poverty, moral degradation, and social and economic despair. Vulnerable and isolated, the family of Jurgis Rudkus struggles \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to survive in an urban jungle.\r\n\r\nA powerful view of turn-of-the-century poverty, graft, and corruption, this fiercely realistic American classic is still required reading in many history and literature classes. It will continue to haunt readers long after they've finished the last page.", "asin": "0486419231", "rank": "8984", "city": "Chicago", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51a%2B1QusHHL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Icarus", "Opens with good fortunes, but doomed to fail"]}
