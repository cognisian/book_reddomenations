And where some Whites see their country's failings and are trying to do better, while others hang on to power, albeit increasingly fearfully.A poor country parson travels to Johannesberg to fech home his ailing sister. While there he tries to find his son, who moved to the city but has lost touch. What he finds is far worse than he could have expected...This novel really works because the characters are all so plausible. Such a story could easily 'take the side' of one race or the other: the 'Natives', oppressed, longsuffering - or violent, immoral. The Whites - cruel, racist - or victims . In actual fact, we see the flaws - and good side; and difficulties - of each. There are no easy answers, though it finishes on a hopeful note.Beautifully written."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Heartbreaking, partly because of the glimmer of hope during that time and the great disappointment of what came shortly after (with the institution of apartheid)."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "good book"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Incredibly moving story plus unique narrative style."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Although this book is known for its poetic prose, this was not what finally hooked me.

Alan Paton\u2019s impassioned novel about a black man\u2019s country under white man\u2019s law is a work of searing beauty.\r\n\r\nCry, the beloved country, for the unborn child that is the inheritor of our fear. Let him not love the earth too deeply. Let him not laugh too gladly when the water runs through his fingers, nor stand too silent when the setting sun makes red the veld with fire. Let him not be too moved when the birds of his land are singing, nor give too much of his heart to a mountain or valley. For fear will rob him of all if he gives too much.\r\n\r\nThe eminent literary critic Lewis Gannett wrote, \u201cWe have had many novels from statesmen and reformers, almost all bad; many novels from poets, almost all thin. In Alan Paton\u2019s Cry, the Beloved Country the statesman, the poet and the novelist meet in a unique harmony.\u201d\r\n\r\nCry, the Beloved Country is the deeply moving story of the Zulu pastor Stephen Kumalo and his son, Absalom, set against the background of a land and a people riven by racial injustice. Remarkable for its lyricism, unforgettable for character and incident, Cry, the Beloved Country is a classic work of love and hope, courage and endurance, born of the dignity of man.", "asin": "0743262174", "rank": "16388", "city": "Johannesburg", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51iV%2B9ssK9L.jpg", "country": "RSA", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
