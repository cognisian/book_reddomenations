It's a story that's compelling yet familiar.  Aldo leaves his wife and two children for a much younger woman.  At home, Vanda, the wife he left, begins to fall apart but, eventually manages to pick up the pieces and move on.The story is more of a novella, approximately, 150 pages but, it packs a punch.  The writing is excellent: the story of a fractured family told in parts, and, how a destructive relationship affected each of them. First we hear Vanda's POV after Aldo leaves her, then Aldo's POV, many years later and the the POV of the two children (now adults).The story reminded my of Elena Ferrante's Days of Abandonment, and, I later read that this author is Ferrante's (AKA Anita Raja) husband. Powerful themes, love, betrayal and guilt and, a wonderful intro and translation from the Italian by author Jhumpa Lahari."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Amazing book.

Would not recommend it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "The up-close life of a couple from her point of view, then his, then their children as adults. Strong on pacing, character exposition, and psychological depth.This accomplished Italian novelist is here translated into English by a favorite American writer, Jhumpa Lahiri. The result was compelling, insightful and moving."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "If you think there\u2019s nothing new to read in a novel about marriage and family, you should read Domenico Starnone\u2019s novel titled, Ties. Translated by Jhumpa Lahiri, this novel draws readers into the long marriage of Vanda and Aldo, at two critical times. Twelve years after their 1962 marriage, following the birth of two children, Aldo has an affair with Lidia and leaves Vanda for eight years. Starnone opens the novel with Vanda\u2019s reaction to this betrayal. A large middle section picks up decades later following their reconciliation, and the end of the novel features the couple\u2019s middle-aged children and the impact of the long-ago separation on their lives. I can\u2019t comment on the prose in the original Italian, but Lahiri\u2019s English translation was finely written and I enjoyed every page of this novel.Rating: Five-star (I love it)"}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I read Days of Abandonment by Elena Ferrante first and was bowled over by her painfully honest first person narrator's reaction to being left by her husband. In the course of recommending it to a friend, she told me that her husband had preferred Ties, so I had to read this book. I recommend that you read both. They're both by Italian writers and when read in tandem, reveal stark gender differences. Ties is from the point of view of first the wife then the husband. The wife suffers by comparison to Ferrante's \u2014in the long letter to her husband contained in Book One, she exists by turns apologetic or hysterical \u2014 but the husband is much more interesting, though I disliked his self-obsession and dishonest decisions almost to the point where I quit reading. What happens is depressing and threatening to their children's well-being, with both descending into their worst selves. What saved the story for me was the ending, Book Three, which is from the now adult children's point of view. The twist is a laugh out loud and makes the parents a bit more sympathetic, so in the end, I do recommend this short, well written book."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This depressing book may describe many people\u2019s lives. After twelve years of marriage, a man falls in love with another woman (whom we hardly see or get to know) and leaves his wife and young children for her. However, he returns to the family when the children are in their early teens and suffers from there on an unfulfilled and inadequate life. I say \u2018man\u2019 because although it is told in the first person, I gained no sense of who he was, nor why he returned. We view it all from a distance as if at arm\u2019s length - we never get close. The best thing is, it is 144 pages long so could fill a long train journey.Freak Out! My Life with Frank Zappa"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I heard about this via word of mouth, and then when I looked it up, was surprised I'd missed the review coverage. Maybe the review coverage is riding on the Ferrante coat-tails a bit, but either way this is a slim volume that you can read in one sitting, and yet makes quite an impression. It's not loud or splashy, more like a quiet, forceful monologue from mostly just one character, who is more intriguing than likable. The 'mystery' we're chasing is fairly nominal, and yet I found it absolutely page-turning. There is an intensity of character that just makes you want to stay immersed."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This short book is very interesting and insightful.  Those who judge family life in the light of Ossie and Harriet and their ilk will not be impressed, but those who who have not been as fortunate as the Nelson family in connubial bliss will find this book authentic and distressingly familiar.  The ending will throw most for a loop as it does go somewhat past the bell curve of the normal and the near normal.Starnone has many truthful things to say about affairs and their consequences, about vengeance and the attempt to reestablish relationships and the affect of such unhappy unions on children. Like a lot of contemporary European fiction, the portrait is stark and minimal, but not so acerbic as to be off putting.  Starnone still is able to construct some interesting characters very economically.An interesting sidelight of this edition is the lengthy introduction by the formerly Indo-American, now Italian author Jhumpa Lahiri.  It is going to be interesting to assign her a place in literary histor,y when the dust settles."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Didn't read it, It was downloaded for my wife, who did.  \"It left me with an unpleasant feeling\"  She simply did not like the story nor did she find anything \"redeeming\" in the narrative.

The rupture in Vanda and Aldo's marriage lies years in the past, but if one looks closely enough, the fissures and fault lines are evident. Their marriage is a cracked vase that may shatter at the slightest touch. Or perhaps it has already shattered, and nobody is willing to acknowledge the fact. \r\n\r\nDomenico Starnone's thirteenth work of fiction is a powerful short novel about relationships, family, love, and the ineluctable consequences of one's actions.
