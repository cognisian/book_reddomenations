This is a terrific book, thoroughly researched  and written with sharp, vivid journalistic language (i.e., not dry). It's a page turner, with lots to say about nature, history and politics.

Now it is revered as a national treasure, and Americans have launched the largest environmental project in history to try to save it.\r\n\r\nThe Swamp is the stunning story of the destruction and possible resurrection of the Everglades, the saga of man's abuse of nature in southern Florida and his unprecedented efforts to make amends. Michael Grunwald, a prize-winning national reporter for The Washington Post, takes readers on a riveting journey from the Ice Ages to the present, illuminating the natural, social and political history of one of America's most beguiling but least understood patches of land.\r\n\r\nThe Everglades was America's last frontier, a wild country long after the West was won. Grunwald chronicles how a series of visionaries tried to drain and \u201creclaim\u201d it, and how Mother Nature refused to bend to their will; in the most harrowing tale, a 1928 hurricane drowned 2,500 people in the Everglades. But the Army Corps of Engineers finally tamed the beast with levees and canals, converting half the Everglades into sprawling suburbs and sugar plantations. And though the southern Everglades was preserved as a national park, it soon deteriorated into an ecological mess. The River of Grass stopped flowing, and 90 percent of its wading birds vanished.\r\n\r\nNow America wants its swamp back. Grunwald shows how a new breed of visionaries transformed Everglades politics, producing the $8 billion rescue plan. That plan is already the blueprint for a new worldwide era of ecosystem restoration. And this book is a cautionary tale for that era. Through gripping narrative and dogged reporting, Grunwald shows how the Everglades is still threatened by the same hubris, greed and well-intentioned folly that led to its decline.", "asin": "0743251075", "rank": "46702", "city": "Miami", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ktuzJvlPL.jpg", "country": "United States of America", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
