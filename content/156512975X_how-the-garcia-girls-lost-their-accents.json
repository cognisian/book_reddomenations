Selected as a Notable Book by both the New York Times and the American Library Association, it won the PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Award for books with a multicultural perspective and was chosen by New York librarians as one of twenty-one classics for the twenty-first century. Ms. Alvarez was recently honored with the 2013 National Medal of Arts for her extraordinary storytelling. \r\n\r\nIn this debut novel, the Garc\u00eda sisters\u2014Carla, Sandra, Yolanda, and Sof\u00eda\u2014and their family must flee their home in the Dominican Republic after their father\u2019s role in an attempt to overthrow a tyrannical dictator is discovered. They arrive in New York City in 1960 to a life far removed from their existence in the Caribbean. In the wild and wondrous and not always welcoming U.S.A., their parents try to hold on to their old ways, but the girls try find new lives: by forgetting their Spanish, by straightening their hair and wearing fringed bell bottoms. For them, it is at once liberating and excruciating to be caught between the old world and the new. How the Garc\u00eda Girls Lost Their Accents sets the sisters free to tell their most intimate stories about how they came to be at home\u2014and not at home\u2014in America.", "asin": "156512975X", "rank": "31744", "city": "New York", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51FSQ1Sdu9L.jpg", "country": "Santo Domingo", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
