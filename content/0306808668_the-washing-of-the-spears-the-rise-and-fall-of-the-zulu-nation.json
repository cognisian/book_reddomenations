The author wrote a concise and studied history of the major tribe in Southern Africa.

It is severely racist and poorly written. Only pseudo-intellectuals would protest otherwise. What I found interesting about the ex-CIA agent\u2019s book is its focus on the sexuality of Shaka. Don Morris made a great effort to project the idea that Shaka Zulu was a latent homosexual, yes! He expresses this idea several times in this horrible book.From that point on, I stopped reading.Objective this book is not. It is created by racist to create a false history of African people in the southern portion of Africa.Finally, do not be fooled by the Buthelezi forward since he is a known traitor propped up by the racist apartheid regime that is still in economic power in southern Africa.I recommend African people read\u201d Emperor Shaka the Great: A Zulu Epic (UNESCO Collection of Representative Works African Authors Series)\u201d by Mazisi Kunene.As for this book it will either be resold or place in the garbage where it belongs."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Bought this edition to re-read an excellent history of rise and fall of Zulus; had given my first copy away so a friend could enjoy it."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "The attention to detail in this book is beyond what is required for an understanding of South African history, unless you are a scholar.  You will spend hundreds of tiny-type pages bogged down in minute details that really don't matter.  Read \"The Covenant\" by James Michener if you want to understand South Africa."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent narrative of the period.  Donald Morris created a detailed account of the actions and the personalities in what must have seemed an impenetrable era.  Though daunting for its size and small print the accounts move along at a good pace and pieces of the puzzles all fall into place."}]}, "authors": ["Donald R.
