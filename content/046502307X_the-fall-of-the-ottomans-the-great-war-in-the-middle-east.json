Only six generic maps in the beginning of the book, without forces involved, positions and movements. Just writings and writing including two Balkan wars. A despicable genocide of up to 1.5 million Armenians by Turks was not  condemned enough by Mr. Rogan. However, the author mentioned and cited from the book by G. Balakian: Armenian Golgotha presenting also the Armenian point of view.  The Turks still deny the facts of genocide committed and will not acknowledge their responsibility. There are no maps indicating fights against British and French throughout Mesopotamia, battles for Gaza including first two losses by Britain and, finally the win in the third, decisive battle, where the Ottomans run away from British and Anzac cavalry. The  famous role of T. E. Lawrence helping Faysal of Arabia  was documented as well as the liberation of Jerusalem by Gen. Allenby, battles and losses to Russia in Anatolia under Gen. Yudenitch;  all these battles need charts for clarifications! The Turkish provinces in eastern Anatolia were a gateway to Persia and Central Asia, where Russia and Britain  were hooked in an intense rivalry for predominant that came to be known as the GREAT GAME!

But in the aftermath of the assassination in Sarajevo, the powers of Europe were sliding inexorably toward war, and not even the Middle East could escape the vast and enduring consequences of one of the most destructive conflicts in human history. The Great War spelled the end of the Ottomans, unleashing powerful forces that would forever change the face of the Middle East.\r\n\r\nIn The Fall of the Ottomans, award-winning historian Eugene Rogan brings the First World War and its immediate aftermath in the Middle East to vivid life, uncovering the often ignored story of the region\u2019s crucial role in the conflict. Bolstered by German money, arms, and military advisors, the Ottomans took on the Russian, British, and French forces, and tried to provoke Jihad against the Allies in their Muslim colonies. Unlike the static killing fields of the Western Front, the war in the Middle East was fast-moving and unpredictable, with the Turks inflicting decisive defeats on the Entente in Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, and Gaza before the tide of battle turned in the Allies\u2019 favor. The great cities of Baghdad, Jerusalem, and, finally, Damascus fell to invading armies before the Ottomans agreed to an armistice in 1918.\r\n\r\nThe postwar settlement led to the partition of Ottoman lands between the victorious powers and laid the groundwork for the ongoing conflicts that continue to plague the modern Arab world. A sweeping narrative of battles and political intrigue from Gallipoli to Arabia, The Fall of the Ottomans is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the Great War and the making of the modern Middle East.\r\n\r\n\u201cRogan offers an intricately worked but very readable account of a theocracy\u2019s demise.\u201d New York Times Editors' Choice", "asin": "046502307X", "rank": "53749", "city": "Istanbul", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51zDSrALTHL.jpg", "country": "Turkey", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
