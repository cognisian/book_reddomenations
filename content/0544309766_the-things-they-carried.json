That\u2019s not a criticism. In fact, it\u2019s part of the brilliance of this book. If it were thoroughly plotted, it might not feel so authentic. As war is disjointed, so is O\u2019Brien\u2019s book. Some of the chapters are tiny and some are lengthy. Some read more like essays than fiction, and others are clearly fictitious.When I say that \u201csome are clearly fictitious,\u201d there\u2019s always a doubt that it might just be a true story--because war is just that absurd. An example that springs to mind is one of the most engaging pieces in the work. It\u2019s called \u201cSweetheart of Song Tra Bong,\u201d and it\u2019s about a wholesome, young girlfriend to one of the soldiers who [improbably] comes to live in the camp. The girl acclimates to the war, and soon she is going out on patrol--not with the ordinary infantry soldiers, but during the night with the Green Berets. Perhaps the moral is that some people are made for war, and it\u2019s never who you\u2019d suspect. As I describe it, the premise may sound ridiculous, but the way O\u2019Brien presents it as a story told by a Rat Kiley--a fellow infantryman known to exaggerate\u2014it feels as though there is something very true, no matter how fictitious the story might be. Before one reads \u201cSweetheart of Song Tra Bong\u201d one has been primed by a chapter entitled \u201cHow to Tell a True War Story,\u201d which tells one that truth and falsehood aren\u2019t so clear in the bizarre world of war.There are a couple chapters outside the period during which O\u2019Brien (the character, who may or may not be the same as the author) is actively in an infantry unit. One early chapter describes his near attempt at draft dodging, and another talks of his time stationed at the rear after being injured. Both of these chapters offer an interesting twist in the scheme of the book overall. We find O\u2019Brien to be a fairly typical infantry soldier, and it seems hard to reconcile this with his floating in a canoe and narrowly deciding not to make a swim for the Canadian shoreline.  However, what is odder still is realizing how distraught he is to be pulled out of his unit, particularly when he realizes that he has become an outsider and the [then rookie] medic who botched his treatment is now in the in-group. This is one of the many unusual aspects of combatant psychology that comes into play in the book, along with O\u2019Brien\u2019s description of how devastating it was to kill.There are 21 chapters to the book. As I said, they run a gamut, but at all times keep one reading. It\u2019s the shortest of the Vietnam novels I\u2019ve read\u2014I think. When I think of works like \u201cMatterhorn\u201d and \u201cThe 13th Valley,\u201d there seems to be something hard to convey concisely about the Vietnam War, but O\u2019Brien nails it with his unconventional novel. O\u2019Brien also uses repetition masterfully. This can be seen in the title chapter \u201cThe Things They Carried,\u201d which describes the many things carried by an infantry soldier\u2014both the physical items they carried on patrol and the psychological and emotional things they carried after the war.  It\u2019s a risky approach that pays off well.I\u2019d recommend this book for anyone\u2014at least anyone who can stomach war stories."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of my favorite books. Doesn\u2019t glorify war. Shows it for what it is and shows the effects that spending time fighting will have over you. Everyone is different, but Tim O\u2019Brien reveals stories from varied personalities.Such a good read."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Tim O'Brien is one of our greatest living war authors, in my opinion. He is the essential story teller of the Vietnam war. He does more than just relate events and characters, he creates a mythos that transcends the events and helps illustrate humanities' survival in the face of barbarity, and also the dark depths that reside in the human animal. A must read!"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I was eager to read this after seeing the author on Ken Burns' The Vietnam War series.

This is an excellent book for readers of all interests."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Downloaded for my daughter's summer reading project, ( it was on the school issued list ) and ended up reading it myself.
