It has had great reviews from readers and literary critics alike, and I was enchanted by The Golden Age.  So why was I so disappointed (and particularly why am I almost alone in this)?The story concerns a young woman Maya and her disappearance from her Melbourne flat.  Her parents Toni and Jacob are due to stay with her in Melbourne and their proposed reunion with their daughter turns into a search for Maya.Part of my difficulty is with the structure of the novel, and the difficulty this creates in identifying  with the characters.  Maya emerges as the protagonist in the first chapter, but almost immediately disappears, and only re-emerges towards the end.  We are introduced to her parents, and in long diversions their early lives are revealed.  This fragmentary style recurs throughout the novel, and one annoying habit of the writer is to subject the reader to several pages of \u201che said\u2026.\u201d and \u201cshe said\u2026\u201d without a clue as to who they are and in what era they are saying it.  This style also makes much of the behaviour of the characters difficult to believe; for example, Toni\u2019s behaviour when she apparently reverts to her hippie past does not ring true.  A chance meeting with a character from Toni\u2019s past seems very contrived.The writing style is excellent, but unfortunately I found this book much less than the sum of its parts."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This was the second of three Joan London books that I have read recently.  I am a convert.  Great development of characters and good sense of place, whether it be wheat belt Western Australia or inner city Melbourne"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "I found this book to be drawn out and a tiny bit tedious. I enjoy Joan London's writing but there was something about the plot which troubled me. I think it was the premise that this 18 year old girl would simply invite her parents to stay at her Melbourne flat then disappear with a man who had been clearly using her. The infatuation she seemed to have for her devious boss felt somewhat forced and unbelievable to me, paralleling of course, her own mother's experience with a similar sort of older man, Cy.Cy turns out to be quite useful in the end, but it's an end which is too long-winded in arriving. I even found myself skipping a few pages, something I wouldn't usually do if I'm enjoying a novel."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Excellent! Enjoyed it so much, love all her books"}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "It got me in, but jumps around a bit too much fro my liking. Too many character's names to keep up with."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Everyone has his own story. It might be funny or frightening, instructive or entertaining. It might bore some and excite others. Telling a story well, so others can relate to it easily, is the duty of the writer. Stories about ordinary people are particularly difficult. When crafted with excellence, the characters hit highs and lows, have flaws and fortes. They face the challenge of surviving in a world that often is cruel and uncaring, nourishing within themselves a careful consideration for their own well being and the same for others. I\u2019ve found a book that meets my qualifications and is a joy to read. \u201cThe Good Parents\u201d by Joan London. It features a teen-aged daughter seeking to reach adulthood through the time-honored fashion\u2014an older man\u2014along with the turmoil experienced by her mother and father, aging semi-hippies. There\u2019s a mystery, in fact several mysteries: will the daughter meet a terrible fate, and will a disreputable but powerful man in the mother\u2019s past bring doom? The beauty of this book, however, is neither plot nor action. Rather, the intricate weaving of the inner thoughts, the external impacts, the complex relationships, of the characters make you read faster and faster, to track the lives of people who somehow seem as close as dear friends or beloved relatives. The main characters as well as the secondary ones upon whom only a few pages may be expended are as faceted and radiant and entrancing as a diamond. Through this treatise on one family\u2019s lives, I grew to appreciate my own more. \u201cThe Good Parents\u201d is truly an example of how ordinary people can have extraordinary lives."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This is an interesting book. It describes the life of a young girl leaving her west Australian country town to live in the big city of Melbourne, Victoria. She has an affair with her married boss and goes missing. Her parents come looking for her. Along the way we discover interesting things about her parents' past, including her mother's first marriage to a crook, who later turns out to be something of a good guy, instrumental in getting their daughter back. Definitely worth reading."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "This was a book club book.The other reviews are good so I thought the book would be better, but I didn't like it at all.I wasn't interested in the characters and it jumped around so much.
