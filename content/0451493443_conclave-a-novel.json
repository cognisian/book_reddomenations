Once I understood more clearly, it still required a long brisk walk to process it all.  And then I loved it.  As the book sums it up: \"The Holy Spirit has done its work. They had picked the right man\" (p.390 paper ed.). Again, an internet search of the technical terms is strongly recommended; it's not exactly what I first thought.  But ultimately it's a win-win for the Church and for the faithful. Especially after slogging through all that venal \"sausage being made\" in selecting a Pope.Although perhaps not entirely credible that someone in his position would do that, another high point was Cardinal Lomeli's marvelous extemporaneous homily on Paul's letter to the Ephesians (pp. 124-128) - which of course, was distorted and loudly criticized afterwards by one of the ingredients in \"the sausage\" (an overly-ambitious Cardinal).Amazingly (but I suppose Harris researched all this), the sequestered Cardinals were served their ample food & drink by women!  Even more incongruously, they were nuns of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul.  This ancient order had endured several martyrs over the centuries.  As Harris cuttingly notes: \"Its members had not given up their lives in order to become waitresses for cardinals.  Its charism was supposed to be service to the poor\" (p.264).I also doubted that the 75-year old Cardinal Lomeli could have functioned as well as he did on so little sleep and nourishment.  But although he cut a few corners, he certainly got to the bottom of things.Except for one \"slowish\" section, an absolutely fascinating read.  For me, 4-1/2 stars."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "were so well constructed. You felt you were there. Obviously it was well studied.

The book led me along with great detail of the Vatican and the Conclave, scandal and pathos, keeping me on the edge of my seat from page to page. But I warn readers, the last 3 pages are not pleasant to any person who respects the Church. I was thoroughly enraged and completely disappointed that I let the author take me a long a very interested and engrossing story to the point where he laid the bombshell on me. It was a dirty literary trick to get a cheap shot at the dignity of the Church and the Papacy. I should have known better than to read a popular author writing fiction about the Church."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "A great read !"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "First read 1964 and have followed HarrisConclave is.
