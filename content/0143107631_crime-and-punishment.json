Enjoyed Crime and Punishment and got many insights into life in mid-nineteenth century Russia: poverty, degradation of the masses; male attitudes to women (frequent references to beatings etc.,); theological and philosophical theories prevalent amongst the ruling classes - not too disimiliar from those as expressed amongst today's 'elite' thinkers! Very informative; thoroughly enjoyable. Now reading The Brothers Karamasev - just as  reviting."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Interesting look into the initial stages of the thoughts and philosophy that led to the Russian revolution and ultimately the communist state."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "Multiple times on each page words run together so it is extremely hard to read.
