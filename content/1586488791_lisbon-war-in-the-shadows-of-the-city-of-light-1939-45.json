The description and introduction to this book describe a collection of stories of politics, spies and subterfuge in Lisbon during World War II, the ensuing chapters all seem to be about \"The Most Beautiful Dictator,\" Salazar, and how he brilliantly kept Portugal out of the war.While the fawning language about a tyrant is off-putting, I'm mostly annoyed that this is just not how the book was marketed. Perhaps patience leads to the promised stories, but based on the writing so far, I don't think I'll make it that far."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Exceptional research and writing.

It's not great writing, though. The book is very repetitive, and the narrative follows a seemingly random order. Some sentences are so vague they require multiple passes to be understood."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "This is basically a history of the Salazar regime.

They arrived at different times and a mutual friend was able to take the used copy to her in Argentina.  The \"new\" copy arrived too late and therefore is being saved in another NYC apartment for my friend to read and share when she returns to NY.  She is delighted to have nearly finished reading the book and reports the story is well-written and reminds her of the stories about difficulties her family and so many others had leading up to WW II."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "This was a fascinating look into a lesser known (at least for me) episode in WWII.

The only European city in which both the Allies and the Axis power operated openly, it was temporary home to much of Europe\u2019s exiled royalty, over one million refugees seeking passage to the U.S., and a host of spies, secret police, captains of industry, bankers, prominent Jews, writers and artists, escaped POWs, and black marketeers. An operations officer writing in 1944 described the daily scene at Lisbon\u2019s airport as being like the movie \u201cCasablanca,\u201d times twenty.\r\n\r\nIn this riveting narrative, renowned historian Neill Lochery draws on his relationships with high-level Portuguese contacts, access to records recently uncovered from Portuguese secret police and banking archives, and other unpublished documents to offer a revelatory portrait of the War\u2019s back stage. \r\n\r\nAnd he tells the story of how Portugal, a relatively poor European country trying frantically to remain neutral amidst extraordinary pressures, survived the war not only physically intact but significantly wealthier. The country\u2019s emergence as a prosperous European Union nation would be financed in part, it turns out, by a cache of Nazi gold.", "asin": "1586488791", "rank": "492259", "city": "Lisbon", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cx89jX9%2BL.jpg", "country": "Portugal", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
