Really informative.  At times quirky -- an interview with the Kazakh Beatle (a tribute band member), the story of Dostoevsky in Kazakhstan, apple growing in Almaty -- and other times a lot of substantive information such as about the death of the Aral sea -- a massive and largely unknown ecological disaster during Soviet times.  The author spent quite a bit of time with and interviewing the President of Kazakhstan who turns out to be an excellent politician who is extremely intelligent.  Fascinating background on the creation of the new capital Astana and the secret launch of the Kazakh currency.  I highly recommend this as the one book to read on Kazakhstan."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This book is a lovely read about a nation dear to my heart. This story is about the sovereign nation of Kazakhstan. The place of apples, tulips and horses. The book covered much of what I already knew, but also I learned new history and stories about the past that defines people's experience and the landscape. The stories are heartbreaking and are crucial to remember. The author shares an outsider experience to a nation, he hardly knows anything about. The story delivery was given unique occasions and tidbits of important historical figures. I would recommended this book to all who know nothing of my country or want to understand where I come from and who are Kazakhs.  5/5 stars"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Engaging!

I simply could not put it down and ended up reading through it much faster than I had ever anticipated.  Robbins' depictions of Kazakhstan and its people are both heartfelt and astute.  He blends the nation's history perfectly with his own adventures in the country, and the story moves along very swiftly.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in far-flung lands and the fascinating story of a nation and a people that few in the West will ever know."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Always enjoy these books"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "my cousin who's lived there for years says its a must-read"}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "One of the best book.

Few would guess that Kazakhstan\u2014a blank in Westerners' collective geography\u2014turns out to be diverse, tolerant, and surprisingly modern, the country that gave the world apples, trousers, and even, perhaps, King Arthur. \r\n\r\nChristopher Robbins enjoyed unprecedented access to the Kazakh president while crafting this travelogue, and he relates a story by turns hilarious and grim. He finds Eminem-worship by a shrinking Aral Sea, hears the Kazakh John Lennon play in a dusty desert town, joins nomads hunting eagles, eats boiled sheep's head (a delicacy), and explores some of the most beautiful, unspoiled places on earth. Observant and culturally attuned, Robbins is a master stylist in the tradition of travel writing as literature, a companion to V. S. Naipaul and Paul Theroux. 39 black-and-white illustrations", "asin": "1934633933", "rank": "242440", "city": "Kazakhstan", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51iLH3koZRL.jpg", "country": "", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
