It is superbly written - lyrical and detailed at the same time. It records a time in Australian history that is melancholic and this oozes from the pages. But it ends on a high note, a cliffhanger really, of great promise of things to come.It feels that you are 'there' as Johnston writes about people and places.The characters are real and well portrayed and the story line is gripping. The lines between this book and the lives of George Johnston/ Jack Johnston/ and Charmian Clift are blurry, but that is irrelevant. This book is haunting."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Very well written.

Different all through our lives, I mean, and in a special sense, not just older or nobler or braver or less clever.' \r\n\r\nDavid and Jack Meredith grow up in a patriotic suburban Melbourne household during the First World War, and go on to lead lives that could not be more different. through the story of the two brothers, George Johnston created an enduring exploration of two Australian myths: that of the man who loses his soul as he gains worldly success, and that of the tough, honest Aussie battler, whose greatest ambition is to serve his country during the war. \r\n\r\nAcknowledged as one of the true Australian classics, My Brother Jack is a deeply satisfying, complex and moving literary masterpiece. David Meredith's story continues in the sequels Clean Straw for Nothing and A Cartload of Clay. \r\n\r\n'Enthralling ...entertaining ...vividly original\" The Age", "asin": "0207187320", "rank": "4464668", "city": "Melbourne", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41r%2BEEQ8HbL.jpg", "country": "Australia", "story_arc": ["Tragedy", "Things only get worse"]}
