At the heart of Chang\u2019s achievement is her short fiction\u2014tales of love, longing, and the shifting and endlessly treacherous shoals of family life.\r\n\r\nWritten when Chang was still in her twenties, these extraordinary stories combine an unsettled, probing, utterly contemporary sensibility, keenly alert to sexual politics and psychological ambiguity, with an intense lyricism that echoes the classics of Chinese literature.\r\n\r\nLove in a Fallen City, the first collection in English of this dazzling body of work, introduces American readers to the stark and glamorous vision of a modern master.\r\n\r\n\u201c[A] giant of modern Chinese literature\u201d The New York Times\r\n\r\n\"With language as sharp as a knife edge, Eileen Chang cut open a huge divide in Chinese culture, between the classical patriarchy and our troubled modernity. She was one of the very few able truly to connect that divide, just as her heroines often disappeared inside it. She is the fallen angel of Chinese literature, and now, with these excellent new translations, English readers can discover why she is so revered by Chinese readers everywhere.\" Ang Lee", "asin": "1590171780", "rank": "160547", "city": "Hong Kong", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2B-JUH-iYL.jpg", "country": "China", "story_arc": ["Cinderella", "An initial rise in good fortunes, followed\n                    by a setback, but a happy ending"]}
