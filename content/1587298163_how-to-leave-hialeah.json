How to Leave Hialeah's central themes focus on things that are not good to say. Primary topics include physical appearance and bodily functions, both presented with raw vulgarity. The writing style can make the stories difficult to follow as the narrator clumsily becomes an active character's voice and back again, without regard for grammar. These aspects fuse to create a unique genre that roughly equates to reality television for literature. This bold move will no doubt win several fans."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "No thank you.  I am reading, writing and not rating,  But thank you for asking.

But ow to Leave Hialeah may be even a little better. The book consists of several stories, many told in first person. One of my favorites is about a funeral. Hilarious! But maybe the favorite is told by the narrator of \"The Next Move.\" Let me give you just one paragraph. He is talking with his married daughter after having dropped his wife, Nilda, off at MIA to fly back to Cuba to visit her sisters: \"I was on the kitchen phone since it had the long cord, and I'd taken off my socks to clip my toenails while we talked. It needed to be done. I've always liked clipping off the nail in one whole piece, so that I can make a pile of these thick yellow half-moons on the table, which made it easier for Nilda to clean up. she always complained about it, but she never realized I was trying to make it easier for her.\"And know this too: he is dedicated to his new Tai Chi class!This is just too wonderful a read.
