I read it in the middle of the nights when I woke up several times throughout, in the mornings, on my breaks at work. I felt as if I could see and understand  the lives of my family that I have traced back to the early 1,800\"s in Old San Juan. My family members were too from Spain, in the military, slave owners and born from slaves as well. I learned so much about the history of my people. Thankful to Ms.Santiago for bringing it to life for me. And thankful to my cousin Ron for finding me and filling in the missing gaps of our family tree."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Whenever I read a book this good, it saddens me to have it end. History, romance,  strong character and determination, all set in beautiful Puerto Rico is the perfect mix. Thank you, what a great trip it has been. I can't wait to read it again to practice more spanish and see what I missed by being so hasty to find out what happens."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "I am in the Chicano book club, so therefore this book was chosen for the month.
