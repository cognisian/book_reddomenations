Such graceful fiction from scholar/essayist/sinologist/quirky renaissance man Simon Leys (pen name of Pierre Ryckmans), a work I read and reread and then narrated into my digital recorder so I could listen and thus take an even deeper plunge into the pool of this inventive fable.What a pleasure to read a real writer. . . \u2018The Death of Napoleon\u2019 is utterly satisfying sentence by sentence and scene by scene, but it is also compulsively readable. These are the words of renowned literary critic Gabriel Josipovici, words with which I wholeheartedly agree. And to underscore my agreement, I\u2019ll serve up a few slices of Leys poetic, that is, three quotes from scenes in Chapter One that chronicle Napoleon\u2019s voyage on board a ship carrying the world-famous emperor from St. Helena back to his beloved France. And, yes, of course, this is imaginative alternate history.A snippet of the author\u2019s description of the ship\u2019s cook: \u201cHe was tall, but a good half century spend over stoves in low-ceilinged galleys had broken him up into several angular segments, like a half-folded pocket rule. Without really being fat, his body swelled out arbitrarily in places, giving him the shape of a semi-deflated balloon. His face was split by a huge gaping mouth; in this grotto, as black and dirty as the maw of his stove, there emerged one or two teeth, like slimy rocks protruding at low tide. The ruined state of his teeth made his speech, already bizarre, all the harder to understand, endowing his rare utterances with a kind of oracular force \u2013 as befits a black cook on a sailing ship who, to be true to type, must naturally have a smattering of occult sciences.\u201d Wow! I mean, Super-Wow! -- exquisite visual images; expressive vivid metaphors.\u201cEvery evening, crushed by the fatigue of the day\u2019s work, Napoleon would escape for a moment from the stuffy atmosphere of the forecastle and lean against the bulwark in the bows to watch the first stars come out. The softness of the tropical azure giving way slowly to the velvet of night, and the glittering of the lonely stars which seem so close to us when they begin to shine in the dusk, left him perfectly cold.\u201d If you have never had an opportunity to stand on the deck of a ship at sea and watch tropical azure give way slowly to the velvet of night, here is your opportunity to not only experience via your imagination but to join Napoleon in doing so.Napoleon assumes the identity of a cabin boy by the name of Eug\u00e8ne in order to escape from St. Helena. At one point we read of Napoleon\u2019s self-reflection: \u201cDuring this time in limbo, and until the day when Napoleon\u2019s sun would rise again, he had to survive by relying upon wretched Eug\u00e8ne's purely physical existence. Only the slenderest thread was leading him back toward the hypothetical dawn of his future. So far, at every stage of his journey, a new, unknown messenger had emerged from the shadows to show him the route to follow.\u201d Again, on one level Simon Leys\u2019 slim novel is a meditation on the nature of identity and time. And what an identity! After all, he is Napoleon.Thank you, New York Review Books (NYRB) for reprinting this slim classic. And thanks to Patricia Clancy for joining Mr. Leys in translating from the French into English. 130 pages of large font \u2013 this novella can be read in less than 3 hours.

I have three times over and counting, but then again, when it comes to ecstasy I admit that I have never observed moderation."}, {"review_sentiment": 1.0, "review_text": "Really disappointed with this book!Not sure what I expected but I felt there was no story,poorly written etc,etc."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Nicely written."}, {"review_sentiment": 4.0, "review_text": "Novella length treatment of Napoleon escapes exile ends up in Belgium travels to Paris via Waterloo and we see how \"the great\" fall and quickly pass on, the scene at Waterloo and the insane asylum are wonderful.

And so, for convenience, that is what we shall call him.\r\n\r\nBesides, he was Napoleon. . . .\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon has escaped from St. Helena, leaving a double behind him. Now disguised as the cabin hand Eug\u00e8ne Lenormand and enduring the mockery of the crew (Na\u00adpo\u00adleon, they laughingly nickname the pudgy, hopelessly clumsy little man), he is on his way back to Europe, ready to make contact with the huge secret organization that will return him to power. But then the ship on which he sails is rerouted from Bordeaux to Antwerp. When Napoleon disembarks, he is on his own.\r\n\r\nHe revisits the battlefield of Waterloo, now a tourist destination. He makes his way to Paris. Mistakes, misunderstandings, and mishaps conduct our puzzled hero deeper and deeper into the mystery of Napoleon.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlternative history...is enjoyable and at the same time, like all daydreaming, brings a sensation of guilt.
