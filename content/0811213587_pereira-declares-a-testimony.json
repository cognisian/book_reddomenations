Fascism under Franco of Spain is creeping into neighboring Portugal as well under its dictator Salazar. A kosher meat shop the main character frequents is vandalized by fascist thugs.Pereira, our main character, is a journalist having his mid-life crisis. His wife died a few years ago and he regrets that they never had children. He\u2019s aging, lonely, overweight. He writes about art and literature and seems so disconnected from the political winds that a couple of friends, one a priest, tell him \u201cstop living in another world; go out and see what\u2019s happening all around you.\u201d At night he tells his wife\u2019s photo about his day and asks her opinion about things.Kind of accidentally he starts to get politically active in a big way. He hires a young man as an assistant who is assisting anti-fascist forces in Spain and trying to recruit Portuguese to fight. He has a beautiful girlfriend and a male friend who makes fake passports. The journalist reads the political writings of the assistant which he knows he can\u2019t publish because of Portuguese censorship. But he starts helping them out by giving them money and housing them when they are running from the law. He sees the son he did not have in the idealistic young man and the beautiful, daring girlfriend doesn\u2019t hurt the cause either. Inevitably, one night the Portuguese secret police come knocking and turn his world upside down.I liked this passage: \u201cPhilosophy appears to concern itself only with the truth, but perhaps expresses only fantasies, while literature appears to concern itself only with fantasies, but perhaps it expresses the truth.\u201dAnd this response from his friend, the priest, after Pereira says he wants to make confession the next time he visits: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to, replied Father Antonio, first make sure you commit some sin and then come to me, don\u2019t make me waste my time for nothing.\u201dI liked the way the heavy duty political theme was interspersed with humor, mostly about Pereira\u2019s struggles with his weight and diet. Every day he is challenged to get up stairs and hills, yet eats rich omelets and drinks eight glasses of lemonade that is half sugar. He goes to spas for thalassotherapy (seawater and seaweed treatments) as if he expects the weight to simply dissolve. The spa directors believe in working with his mind as well as his body despite resistance from Pereira. \u201cPretty soon you\u2019ll start talking to your wife\u2019s photograph,\u201d he is told. Of course we know Pereira already does.The book has an interesting background. \u201cPereira declares\u201d is a mantra throughout the book, usually at chapter endings. But the book has also been translated into English as \u201cDeclares Pereira\u201d and \u201cPereira Maintains.\u201d The author is Italian and the book is translated from the Italian but he loved Portuguese culture, lived for periods in Portugal, and died there. He was famous in Italy for translations of Portuguese works into Italian, especially the work of Fernando Pessoa. This book was made into an Italian movie. It\u2019s fairly short (135 pages) and held my attention all the way through. My thanks to Ian of Scotland for recommending this book to me."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Interesting book-hard to catch on to at first but then it grabs you. Worth reading- suggest it to all you history buffs."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "This plot is set in Portugal, during a dictatorship, coinciding w the Spanish Civil War. Pereira is an elderly widower, who writes the cultural page of a local newspaper. He has never been involved in politics, but somehow gets dragged into making a statement via ai professional relationship with a young writer. The story is told as if being dictated in a legal declaration of events, where Pereira is the accused of an unknown crime. Pereira is pushed to take sides by his ethical values, almost against himself - a priorly average man, w no political interest. As a writer, he translates French literature, and although the pieces he translates -Balzac's stories- might have been written many years before, in another generation, they still prove to be true when applied to the onset of Nazi Germany invading France. Which gets Pereira in trouble, as Portugal is starting to side w the forces of fascism. The book was made into a movie, acting Marcello Mastroiani. Easy read, w Kafkaest tones. I had read it in Spanish translation many years before."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Pereira has settled his life once for all. His work: a journalist in charge of the literary section of a newspaper from Lisbon in which he translates French tales not at all on harmony with the Director wishes: French ideas were not compatible with the strong influence and help given by Germany to Franco and Salazar. His family life: a widower who uses to speak to his wife's photograph several times a day; no children, no friends except Father Antonio with whom he chats when some problem grieves his mind, specially the question of death, his obsession, as well as the resurrection of the body he doesn't accept because his is too fat and tired. With the waiter attending the restaurant where he has lunch, he discusses politics in spite of his lack of interest: his paper is independent and apolitical and the Salazar dictatorship doesn't hurt his feelings...until one day, after hiring a recently graduated young man, his life begins to change very slowly but firmly, toward a direction he never thought he would reach. Little by little his conscience awoke.  In 1995, Antonio Tabucchi, completely astonished, saw the multitude shouting in the streets against Berlusconi, brandishing \"Pereira declares\" which turned to be the book symbol of the left opposition. \"A fat Portuguese became an Italian hero\", the author summed up, smiling."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I have expressed my enthusiasm for this book elsewhere on this site, but under the title Pereira Maintains. In fact, it is the same book by the same author and the same translator.  Pereira Declares is an edition published by New Directions, the American publisher, whereas Pereira Maintains is published by Canongate in Great Britain.However, the differences, though few in number, do not stop there, and they are rather important.Patrick Creagh is the translator for both editions, and Pereira Maintains is his revised version of Pereira Declares, which appeared about 15 years earlier in the U.S.  However, I have compared both editions and the only difference which I noticed was the title. Yet since it appears as a constantly used phrase in slightly varying forms throughout the entire novel, I guess you you say that this is an important revision.At this point, you may say there isn't enough variation between the two editions to make one preferable to the other, but I would caution potential readers about one other difference. Pereira Declares is printed in fairly small type which seems squeezed into a book of only 136 pages. Pereira Maintains has much more generous-sized print spread out over 195 pages.  If you are reading this book on paper, Pereira Maintains is much more attractive and reader-friendly.In either edition, it's a novel well worth reading, in an excellent translation (as I explained in my review), but I much preferred reading it in the Canongate version."}, {"review_sentiment": 2.0, "review_text": "It moved rather slow & did not have much to say. If you are interested in pre-wwII portugal, you may like it."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "\"Pereira Declares\" is an intense burst of writing dealing with oppression and the suppression of free speech.  Taking place in pre-WWII fascist Portugal, the story centers around a small time journalist named Pereira who, despite his every inclination, becomes involved with a small time revolutionary fighting the overwhelming tide of fascism.  Acting out of the simplest human kindness, Pereira aides the rebel despite his reluctance to get involved with the politics that he knows will only lead him to trouble.  Once his eyes are opened, however, to the censorship that is going on, Pereira begins to take chances himself, at first small, and then life-changing, as he discovers truth in the great writers of the past and becomes inspired to affect change himself.  With all that is happening in the world today- the Arab Spring, the Occupy Movement across the United States- \"Pereira Declares\" is a strong statement in support of free speech and standing up for what one believes is right.  The names and dates may be different, but Antonio Tabucchi has written a portrait of one seemingly ineffectual Portuguese man that has a lot to say about what is going on in the world today."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "What an ever more vivid tapestry of World War II-era Europe modern writers continue to create. Whether it's because of Robert Wilson (A Small Death in Lisbon), Alan Furst, Marcel Aym\u00e9 (Uranus), Giorgio Bassani (Il giardino dei Finzi-Contini), Jos\u00e9 Saramago (O ano da morte de Ricardo Reis) or Antonio Tabucchi, I feel ever more engrossed in an era I'd given little thought to until I started reading such authors.Pereira Declares is a portrait in miniature, and it reminds me that you don't have to evoke sweeping historical panoramas to write effectively on grand themes like the spread of fascism over 1930s Europe. (Of course, Alan Furst has already shown that in spades.) It's the spare, elegant story of a once-prominent reporter now relegated to obscurity as the culture-page editor for a second-rate Lisbon newspaper. He becomes entangled with the resistance against the dictatorship of Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar, Portugal's counterpart to General\u00edsimo Francisco Franco of Spain.It would seem implausible that Pereira should see fit to take up with the feckless and foolish resistance follower Monteiro Rossi--the reader senses looming disaster almost from the novella's beginning--but Tabucchi convinces at least this reader that Pereira did so because he's a sentimentalist like Casablanca's Rick Blaine rather than a pragmatist like Captain Renault.The translator did an excellent job of translating Tabucchi's idiosyncratic style, which, like Jos\u00e9 Saramago's but less extremely, relies on run-on sentences and an absence of quotation marks. A couple of times he renders a place name from Italian directly into something not quite Portuguese (A Dolorosa comes out as La Dolorosa, the Gra\u00e7a neighborhood as La Gra\u00e7a), and Tabucchi may have mistyped the Cais do Sodr\u00e9 as the Cais de Sodr\u00e9, and, conversely, P\u00f3voa de Varzim as P\u00f3voa do Varzim. Obviously these are trivial things and I notice them only because I'm a translator myself."}, {"review_sentiment": 3.0, "review_text": "Kaplan declares that he read an article quoting some writers he admired who recommended Tabucchi's Pereira Declares.  One writer said that he was in awe of Tabucchi's simple, but high impact prose.  The reviews on Amazon were also full of praise for the book.  With such a recommendation, Kaplan declares that he ordered Pereira Declares via the most wonderful inter-library loan.  When the book arrived, he found that the book was short, really a novella.Kaplan declares that the first thing anyone reading the book will notice is the \"tic\" \"Pereira declares\" scattered through the prose.  He was not sure what the point of this was.  Perhaps it was meant to indicate that Pereira was bearing witness to the fascist Salizar government in Portugal.  This is suggested by the subtitle: \"A Testimony\".  Kaplan declares that he decided to write this review in this odd style to give the reader a feeling for the prose in Pereira Declares.The story in Pereira Declares is set in the hot Portuguese summer.  In keeping with the setting, Kaplan declares that he found the story, although short, languid and meandering.  The main character, Pereira, seems to be directed by subconscious motivations, drifting toward the final plot culmination.  Perhaps the style lost a lot in translation, Kaplan declares.  While he speaks and reads a little Italian, he read the book in english translation.  What ever the case, the style is not particularly compelling and Kaplan declares that he does not understand the esteem in which Tabucchi is held.  The book was tedious and it was difficult to care about any of the characters.  Kaplan declares that he was glad that he did not spend money on this book and he is, once again, grateful for inter-library loan."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "Fear of speaking out at work is a manifestation of larger political and social forces than simply a dysfunctional administration at one's place of work. If we assess our working life as part of a system we will begin to see where repression comes from and we can begin to develop a philosophical, ethical and political framework to overcome fear. Certain kinds of governments unleash and empower the petty dictator within some bureaucrats. Without a larger world view than our cubicle in our office in our building we can easily be made to feel threatened, marginalized or isolated when we speak up for what we deem is right action. And there is nothing good about being threatened, marginalized or isolated. Through reading and literature we gain the best understanding of how a government sets the tone for repression that eventually becomes fear to speak at work.Pereira, a journalist in Lisbon (1938), slowly realizes that by acceding to government censors in the choice of books he reviews that his culture is being compromised:\"Well then, said the editor-in-chief, I really didn't expect this latest thing. What latest thing?, asked Pereira, That panegyric on France, said the editor-in-chief, has caused a lot of offence in high places. What panegyric on France? asked Pereira totally bewildered. Come now Pereira ! exclaimed the editor-in-chief, you published a story by Alphonse Daudet about the Franco-Prussian War which ended with the phrase, \" `Vive la France!\".
