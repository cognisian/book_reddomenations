Like Elena Ferrante in her Neopolitan novels, Pamuk takes us into a very particular place (Istanbul) as it experiences modernization, through the experience of characters who are \"ordinary\" and yet tremendously compelling as individuals.  He structures the text by alternating third person narration with sections that directly convey the voice/thoughts of the characters."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I have to say, it took me some time to get through the first 150 pages. When I was in Turkey recently, I had no other distractions and plowed through the rest of the book in four days. I see some didn't like the structure - I can see that, but it's quite unique and really makes it feel like a true story. Many times during the book I paused to ask my Turkish husband about certain aspects and he corroborated what was written, making it even more enjoyable. Since it's long and the book was heavy, I left it at the airport...hopefully someone picked it up and will enjoy it as much as I."}, {"review_sentiment": 5.0, "review_text": "I read anything Orhan Pamuk writes.
