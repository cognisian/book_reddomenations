She combines the details of the story, descriptions of parts of the enchanting city of Venice, with great humor and elegance.  I wonder what the view of the Venice police are, of this series?  There you have the useless Alvise, the pompous fool, Patta and the ever philosyphising Vianello, and the enchanting Elettra.  Good stories with interesting characters and wonderful humor.  Not enough is said about how humorous Leon can be.  I often laugh out loud with her books.

All the clues point to a violent mugging, but for Brunetti the motive of robbery seems altogether too convenient. When something is discovered in the victim\u2019s apartment that suggests the existence of a high-level conspiracy, Brunetti becomes convinced that somebody is taking great pains to provide a ready-made solution to the crime.\r\n\r\nRich with atmosphere and marvelous plotting, Death in a Strange Country is a superb novel in Donna Leon\u2019s chilling Venetian mystery series.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat makes Leon\u2019s work especially unnerving is the sense that corruption is a continuing process. . . . The characters of Brunetti and his family continue to deepen throughout this series.\u201d The Times (UK)", "asin": "0802146023", "rank": "84717", "city": "Venice", "image": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5136VNVH-vL.jpg", "country": "Italy", "story_arc": ["Rags_To_Riches", "The story gets better over time"]}
